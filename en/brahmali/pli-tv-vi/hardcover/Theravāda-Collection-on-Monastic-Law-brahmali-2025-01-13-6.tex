\scbyline{Bhikkhu Brahmali, 2024}

The present volume is the last of six, the total of which constitutes a complete translation of the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka}, the Monastic Law. This volume consists of the \textsanskrit{Parivāra}, “the Compendium”. In the present introduction, I will do a brief survey of the contents of volume 6 and make observations of points of particular interest. For a general introduction to the Monastic Law, see volume 1.

The word \textit{\textsanskrit{parivāra}} normally means “entourage”, as in a king’s retinue, or “accompaniment”, as in side dishes to the main part of a meal. In the present context, it would then seem to mean something that “accompanies” the Vinaya proper, that is, the Sutta-\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga} and the Khandhakas. As to its content, the \textsanskrit{Parivāra} is a detailed and condensed systematization of the most important rules and regulations of the first five volumes of the Vinaya. It is to reflect this context that I have chosen to render \textsanskrit{Parivāra} as Compendium.\footnote{Here is the definition of compendium from Oxford Dictionaries online: “A concise but detailed information about a particular subject, especially in a book or other publication”. }

The \textsanskrit{Parivāra} is significantly later than the rest of the Canonical Vinaya. As we shall see, the work speaks of the arrival of the \textsanskrit{Tipiṭaka} in Sri Lanka and gives a long list of Vinaya Masters at the \textsanskrit{Mahāvihāra},\footnote{At \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr1.1/en/brahmali\#3.56}{Pvr~1.1:3.56}–19.4. } the most important monastery in Sri Lanka in the early centuries after its arrival there. Oskar von Hinüber estimates that it was composed at the earliest in the first century CE.\footnote{Hinüber, 2000, § 42. } I. B. Horner (BD, p. ix) quotes Rhys Davids and Oldenberg as follows:

\begin{quotation}%
“… [T]his work [the \textsanskrit{Parivāra}], an abstract of the other parts of the Vinaya, is in fact a very much later compilation, and probably the work of a Ceylonese Thera.”\footnote{Rhys Davids, 1881, part I, p. xxiv. }

%
\end{quotation}

The work as a whole has no discernible structure. Each chapter has its own inner logic, but there is no obvious connection between the individual chapters. The overall impression is of a work that has been haphazardly assembled over time, with new material simply added to the end on an ongoing basis.

Still, the \textsanskrit{Parivāra} has its own peculiar style. Most of the material is presented in a question-and-answer format,\footnote{Only a few chapters do not have this format, namely, Pvr 3, 9, 14–15, 17, and in part 13 and 21. The total page count of these is less than 20\% of the \textsanskrit{Parivāra}. } and occasionally as questions without answers, as in \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr20/en/brahmali}{Pvr~20}. This, combined with its systematic organization of the Vinaya material, suggests that the \textsanskrit{Parivāra} was used as a manual for students. This is what I. B. Horner has to say of the matter:

\begin{quotation}%
“Indeed, to provide a manual for instructors and students may well have been a reason for its compilation.”\footnote{BD, vol. VI, p. x. }

%
\end{quotation}

It may even be that it was used to test advanced students, such as those who were preparing to be Vinaya teachers. This is suggested especially by Pvr 20, delightfully named “The sudorific verses”,\footnote{In plain English, “the sweat-inducing verses”. } which consists of a series of Vinaya conundrums that only especially knowledgeable monastics would be able to solve. The questions look a bit like an entrance exam to an elite university! The solutions are only found in the commentaries.

Overall, I refer more often to the commentaries in this volume than I have in the previous five. The reason for this is the significant number of cryptic passages throughout the \textsanskrit{Parivāra}.

Because the \textsanskrit{Parivāra} is mostly a systematic presentation of material from the rest of the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka}, it does not contain much that is new. Occasionally, however, the \textsanskrit{Parivāra} does add details not found elsewhere. This is especially noticeable in Pvr 16, “The subdivision on the Robe-making ceremony”, where important details fill in the otherwise incomplete description at Kd 7. Similarly, Pvr 14 and 15 add details not found elsewhere in the Vinaya. These are examples of the \textsanskrit{Parivāra} acting as a kind of early commentary. This, then, is a secondary function of the \textsanskrit{Parivāra}.

To restate what we have seen so far, I would propose that the \textsanskrit{Parivāra} can be regarded as having at least three distinct purposes:

\begin{itemize}%
\item It is a concise restatement of the content of the earlier parts of the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka}%
\item It contains questions to be used for testing students%
\item It is an early commentary that explains passages in the first five volume of the Canonical Vinaya texts.%
\end{itemize}

Before I move on to the content of the individual chapters, I need to briefly comment on the mnemonic verses at the end of each chapter, the so-called \textit{\textsanskrit{uddānas}}. As we found for the Khandhakas, the \textit{\textsanskrit{uddānas}} do not always fully reflect the content of the chapter they belong to. For instance, the \textit{\textsanskrit{uddāna}} that immediately follows Pvr 9, summarizing the content of the \textsanskrit{Parivāra} up to this point, is missing references to chapters 3 and 6, while chapter 8 is called “invitation ceremony” instead of the expected “observance-day ceremony”. Careful study of these anomalies may help us reconstruct the historical development of the \textsanskrit{Parivāra}, and as such this area deserves detailed investigation.

Another noteworthy aspect of the \textit{\textsanskrit{uddānas}} is that they do not always conform to what we find in the earlier volumes of the Vinaya. For instance, in the first two chapters of the \textsanskrit{Parivāra}, which are concerned with the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} rules and their analysis, we would expect the \textit{\textsanskrit{uddānas}} to be the same as what we have in the Sutta-\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga}. Yet this is not always the case. Here is a comparison of two parallel \textit{\textsanskrit{uddāna}} verses, each containing a list of the first ten \textit{bhikkhu nissaggiya \textsanskrit{pācittiya}} rules.

\begin{verse}%
\textbf{Sutta-\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga} (Bu NP 1–10):}

\textit{\textsanskrit{Ubbhataṁ} \textsanskrit{kathinaṁ} \textsanskrit{tīṇi}},\\
\textit{\textsanskrit{dhovanañca} \textsanskrit{paṭiggaho}};\\
\textit{\textsanskrit{Aññātakāni} \textsanskrit{tīṇeva}},\\
\textit{\textsanskrit{ubhinnaṁ} \textsanskrit{dūtakena} \textsanskrit{cāti}}.

“Three on the ended robe season,\\

And washing, receiving;\\

Three on those who are unrelated,\\

Of both, and with messenger.”\footnote{At \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np10/en/brahmali\#2.4.11}{Bu~NP~10:2.4.11}. }

%
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}%
\textbf{\textsanskrit{Parivāra} (Bu NP 1–10):}

\textit{\textsanskrit{Dasekarattimāso} ca},\\
\textit{\textsanskrit{dhovanañca} \textsanskrit{paṭiggaho}};\\
\textit{\textsanskrit{Aññātaṁ} \textsanskrit{tañca} uddissa},\\
\textit{\textsanskrit{ubhinnaṁ} \textsanskrit{dūtakena} ca}.

“Ten, one day, and a month;\\

And washing, receiving;\\

Unrelated, and that one, for the sake of;\\

Of both, and with messenger.”\footnote{At \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr1.1/en/brahmali\#116.1}{Pvr~1.1:116.1}. }

%
\end{verse}

As can be seen, the differences are quite substantial, including different names for the same rule. Similar differences exist for other rules, including Bu Pc 11–30.

Why are there such differences in texts that ostensibly hail from the same tradition? Could it be that the tradition is not the same after all? Or that it is mixed? Or might it be that the \textit{\textsanskrit{uddānas}} in the \textsanskrit{Parivāra} are a recent addition to a work that was never recited orally? Unfortunately, I will have to leave the exploration of these interesting questions for another occasion.

Now let us turn to a brief overview of the content of the 21 chapters of the \textsanskrit{Parivāra}.

\section*{Pvr 1.1–2.16}

Pvr 1 and 2, which are each divided into sixteen sections, \textit{\textsanskrit{vāras}}, are the two longest chapters of the \textsanskrit{Parivāra}. They would have been much longer except for the heavy abbreviations, yet even in their current form, they account for almost 40\% of the \textsanskrit{Parivāra}’s total page count in the PTS edition. They are a summary and classification of the content of the Sutta-\textsanskrit{vibhaṅgas}, the first three volumes of the present translation series. Pvr 1 concerns the \textsanskrit{Mahā}-\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga}, whereas Pvr 2 is about the \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī}-\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga}. Both have a question-and-answer format.

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr1.1/en/brahmali}{Pvr~1.1}, “Questions and answers on the monks’ \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} rules and their analysis”, classifies the rules according to a standard set of Vinaya criteria. These include whether the rules are main or subsidiary, whether they are universally applicable or not, whether they apply to both Sanghas or only one, whether they are moral transgressions or otherwise, etc. Some of these classifications are more perfunctory than meaningful. For instance, the question is raised of what the Monastic Code is, with the reply being that it is the training rules.\footnote{At \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr1.1/en/brahmali\#3.34}{Pvr~1.1:3.34}. }

The last question for each rule is “Who handed it down?”, to which the reply is a long list of teachers, starting with \textsanskrit{Upāli} who recited the Vinaya at the first Council.\footnote{At \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr1.1/en/brahmali\#3.56}{Pvr~1.1:3.56}–19.4. } It then lists another four teachers, all based in India, ending with Moggaliputta. According to the Pali tradition, Moggaliputta presided over the so-called third Council, which effectively authorized the school of Buddhism that initially flourished in Sri Lanka and later in much of South-east Asia, and which is now known as Theravada Buddhism.\footnote{The third Council is described in the Vinaya commentary, the \textsanskrit{Samantapāsādikā}. }

The same list continues with another five names, headed by Ashoka’s son Mahinda, who were the monks that brought the \textsanskrit{Tipiṭaka} from India to Sri Lanka.\footnote{At \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr1.1/en/brahmali\#5.1}{Pvr~1.1:5.1}–6.4. } Then follows another 29 monks who are described as the Vinaya masters of Sri Lanka with the following words: “These mighty beings of great wisdom, knowers of the Monastic Law and skilled in the path, proclaimed the Collection of Monastic Law on the island of Sri Lanka”.\footnote{\textit{Ete \textsanskrit{nāgā} \textsanskrit{mahāpaññā}, \textsanskrit{vinayaññū} \textsanskrit{maggakovidā}, \textsanskrit{vinayaṁ} \textsanskrit{dīpe} \textsanskrit{pakāsesuṁ}, \textsanskrit{piṭakaṁ} \textsanskrit{tambapaṇṇiyāti}}. (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr1.1/en/brahmali\#19.1}{Pvr~1.1:19.1}) } This succession of Vinaya teachers, and especially Moggaliputta and Mahinda, deserves careful study. The overall pattern, including the full list of Vinaya masters, is repeated for every offense in the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha}. The amount of repetition is huge.

Pvr 1.1 also includes an interesting passage on the little understood term \textit{abhivinaya}, and by extension the related word \textit{abhidhamma}. Here is that passage:

\begin{quotation}%
“What is the Monastic Law (\textit{vinaya}) there? What is concerned with the Monastic Law (\textit{abhivinaya}) there?” The rules (\textit{\textsanskrit{paññatti}}) are the Monastic Law. Their analysis (\textit{vibhatti}) is concerned with the Monastic Law.\footnote{\textit{Ko tattha vinayo, ko tattha abhivinayoti? \textsanskrit{Paññatti} vinayo, vibhatti abhivinayo.} (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr1.1/en/brahmali\#3.32}{Pvr~1.1:3.32}–3.35) }

%
\end{quotation}

\textit{Vibhatti} is just an alternative to the term \textit{\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga}}, both words being derived from the same underlying root and prefix, \textit{vi} + \textit{bhaj}. Here is the commentarial explanation:

\begin{quotation}%
The definitions (\textit{\textsanskrit{padabhājana}}) are called \textit{vibhatti}; for \textit{vibhatti} is a name for the analysis (\textit{\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga}}).\footnote{Sp 5.2: \textit{\textsanskrit{Vibhattīti} \textsanskrit{padabhājanaṁ} vuccati; \textsanskrit{vibhattīti} hi \textsanskrit{vibhaṅgassevetaṁ} \textsanskrit{nāmaṁ}.} }

%
\end{quotation}

We have seen in the introduction to volume 1 that the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga} is an early commentary on the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} rules, and as such it is “about” those rules. A reasonable rendering of the prefix \textit{abhi}-, then, is “about”, with \textit{abhivinaya} becoming “about the Vinaya”.

If we extend this understanding to \textit{abhidhamma}, we get the meaning “about the Dhamma”, which would then be a reference to a commentarial kind of literature. This suggests that in the earliest period the new \textit{abhidhamma} material was considered a commentary on the Dhamma. Rather than being the ultimate expression of the Dhamma, it was understood to be a secondary kind of literature.

I will just briefly summarize the content of the remainder of Pvr 1 and 2. The next section, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr1.2/en/brahmali}{Pvr~1.2}, “The number of offenses within each offense”, lists every class of offense that may be committed under each rule, including any derived offenses mentioned in the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga} material. The next five sections follow in a similar vein, listing a variety of matters in relation to each offense. Section 1.8 then repeats the content of the previous six sections. The text is so repetitive as to be almost entirely abbreviated away. This is even more true of next eight sections, Pvr 1.9–1.16, which are an almost verbatim repetition of the previous eight, with only a marginal change in wording.\footnote{The main difference in wording can be exemplified by Bu Ss 2: “offense entailing suspension \textbf{for} making physical contact with a woman” at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr1.1/en/brahmali\#44.1}{Pvr~1.1:44.1} vs. “offense entailing suspension \textbf{that is a result of} making physical contact with a woman” at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr1.9/en/brahmali\#15.1}{Pvr~1.9:15.1}. }

In Pvr 2.1–2.16 the entire process is repeated for the \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī}-\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga}.

\section*{Pvr 3–6}

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr3/en/brahmali}{Pvr~3}, “The origination of offenses”, sets up an elaborate scheme of how the three doors of action—body, speech, and mind—in various combinations serve as the origination of offenses. In the opening verses, which are largely a homage to the Buddha, we encounter the word \textsanskrit{Parivāra}, the only time it occurs in the text itself. It is then said that those who are virtuous and love the Dhamma should train in this Compendium. Following the opening verses, the main content of this chapter is little more than a list of the various originations and which \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} rules they are associated with. \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr4/en/brahmali}{Pvr~4}, “More on the origination of offenses”, continues the discussion of Pvr 3, adding material on the relationship between the originations and other aspects of the training, such as the classes of offenses, the kinds of failures (\textit{vipatti}), and the kinds of legal issues.

This focus on the origination (\textit{\textsanskrit{samuṭṭhāna}}) of offenses is a hallmark of the \textsanskrit{Parivāra}. Whereas the rest of the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka} hardly makes use of this term,\footnote{It is found twice in the Samatha-kkhandhaka at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd14/en/brahmali\#14.6.1}{Kd~14:14.6.1}. } it is found over a thousand times in this text. Although intention, and therefore the nature of the origination of an offense, is a factor in a significant number of \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} rules, it is here presented from a largely theoretical perspective. We can perhaps sense a shift in the priorities of the Sangha in the centuries after the Buddha passed away. It seems that parts of the Sangha were becoming more involved in academic pursuits and less in the practical implementation of the path to awakening.

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr5/en/brahmali}{Pvr~5}, “The legal issues and their settling”, concerns the four kinds of legal issues, \textit{\textsanskrit{adhikaraṇas}}, especially the causes for their arising and the means for settling them. This chapter is particularly dry. Much of the content is taken up with abstract relationships between the seven principles for settling legal issues.

Pvr 5 is closely connected to Kd 14, for instance in its use of the triad wholesome, unwholesome, and indeterminate, which is otherwise only found in the Abhidhamma and the later parts of the Sutta \textsanskrit{Piṭaka}. Further on, Pvr 5 uses the expression \textit{\textsanskrit{yasmiṁ} samaye}, “on whatever occasion”, in a way that is reminiscent of the Abhidhamma. The parallel expression in the Suttas is instead \textit{\textsanskrit{ekaṁ} \textsanskrit{samayaṁ}}, “on one occasion”, and in the Vinaya \textit{tena samayena}, “on that occasion”. The influence of the Abhidhamma on the \textsanskrit{Parivāra} is unmistakable.

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr6/en/brahmali}{Pvr~6}, “Offenses in the Chapters”, is a short chapter in verse, stating the number of classes of offenses found in each \textit{khandhaka}. Interestingly, it says that no offenses are laid down in Kd 21. This must mean that the offenses of wrong conduct ascribed to Ānanda at the First Council were not considered offenses proper.\footnote{See \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd21/en/brahmali\#1.10.1}{Kd~21:1.10.1}–1.10.23. } It was presumably understood that the Council elders did not have the authority to lay down new regulations.

\section*{Pvr 7}

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr7/en/brahmali}{Pvr~7}, “The numerical method”, is one of the longest and in some ways the most interesting chapter of the \textsanskrit{Parivāra}. Its structure is almost certainly modeled on the \textsanskrit{Aṅguttara} \textsanskrit{Nikāya}, with each section containing a collection of lists or statements (as opposed to \textit{suttas}) arranged according to the number of items they contain, ranging from one to eleven. And so, there are altogether eleven sections.

Let us consider the nature of these numbered lists. To frame the discussion, I will assume, as discussed above, that much of the purpose of the \textsanskrit{Parivāra} is to educate students. We can then group the lists into three distinct categories, which may be described as follows:

\begin{enumerate}%
\item These lists consist of riddle-like items, presumably to be solved by students of the Vinaya.%
\item Here there is no proper list, but instead a statement declaring that there are x items of a certain kind. Possibly a student was then supposed to elaborate on those items.%
\item These lists simply state what the items are.%
\end{enumerate}

To make it a bit clearer how this works in practice, here is an example of each category:

\begin{enumerate}%
\item “There are offenses one commits at the right time, not at the wrong time. There are offenses one commits at the wrong time, not at the right time. There are offenses one commits both at the right time and also at the wrong time.” (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr7/en/brahmali\#25.4}{Pvr~7:25.4})%
\item “There are three kinds of illegitimate cancellations of the Monastic Code.” (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr7/en/brahmali\#27.1}{Pvr~7:27.1})%
\item “When a monk has three qualities a legal procedure may be done against him: he is shameless, ignorant, and not a regular monk.” (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr7/en/brahmali\#29.3}{Pvr~7:29.3})%
\end{enumerate}

What is interesting about these three categories is that members of the same category tend to appear together in groups. Moreover, these groups do not occur randomly within each section (ones to elevens), but instead in a fairly regular pattern. We can make the following observations:

\begin{itemize}%
\item Category (1)—lists with riddle-like items—always occurs at the beginning, or it does not occur at all. If we assume that this chapter developed over a period of time and that new elements were added at the end of sections, we can say that the earliest version of Pvr 7 consisted of category (1) lists. The riddle-like questions would have ensured a significant involvement from the students.%
\item Category (2) was added next. Here the students are still involved, in the sense of having to recall the individual items. But the involvement is somewhat reduced from the first category, where students need to apply their imagination.%
\item Category (3) is consistently last, with the partial exception of section 5. In this category, the students are merely given a list to be memorized, without any further involvement or testing.%
\item Sections 1 and 5–11 were not part of the earliest version of Pvr 7. It would seem that new sections were added until there was a total of eleven, matching the structure of the \textsanskrit{Aṅguttara} \textsanskrit{Nikāya}.%
\end{itemize}

Given these considerations, it seems possible that the impetus for creating the \textsanskrit{Parivāra}, or at least Pvr 7, may have been the new idea of testing students’ Vinaya knowledge with riddle-like questions. As time went on and the initial impetus faded, new material was added that did not have the same innovative value. These were the category (2) statements. Lastly, we have the category (3) lists, where the students’ involvement is reduced to memorizing the items. As we carry on our investigation of the \textsanskrit{Parivāra}, we shall see that these three categories, especially (1) and (3), are reflected also in other chapters.

Now let us consider the content of these numerical lists. Although I have not attempted any systematic study of this, it seems likely that Pvr 7 is an inventory of all things related to the Vinaya, some of it quite tangential, that can be classified according to a numerical system. This is no doubt one reason why some of the sections are long and repetitive, sometimes even pedantic in their insistence on covering everything at the cost of readability.

Most of the content of Pvr 7 is taken from the first five volumes of the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka}. Occasionally, however, it does include content that is not found anywhere else in the Pali scriptures. For instance, we find a rather quirky paragraph on the five benefits of sweeping (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr7/en/brahmali\#63.58}{Pvr~7:63.58}), and the unexpected list of five gifts without merit (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr7/en/brahmali\#63.54}{Pvr~7:63.54}). Then there is the occasional coinage of new terminology, such as \textit{anusandhivacanapatha}, “the sequence of statements”, which is related to the proper performance of \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghakamma}} (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr7/en/brahmali\#64.16}{Pvr~7:64.16}). Then there are a few lists that are otherwise just found in the Suttas, such as the \textit{\textsanskrit{āghātavatthūni}}, “the ten grounds for resentment” (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr7/en/brahmali\#126.1}{Pvr~7:126.1}). The vast majority of the material, however, is closely tied to the rest of the Vinaya.

\section*{Pvr 8–15}

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr8/en/brahmali}{Pvr~8}, “Aspects of the legal procedures”, describes a number of \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghakammas}} in terms of their beginning, middle, and end. There is nothing new in this short chapter.

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr9/en/brahmali}{Pvr~9}, “The ten reasons for the training rules”, is another short chapter, in this case setting out the ten reasons the Buddha laid down the training rules, the \textit{\textsanskrit{sikkhāpada}}. This chapter shows how these reasons are so closely related that they are essentially one and the same.

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr10/en/brahmali}{Pvr~10}, “Verses on the training rules”, is a collection of 79 verses, beginning with a list of the places where the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} rules were laid down. It then looks at the four kinds of failures and matches them to the different classes of rules. This is followed by a detailed classification of the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} rules, in accordance with their class and whether they are held in common or not between the monks and the nuns. Finally, each class of rule is explained. The chapter ends with a few inspiring verses, including some that are not found anywhere else in the Canonical literature (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr10/en/brahmali\#80.1}{Pvr~10:80.1}).

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr11/en/brahmali}{Pvr~11}, “The four legal issues and their resolution”, is a technical chapter on these topics. It begins with the legal issues, covering their reopening, their causes, offenses committed because of them, and connections between them. The chapter then turns to consider the seven principles for the resolving of legal issues, starting with some connections between them, before moving on to their causes. This is followed by further analyses of the legal issues. Overall, the content is dry and largely rehashes material found in Kd 14.

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr12/en/brahmali}{Pvr~12}, “The verses on how to accuse properly”, is a short chapter on the proper way of accusing another monastic of an offense. This is expanded on in \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr13/en/brahmali}{Pvr~13}, “The process of investigation”, in which the process to be followed by an investigator is set out, focusing on the examination of the accuser and the accused. We then have a short section on the appropriate behavior of the parties to an accusation, before the chapter ends with a description of the dangers in false accusations.

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr14/en/brahmali}{Pvr~14}, “The short chapter on conflict”, continues in much the same vein by setting out the right attitude of an investigator of a conflict. Much of the content, especially the concept of an investigator, adds to what we find in the Khandhakas. By way of illustration, here is an aspect of the duties of an investigator:

\begin{quotation}%
“He should gladden those who are confused, comfort those who are frightened, restrain those who are fierce, and expose those who are impure.” (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr14/en/brahmali\#4.1}{Pvr~14:4.1})

%
\end{quotation}

The theme of conflict is also the topic of \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr15/en/brahmali}{Pvr~15}, “The great chapter on conflict”. As in Pvr 14, the main concern of this chapter is to set out the qualities of one who is involved in settling a conflict. This chapter repeats much of the material of Pvr 13 on the process of investigation.

\section*{Pvr 16}

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr16/en/brahmali}{Pvr~16}, “The robe-making ceremony”, starts with a few useful definitions that clarify what is meant at Kd 7, which contains the main exposition on the robe-making ceremony. Next comes a section that uses the Abhidhamma method of conditionality to show the correct sequence in which the different parts of the robe-making ceremony should be performed. This use of conditionality is almost unique to a Canonical text outside the Abhidhamma.\footnote{There are few references to such conditionality in \textsanskrit{Paṭisambhidāmagga}, a late Abhidhamma-style text of the Khuddaka \textsanskrit{Nikāya}, and in the \textsanskrit{Peṭakopadesa}, a para-Canonical text. The conditionality in question are the 24 conditions spoken of in the summary of conditions at the beginning of the \textsanskrit{Paṭṭhāna}, the last book of the Abhidhamma. } Moreover, it is somewhat discordant that such a practical ceremony should be framed using such abstract terminology. It is hard to discern any real reason for bringing in the Abhidhamma, except perhaps as an attempt to magnify the importance of the \textsanskrit{Parivāra} by associating it with a framework that was gradually gaining in influence and prestige.

Pvr 16 continues with a technical discussion on how the various aspects of the ceremony condition each other, followed by further definitions and explanations of how the ceremony is to be performed. The chapter ends with a discussion on the ending of the robe season.

Before moving on to the next chapter, some versions of the text have the phrase \textit{\textsanskrit{parivāraṁ} \textsanskrit{niṭṭhitaṁ}}, “the \textsanskrit{Parivāra} is finished”.\footnote{This is found in the PTS version and in SRT. } It seems likely that the text at some point ended here.

\section*{Pvr 17}

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr17/en/brahmali}{Pvr~17}, “Ven. \textsanskrit{Upāli} questions the Buddha”, is a longish chapter that collects all the questions of \textsanskrit{Upāli} in one place. As the Sangha’s foremost Vinaya expert, \textsanskrit{Upāli} is known for his regular questioning of the Buddha, as can be seen throughout the Khandhakas.\footnote{Specifically at Kd 9–10, 12, 17, and 19. } This chapter, however, does not simply assemble his existing questions, but adds a large number of its own, mostly presenting a variety of Vinaya material as if it originated through \textsanskrit{Upāli}’s questioning. This chapter, then, is another extensive collection of assorted Vinaya material.

Pvr 17 has fourteen subchapters with the following content:

\begin{itemize}%
\item 1–3 are mostly concerned with monastics with various bad qualities and the consequences this has from a Vinaya perspective, (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr17/en/brahmali\#1.1}{Pvr~17:1.1}–51.1)%
\item 4 sets out various Vinaya-related activities and how these can be done either legitimately or illegitimately, (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr17/en/brahmali\#54.1}{Pvr~17:54.1})%
\item 5 is broadly concerned with accusations and how to deal with them in an appropriate manner, (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr17/en/brahmali\#87.1}{Pvr~17:87.1})%
\item 6 concerns ascetic practices, (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr17/en/brahmali\#126.1}{Pvr~17:126.1})%
\item 7 is a mix of topics, (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr17/en/brahmali\#131.1}{Pvr~17:131.1})%
\item 8 concerns the relationship between monks and nuns, (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr17/en/brahmali\#147.1}{Pvr~17:147.1})%
\item 9 describes what sort of monk should not be appointed to a committee and what sort of monk is considered ignorant, (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr17/en/brahmali\#169.1}{Pvr~17:169.1})\footnote{The committees referred to are those set up to resolve disagreements in the Sangha under the seven principles for settling legal issues, specifically the fifth principle of majority decision, \textit{yebhuyyasika}, see \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd14/en/brahmali\#14.19.1}{Kd~14:14.19.1}. }%
\item 10 describes the sort of monk who is unqualified to resolve legal issues and then discusses schism in the Sangha, (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr17/en/brahmali\#186.1}{Pvr~17:186.1})%
\item 11–13 discuss the karmic consequences for a schismatic and of doing one’s duties for the Sangha in a biased fashion, (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr17/en/brahmali\#201.1}{Pvr~17:201.1}–236.1)%
\item 14 has a variety of topics, but with an emphasis on whom one should pay respect to, (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr17/en/brahmali\#240.1}{Pvr~17:240.1}).%
\end{itemize}

\section*{Pvr 18–21}

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr18/en/brahmali}{Pvr~18}, “The origination of offenses”, is another chapter on the origination of offenses and is closely related to Pvr 3. As I’ve noted above, the origination of offenses has an outsized presence in the \textsanskrit{Parivāra} compared to the rest of the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka}.

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr19/en/brahmali}{Pvr~19}, “Verses on offenses, training rules, and legal procedures”, is a collection of 109 verses focused for the most part on offenses and \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} rules. The verses have a question-and-answer format, some of them presented as Vinaya conundrums similar to what we have seen in Pvr 7. In the last one-and-a-half subchapters, legal procedures are a major topic.

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr20/en/brahmali}{Pvr~20}, the chapter marvelously named “The sudorific verses”—that is, the sweat-inducing verses—consists of a series of 43 cryptic Vinaya questions. Of all the questions in the \textsanskrit{Parivāra}, these are by far the most difficult. Perhaps they functioned as a test for those aiming for the highest distinction in Vinaya scholarship. Here is a sample:

\begin{verse}%
“A monk, by means of begging, builds a hut,\\

Whose site has been approved, which is the right size,\\

where no harm will be done, and which has\\

a space on all sides.\\

How, then, does he commit an offense?” (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr20/en/brahmali\#8.1}{Pvr~20:8.1})

%
\end{verse}

Although this question is framed in terms of Bu Ss 6, the answer, says the commentary, is found in the origin story to Bu Pj 2, in which there is an offense of wrong conduct for building a hut made entirely of clay \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2/en/brahmali\#1.2.11}{Bu~Pj~2}.

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr21/en/brahmali}{Pvr~21}, “Legal procedures, why the Monastic Law, resolution of legal issues”, begins with a summary of the five ways in which legal procedures fail. This is followed by three subchapters on the reasons why the Buddha laid down the training rules and other Vinaya procedures. The final subchapter is about the resolution of legal issues.

\thematicbreak
The above is no more than a brief overview of the content of the \textsanskrit{Parivāra}. There are number of issues that deserve further attention, but that will have to wait for another time. Apart from those mentioned in the text above, here is a short list of such issues:

\begin{itemize}%
\item It would be helpful to study the non-Vinaya content of the \textsanskrit{Parivāra}, such as the \textit{cha \textsanskrit{sāraṇīyā} \textsanskrit{dhammā}}, “the six aspects of friendliness”.\footnote{At \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr7/en/brahmali\#81.19}{Pvr~7:81.19}. } This would aid our understanding of how this collection evolved.%
\item Occasionally the \textsanskrit{Parivāra} contradicts the content of the other parts of the Vinaya, such as stating that a nun with ten years’ seniority may give the full ordination.\footnote{At \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr7/en/brahmali\#135.26}{Pvr~7:135.26}. } Such contradictions seem too blatant to have happened by accident. So, why are they there?%
\item The \textsanskrit{Parivāra} sometimes includes rules not found anywhere else in the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka}. For instance, there is the following rule for nuns: “When, being unsure, she conceals [an offense], she commits a serious offense.”\footnote{At \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr2.2/en/brahmali\#2.4}{Pvr~2.2:2.4}. } Where do such rules come from?%
\item We find occasional differences in vocabulary and spelling between the \textsanskrit{Parivāra} and the earlier books of the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka}. One such instance is \textit{\textsanskrit{samādisati}} in the Sutta-\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga}, whereas the equivalent in the \textsanskrit{Parivāra} is \textit{\textsanskrit{saṁvidahitvā}} instead.\footnote{Respectively at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6/en/brahmali\#3.5.1}{Bu~Ss~6:3.5.1} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr4/en/brahmali\#42.3}{Pvr~4:42.3}. } A systematic survey of such differences, with a discussion of their origins, would be helpful.%
\item All seven books of the Abhidhamma are mentioned in the \textsanskrit{Parivāra}.\footnote{At \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr1.1/en/brahmali\#7.2}{Pvr~1.1:7.2}. } Such details are helpful to help us establish the relative chronology of the Canonical texts.%

\section*{The chapter on offenses entailing expulsion }

\scnamo{Homage to the Buddha, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One }

“The\marginnote{2.1} first offense entailing expulsion was laid down by the Buddha who knows and sees, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One. Where was it laid down? Whom is it about? What is it about? Is there a rule, an addition to the rule, an unprompted rule?\footnote{Sp 5.2: \textit{\textsanskrit{Ayañhi} \textsanskrit{anuppannapaññatti} \textsanskrit{nāma} anuppanne dose \textsanskrit{paññattā}; \textsanskrit{sā} \textsanskrit{aṭṭhagarudhammavasena} \textsanskrit{bhikkhunīnaṁyeva} \textsanskrit{āgatā}, \textsanskrit{aññatra} natthi}, “Laid down when no fault has occurred, this is called \textit{\textsanskrit{anuppannapaññatti}}. It has come down for the nuns on account of the eight important principles. There are no other cases.” } Is it a rule that applies everywhere or in a particular place? Is it a rule that the monks and nuns have in common or not in common? Is it a rule for one Sangha or for both? In which of the five ways of reciting the Monastic Code is it contained and included? In which recitation is it included? To which of the four kinds of failure does it belong? To which of the seven classes of offenses does it belong? Through how many of the six kinds of originations of offenses does it originate? To which of the four kinds of legal issues does it belong? Through how many of the seven principles for settling legal issues is it settled? What is the Monastic Law there? What is concerned with the Monastic Law there? What is the Monastic Code there? What is concerned with the Monastic Code there? What is failure? What is success? What is the practice? For how many reasons did the Buddha lay down the first offense entailing expulsion? Who are those who train? Who have finished the training? Established in what? Who master it? Whose pronouncement was it? Who handed it down?” 

“The\marginnote{3.1} first offense entailing expulsion was laid down by the Buddha who knows and sees, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One. Where was it laid down?” At \textsanskrit{Vesālī}. “Whom is it about?” Sudinna the Kalandian. “What is it about?” Sudinna having sexual intercourse with his ex-wife. “Is there a rule, an addition to the rule, an unprompted rule?” There is one rule. There are two additions to the rule.\footnote{Sp 5.2: \textit{Dve \textsanskrit{anupaññattiyoti} “antamaso \textsanskrit{tiracchānagatāyapī}”ti ca, “\textsanskrit{sikkhaṁ} \textsanskrit{apaccakkhāyā}”ti ca \textsanskrit{makkaṭivajjiputtakavatthūnaṁ} vasena \textsanskrit{vuttā} – \textsanskrit{imā} dve \textsanskrit{anupaññattiyo}}, “Two \textit{\textsanskrit{anupaññattiyo}} is said because of the accounts of the female monkey and the Vajjians. These are the two additions to the rule: ‘even with a female animal’ and ‘without first renouncing the training’.” } There is no unprompted rule. “Is it a rule that applies everywhere or in a particular place?” Everywhere.\footnote{Sp 5.2: \textit{\textsanskrit{Sabbatthapaññattīti} majjhimadese ceva paccantimajanapadesu ca \textsanskrit{sabbatthapaññatti}}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Sabbatthapaññatti}}: both in the central Ganges plain and in the outlying countries, this is \textit{\textsanskrit{sabbatthapaññatti}}.” } “Is it a rule that the monks and nuns have in common or not in common?” In common. “Is it a rule for one Sangha or for both?” For both.\footnote{Sp 5.2: \textit{\textsanskrit{Byañjanamattameva} hi ettha \textsanskrit{nānaṁ}, \textsanskrit{bhikkhūnaṁ} \textsanskrit{bhikkhunīnampi} \textsanskrit{sādhāraṇattā} \textsanskrit{sādhāraṇapaññatti}, ubhinnampi \textsanskrit{paññattattā} \textsanskrit{ubhatopaññattīti}}, “For here merely the wording is different, since a commonality between the monks and the nuns is a common rule, whereas a ruling for both is a rule for both sides.” The point seems to be that a rule “in common” is synonymous with a rule “for both”. } “In which of the five ways of reciting the Monastic Code is it contained and included?” In the introduction.\footnote{Sp 5.2: \textit{\textsanskrit{Nidānogadhanti} “yassa \textsanskrit{siyā} \textsanskrit{āpatti} so \textsanskrit{āvikareyyā}”ti ettha \textsanskrit{sabbāpattīnaṁ} \textsanskrit{anupaviṭṭhattā} \textsanskrit{nidānogadhaṁ}; \textsanskrit{nidāne} \textsanskrit{anupaviṭṭhanti} attho}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Nidānogadha}}: it is contained in the introduction because of the entry here of all offenses: ‘Anyone who has committed an offense should reveal it.’ The meaning is they are entered in the introduction.” } “In which recitation is it included?” In the second recitation.\footnote{Sp 5.2: \textit{Dutiyena \textsanskrit{uddesenāti} \textsanskrit{nidānogadhaṁ} \textsanskrit{nidānapariyāpannampi} \textsanskrit{samānaṁ} “tatrime \textsanskrit{cattāro} \textsanskrit{pārājikā} \textsanskrit{dhammā}”\textsanskrit{tiādinā} dutiyeneva uddesena \textsanskrit{uddesaṁ} \textsanskrit{āgacchati}}, “In the second recitation: being contained and included in the introduction, it comes to be recited with ‘Now these four rules on expulsion’ etc.” } “To which of the four kinds of failure does it belong?” Failure in morality. “To which of the seven classes of offenses does it belong?” The class of offenses entailing expulsion. “Through how many of the six kinds of originations of offenses does it originate?” It originates in one way: from body and mind, not from speech. “To which of the four kinds of legal issues does it belong?” Legal issues arising from an offense. “Through how many of the seven principles for settling legal issues is it settled?” Through two of them: by resolution face-to-face and by acting according to what has been admitted. “What is the Monastic Law there? What is concerned with the Monastic Law there?” The rule is the Monastic Law. Its analysis is concerned with the Monastic Law.\footnote{Sp 5.2: \textit{\textsanskrit{Vibhattīti} \textsanskrit{padabhājanaṁ} vuccati; \textsanskrit{vibhattīti} hi \textsanskrit{vibhaṅgassevetaṁ} \textsanskrit{nāmaṁ}}, “The word analysis is called \textit{vibhatti}; for \textit{vibhatti} is a name for the analysis.” The first of these refers to the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha}, which is mentioned in the next entry, whereas the latter refers to the \textit{\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga}}. This shows us that the prefix \textit{abhi-} means “about” in certain contexts, such as this one, and refers to a commentary style text. It may well be, then, that the Abhidhamma, which is sometimes paired with \textit{abhivinaya} in the Canonical texts, originally was regarded as a commentary on the content of the Sutta \textsanskrit{Piṭaka}. } “What is the Monastic Code there? What is concerned with the Monastic Code there?” The rule is the Monastic Code. Its analysis is concerned with the Monastic Code. “What is failure?” Lack of restraint. “What is success?” Restraint. “What is the practice?” Thinking, “I won’t do such a thing,” one undertakes to train in the training rules for life. “For how many reasons did the Buddha lay down the first offense entailing expulsion?” He laid it down for the following ten reasons: for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad people, for the ease of good monks, for the restraint of the corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of the corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training. “Who are those who train?” They are the trainees and the good ordinary people. “Who have finished the training?” The perfected ones. “Established in what?” In fondness for the training. “Who master it?” Those who learn it.\footnote{Sp 5.2: \textit{\textsanskrit{Yesaṁ} \textsanskrit{vattatīti} \textsanskrit{yesaṁ} \textsanskrit{vinayapiṭakañca} \textsanskrit{aṭṭhakathā} ca \textsanskrit{sabbā} \textsanskrit{paguṇāti} attho}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Yesaṁ} vattati} means for those who learn the whole collection of Monastic Law and the commentaries.” } “Whose pronouncement was it?” It was the pronouncement of the Buddha, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One. “Who handed it down?” The lineage:

“The\marginnote{20.1} second offense entailing expulsion was laid down by the Buddha who knows and sees, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One.

There is one addition to the rule. “Through how many of the six kinds of originations of offenses does it originate?” It originates in three ways: from body and mind, not from speech; or from speech and mind, not from body; or from body, speech, and mind. … 

“There\marginnote{21.1} is the third offense entailing expulsion.

\section*{2. The chapter on offenses entailing suspension }

“The\marginnote{26.1} offense entailing suspension for emitting semen by means of effort was laid down by the Buddha who knows and sees, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One. Where was it laid down? Whom is it about? What is it about? Is there a rule, an addition to the rule, an unprompted rule? Is it a rule that applies everywhere or in a particular place?

Who master it? Whose pronouncement was it? Who handed it down?” 

“The\marginnote{27.1} offense entailing suspension for emitting semen by means of effort was laid down by the Buddha who knows and sees, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One. Where was it laid down?” At \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. “Whom is it about?” Venerable Seyyasaka. “What is it about?” Seyyasaka masturbating. “Is there a rule, an addition to the rule, an unprompted rule?” There is one rule. There is one addition to the rule.

\section*{Summary of originations }

\begin{verse}%
“All\marginnote{1.1} phenomena are impermanent, \\
And suffering, nonself, made up; \\
Indeed the description extinguishment, \\
Is the conviction about nonself. 

When\marginnote{2.1} the Buddha moon has not appeared, \\
When the Buddha sun has not yet risen; \\
Then even the name is not known, \\
Of the things that are the same as those.\footnote{This renders \textit{\textsanskrit{tesaṁ} \textsanskrit{sabhāgadhammānaṁ}}. The point seems to be that the names \textit{anicca}, etc., mentioned above, are not even known if a Buddha does not arise. } 

Having\marginnote{3.1} done many difficult things, \\
Having fulfilled the perfections; \\
The Great Heroes emerge, \\
Endowed with vision, in this world with its supreme beings.\footnote{Reading \textit{sabrahmake} as a shorthand for \textit{sabrahmake loke}. } 

They\marginnote{4.1} instruct in the True Teaching, \\
That ends suffering and brings happiness; \\
\textsanskrit{Angīrasa}, the Sakyan Sage, \\
Who has compassion for all beings. 

The\marginnote{5.1} best of all creatures, the lion, \\
Taught the three Collections: \\
The Discourses, and the Philosophy, \\
And the Monastic Law, of great quality. 

Thus\marginnote{6.1} the true Teaching carries on, \\
So long as the Monastic Law remains; \\
As well as both Analyses, \\
The Chapters, and the Key Terms—

A\marginnote{7.1} garland bound, \\
By the quality of the string of the Compendium; \\
In this very Compendium, \\
Originations are determined. 

Combination\marginnote{8.1} and source are another, \\
Which are pointed out in the list below. \\
Therefore, they should train in the Compendium, \\
Those who love the Teaching and are highly virtuous.”

\section*{The thirteen originations }

In this way that bad root of accusations has no future effect. 

What\marginnote{18.1} are the six aspects of friendliness? (1) As to this, a monk acts with good will toward his fellow monastics, both in public and in private. (2) Furthermore, a monk speaks with good will to his fellow monastics, both in public and in private. (3) Furthermore, a monk thinks with good will about his fellow monastics, both in public and in private. (4) Furthermore, whatever a monk has gained in an appropriate manner, even the content of his almsbowl, he shares without reservation with his virtuous fellow monastics. (5) Furthermore, a monk lives with his fellow monastics, both in public and in private, with moral conduct that is unbroken, consistent, spotless, pure, liberating, praised by the wise, ungrasped, and leading to stillness. (6) Furthermore, a monk lives with his fellow monastics, both in public and in private, with that noble view that is liberating and leads one who acts in accordance with it to the complete end of suffering. These aspects of friendliness create love and respect, and lead to coming together, concord, harmony, and unity.

He proclaims what hasn’t been spoken by the Buddha as spoken by him, and what has been spoken by the Buddha as not spoken by him. He proclaims what was not practiced by the Buddha as practiced by him, and what was practiced by the Buddha as not practiced by him. He proclaims what was not laid down by the Buddha as laid down by him, and what was laid down by the Buddha as not laid down by him. He proclaims a non-offense as an offense, and an offense as a non-offense. He proclaims a light offense as heavy, and a heavy offense as light.

Through how many of the six kinds of originations of offenses do they originate? To which of the four kinds of legal issues do they belong? Through how many of the seven principles for settling legal issues are they settled? They belong to two kinds of failure: they may be failure in morality; they may be failure in conduct. They are found in six classes of offenses: they may be in the class of offenses entailing expulsion; they may be in the class of offenses entailing suspension; they may be in the class of serious offenses; they may be in the class of offenses entailing confession; they may be in the class of offenses entailing acknowledgment; they may be in the class of offenses of wrong conduct.

“Are\marginnote{92.1} ‘legal issue’ and ‘principle for settling’ connected or disconnected? Is it possible to completely separate them and point to their difference?” 

“‘Legal\marginnote{93.1} issue’ and ‘principle for settling’ are disconnected, not connected, and it’s possible to completely separate them and point to their difference”: they should be told not to say this. “‘Legal issue’ and ‘principle for settling’ are connected, not disconnected, and it’s impossible to completely separate them and point to their difference. Why’s that? Didn’t the Buddha say that there are four kinds of legal issues and seven principles for settling? Legal issues are settled through the principles for settling; the principles for settling are settled through legal issues.\footnote{The latter of these two is explained at Vmv 5.306: \textit{\textsanskrit{Samathāadhikaraṇehi} \textsanskrit{sammantīti} \textsanskrit{apalokanādīhi} \textsanskrit{catūhi} \textsanskrit{kiccādhikaraṇehi} sabbepi \textsanskrit{samathā} \textsanskrit{niṭṭhānaṁ} gacchanti, \textsanskrit{nāññehīti} \textsanskrit{imamatthaṁ} \textsanskrit{sandhāya} \textsanskrit{vuttaṁ}}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Samathāadhikaraṇehi} sammanti}: with the four legal issues arising from business, starting with the legal procedure of getting permission, all principles for settling, too, come to an end, but not with any other legal issue. It was said with reference to this.” } In this way they are connected, not disconnected, and it’s impossible to completely separate them and point to their difference.”

A\marginnote{149.1} legal issue arising from business is not settled through a legal issue arising from a dispute, through a legal issue arising from an accusation, or through a legal issue arising from an offense. It is settled through a legal issue arising from business. 

The\marginnote{150.1} six principles for settling and the four legal issues are settled through resolution face-to-face. Resolution face-to-face is not settled through anything. 

\scendsutta{The nineteenth section on principles for settling and legal issues is finished. }

\section*{15. The section on causing to originate }

Which\marginnote{152.1} of the four legal issues causes a legal issue arising from a dispute to originate? None of them. Nevertheless, the four legal issues are produced from a legal issue arising from a dispute. How is that? It may be that monks are disputing, saying, “This is the Teaching”, “This is contrary to the Teaching”, “This is the Monastic Law”, “This is contrary to the Monastic Law”, “This was spoken by the Buddha”, “This was not spoken by the Buddha”, “This was practiced by the Buddha”, “This was not practiced by the Buddha”, “This was laid down by the Buddha”, “This was not laid down by the Buddha”, “This is an offense”, “This is not an offense”, “This is a light offense”, “This is a heavy offense”, “This is a curable offense”, “This is an incurable offense”, “This is a grave offense”, or “This is a minor offense.” In regard to this, whatever there is of quarreling, arguing, conflict, disputing, variety in opinion, difference in opinion, heated speech, or strife—this is called a legal issue arising from a dispute. When, during a legal issue arising from a dispute, the Sangha disputes, there is a legal issue arising from a dispute.\footnote{The punctuation of the Pali in this and the next two segments does not seem right. The purpose of this and the next three sentences is to answer the question posed just above about how the four legal issues are produced from a legal issue arising from a dispute. For this to work, I propose the following punctuation: \textit{\textsanskrit{Vivādādhikaraṇe} \textsanskrit{saṅgho} vivadati \textsanskrit{vivādādhikaraṇaṁ}. \textsanskrit{Vivadamāno} anuvadati \textsanskrit{anuvādādhikaraṇaṁ}. \textsanskrit{Anuvadamāno} \textsanskrit{āpattiṁ} \textsanskrit{āpajjati} \textsanskrit{āpattādhikaraṇaṁ}. \textsanskrit{Tāya} \textsanskrit{āpattiyā} \textsanskrit{saṅgho} \textsanskrit{kammaṁ} karoti \textsanskrit{kiccādhikaraṇaṁ}.} This suggestion is supported by the punctuation found in the parallel passage at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-pvr11/en/brahmali\#32.9}{Pvr 11:32.9}–32.11. I translate accordingly. And also below for the other three kinds of legal issues. } When one who is disputing makes an accusation, there is a legal issue arising from an accusation. When one who is accusing commits an offense, there is a legal issue arising from an offense. When the Sangha does a legal procedure because of that offense, there is a legal issue arising from business. 

Which\marginnote{153.1} of the four legal issues causes a legal issue arising from an accusation to originate? None of them. Nevertheless, the four legal issues are produced from a legal issue arising from an accusation. How is that? It may be that the monks accuse a monk of failure in morality, failure in conduct, failure in view, or failure in livelihood. In regard to this, whatever there is of accusations, accusing, allegations, blame, taking sides because of friendship, taking part in the accusation, or supporting the accusation—this is called a legal issue arising from an accusation. When, during a legal issue arising from an accusation, the Sangha disputes, there is a legal issue arising from a dispute. When one who is disputing makes an accusation, there is a legal issue arising from an accusation. When one who is accusing commits an offense, there is a legal issue arising from an offense. When the Sangha does a legal procedure because of that offense, there is a legal issue arising from business. 

Which\marginnote{154.1} of the four legal issues causes a legal issue arising from an offense to originate? None of them. Nevertheless, the four legal issues are produced from a legal issue arising from an offense. How is that? There are legal issues arising from offenses because of the five classes of offenses, and there are legal issues arising from offenses because of the seven classes of offenses—these are called legal issues arising from offenses. When, during a legal issue arising from an offense, the Sangha disputes, there is a legal issue arising from a dispute. When one who is disputing makes an accusation, there is a legal issue arising from an accusation. When one who is accusing commits an offense, there is a legal issue arising from an offense. When the Sangha does a legal procedure because of that offense, there is a legal issue arising from business. 

Which\marginnote{155.1} of the four legal issues causes a legal issue arising from business to originate? None of them. Nevertheless, the four legal issues are produced from a legal issue arising from business. How is that? Whatever is the duty or the business of the Sangha—a legal procedure consisting of getting permission, a legal procedure consisting of one motion, a legal procedure consisting of one motion and one announcement, a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements—this is called a legal issue arising from business. When, during a legal issue arising from business, the Sangha disputes, there is a legal issue arising from a dispute. When one who is disputing makes an accusation, there is a legal issue arising from an accusation. When one who is accusing commits an offense, there is a legal issue arising from an offense. When the Sangha does a legal procedure because of that offense, there is a legal issue arising from business.

\section*{1. Training rules laid down in seven towns }

\begin{verse}%
“Arranging\marginnote{1.1} your robe over one shoulder, \\
Raising your joined palms—\\
What are you hoping for, \\
That you have come here?” 

“What\marginnote{2.1} has been laid down in the two Monastic Laws, \\
Which come up for recitation on the observance days—\\
How many training rules do they have? \\
In how many towns were they laid down?” 

“Your\marginnote{3.1} approach is excellent, \\
You question sensibly; \\
And so I will tell you, \\
According to your skill.\footnote{The end quote in the Pali seems to be a mistake. } 

What\marginnote{4.1} has been laid down in the two Monastic Laws, \\
Which come up for recitation on the observance days—\\
They are three hundred and fifty,\footnote{This number seems to be the sum of all the rules in both Monastic Codes, with the rules in common between the nuns and the monks only counted once. Also, the seven principles for the settling of legal issues are not counted. } \\
Laid down in seven towns.” 

“In\marginnote{5.1} which seven towns were they laid down? \\
Please tell me this; \\
And after attending carefully to your explanation, \\
We will practice for our own benefit.”

\section*{2. The four kinds of failure }

\begin{verse}%
“What\marginnote{27.1} we have asked, you have answered, \\
All is explained, not otherwise; \\
I wish to ask you another question—please tell me this: \\
Serious, and light, curable; \\
Incurable, and grave, minor, \\
And those that are ‘after the third’. 

In\marginnote{28.1} common, not in common, \\
The ways that failures are settled—\footnote{Reading \textit{vipattiyo} with the PTS edition in place of \textit{vibhattiyo}. } \\
Please explain all these too, \\
And we will listen to you.” 

“There\marginnote{29.1} are thirty-one serious ones, \\
And eight here are incurable; \\
Those that are serious are grave, \\
Those that are grave are failures in morality; \\
Offenses entailing expulsion, offenses entailing suspension—\\
They are called ‘failure in morality’. 

Serious\marginnote{30.1} offenses, offenses entailing confession, \\
Offenses entailing acknowledgment, offenses of wrong conduct; \\
Offenses of wrong speech, \\
And whoever calls another names for fun—\\
This is considered failure in conduct. 

Holding\marginnote{31.1} on to distorted views, \\
Preferring what is contrary to the true Dhamma; \\
Misrepresenting the Awakened One, \\
Being foolish, enveloped in delusion—\\
This is considered failure in view. 

%
\end{verse}

When,\marginnote{32.1} to make a living—having bad desires, overcome by desire—one claims to have a non-existent superhuman quality; when, to make a living, one acts as a matchmaker; when, to make a living, one says, ‘The monk who stays in your dwelling is a perfected one;’ when, to make a living, a monk eats fine foods that he has requested for himself; when, to make a living, a nun eats fine foods that she herself has asked for; when, to make a living, one eats bean curry or rice that one has requested for oneself—this is considered failure in livelihood. 

\begin{verse}%
There\marginnote{33.1} are eleven ‘after the thirds’, \\
Listen to them as they truly are: \\
A nun who takes sides with one who has been ejected,\footnote{\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj7/en/brahmali\#1.11.1}{Bi Pj 7:1.11.1}. } \\
Eight ‘after the thirds’;\footnote{\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10/en/brahmali\#1.3.16.1}{Bu Ss 10:1.3.16.1}–13 and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss10/en/brahmali\#1.19.1}{Bi Ss 10:1.19.1}–13. } \\

It is called, ‘An undetermined offense’. 

It\marginnote{66.1} is said, ‘A serious offense’. \\
Listen to it as it truly is: \\
The one who confesses to instigating another, \\
And the one who agrees to it—\\
There is no offense like that.\footnote{Sp 5.339: \textit{\textsanskrit{Catutthagāthāya} accayo tena samo \textsanskrit{natthīti} \textsanskrit{desanāgāminīsu} accayesu tena samo \textsanskrit{thūlo} accayo natthi}, “In the fourth verse, ‘There is no offense like that,’ means that in regard to the offenses that are to be confessed, there is no gross offense that is equivalent to that.” } \\

\section*{1. The subdivision on reopening, etc. }

There\marginnote{1.1} are four kinds of legal issues: legal issues arising from disputes, legal issues arising from accusations, legal issues arising from offenses, legal issues arising from business. 

How\marginnote{2.1} many kinds of reopening are there of these four legal issues? Ten. There are two kinds of reopening of legal issues arising from disputes, four of legal issues arising from accusations, three of legal issues arising from offenses, and one of legal issues arising from business. 

When\marginnote{3.1} reopening a legal issue arising from a dispute, how many of the principles for settling it does one reopen? When reopening a legal issue arising from an accusation, how many of the principles for settling it does one reopen? When reopening a legal issue arising from an offense, how many of the principles for settling it does one reopen? When reopening a legal issue arising from business, how many of the principles for settling it does one reopen? 

When\marginnote{4.1} reopening a legal issue arising from a dispute, one reopens two principles for settling it. When reopening a legal issue arising from an accusation, one reopens four principles for settling it. When reopening a legal issue arising from an offense, one reopens three principles for settling it. When reopening a legal issue arising from business, one reopens one principle for settling it. 

How\marginnote{5.1} many kinds of reopening are there? In how many ways does a reopening come about? How many attributes do people who reopen legal issues have? How many kinds of people commit an offense when they reopen a legal issue? 

There\marginnote{6.1} are twelve kinds of reopening. A reopening comes about in ten ways. People who reopen legal issues have four attributes. There are four kinds of people who commit an offense when they reopen legal issues. 

What\marginnote{7.1} are the twelve kinds of reopening? “The legal procedure hasn’t been done”; “it’s been done badly”; “it should be done again”; “it’s not been settled”; “it’s been badly settled”; “it should be settled again”; “it’s not been decided”; “it’s been badly decided”; “it should be decided again”; “it’s not been disposed of”; “it’s been badly disposed of”; “it should be disposed of again”. 

What\marginnote{8.1} are the ten ways that a reopening comes about? One reopens a legal issue where it arose; one reopens a legal issue where it arose and was resolved; one reopens a legal issue while traveling; one reopens a legal issue that was resolved while traveling; one reopens a legal issue after going there; one reopens a legal issue that was resolved after going there; one reopens a resolution through recollection; one reopens a resolution because of past insanity; one reopens a decision on giving a further penalty; one reopens a decision on covering over as if with grass. 

What\marginnote{9.1} are the four attributes of people who reopen legal issues? They reopen legal issues biased by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear. 

Who\marginnote{10.1} are the four kinds of people who commit an offense when they reopen a legal issue? If one who was ordained on that very day does the reopening, they commit an offense entailing confession; if one who has newly arrived does the reopening, they commit an offense entailing confession; if the original doer does the reopening, they commit an offense entailing confession; if one who had given their consent does the reopening, they commit an offense entailing confession.\footnote{Sp 5.341: \textit{\textsanskrit{Kārakoti} \textsanskrit{ekaṁ} \textsanskrit{saṅghena} \textsanskrit{saddhiṁ} \textsanskrit{adhikaraṇaṁ} \textsanskrit{vinicchinitvā} \textsanskrit{pariveṇagataṁ} \textsanskrit{parājitā} \textsanskrit{bhikkhū} vadanti “kissa, bhante, tumhehi \textsanskrit{evaṁ} \textsanskrit{vinicchitaṁ} \textsanskrit{adhikaraṇaṁ}, nanu \textsanskrit{evaṁ} vinicchinitabba”nti.

Should it not be decided in this way?’ Saying, ‘Why did you not say this straightaway?’ he reopens that legal issue. In this way, the original doer reopens it.” } 

\section*{2. The sources of the legal issues, etc. }

What\marginnote{11.1} is the source, the origin, the birth, the arising, the production, the origination of legal issues arising from disputes? What is the source, the origin, the birth, the arising, the production, the origination of legal issues arising from accusations? What is the source, the origin, the birth, the arising, the production, the origination of legal issues arising from offenses? What is the source, the origin, the birth, the arising, the production, the origination of legal issues arising from business? 

Legal\marginnote{12.1} issues arising from disputes have disputes as their source, their origin, their birth, their arising, their production, their origination. Legal issues arising from accusations have accusations as their source, their origin, their birth, their arising, their production, their origination. Legal issues arising from offenses have offenses as their source, their origin, their birth, their arising, their production, their origination. Legal issues arising from business have business as their source, their origin, their birth, their arising, their production, their origination. 

What\marginnote{13.1} is the source, the origin, the birth, the arising, the production, the origination of legal issues arising from disputes? … of legal issues arising from accusations? … of legal issues arising from offenses? … of legal issues arising from business? 

Legal\marginnote{14.1} issues arising from disputes have causes as their source, their origin, their birth, their arising, their production, their origination.\footnote{Sp 5.342: \textit{\textsanskrit{Dutiyapucchāya} \textsanskrit{hetunidānantiādimhi} vissajjane \textsanskrit{navannaṁ} \textsanskrit{kusalākusalābyākatahetūnaṁ} vasena \textsanskrit{hetunidānāditā} \textsanskrit{veditabbā}}, “In the second question, in ‘causes as their source, etc.’: in the reply, causes as their source, etc., is to be understood on account of the nine wholesome, unwholesome, and indeterminate causes.” } Legal issues arising from accusations … Legal issues arising from offenses … Legal issues arising from business have causes as their source, their origin, their birth, their arising, their production, their origination. 

What\marginnote{15.1} is the source, the origin, the birth, the arising, the production, the origination of legal issues arising from disputes? … of legal issues arising from accusations? … of legal issues arising from offenses? … of legal issues arising from business? 

Legal\marginnote{16.1} issues arising from disputes have conditions as their source, their origin, their birth, their arising, their production, their origination. Legal issues arising from accusations … Legal issues arising from offenses … Legal issues arising from business have conditions as their source, their origin, their birth, their arising, their production, their origination. 

\section*{3. The roots of legal issues, etc. }

How\marginnote{17.1} many roots do the four kinds of legal issues have, and how many originations? They have thirty-three roots, and thirty-three originations. 

What\marginnote{18.1} are the thirty-three roots? Legal issues arising from disputes have twelve roots; legal issues arising from accusations have fourteen roots; legal issues arising from offenses have six roots; legal issues arising from business have one root, the Sangha. 

What\marginnote{19.1} are the thirty-three originations? Legal issues arising from disputes originate from the eighteen grounds for schism; legal issues arising from accusations originate from the four kinds of failure; legal issues arising from offenses originate from the seven classes of offenses; legal issues arising from business originate from the four kinds of legal procedures. 

\section*{4. Offenses because of legal issues }

“Is\marginnote{20.1} a legal issue arising from a dispute an offense or not an offense?” It is not an offense. “Is it possible to commit an offense because of a legal issue arising from a dispute?” Yes. How many offenses does one commit because of legal issues arising from disputes? Two: there is an offense entailing confession for abusing one who is fully ordained; there is an offense of wrong conduct for abusing one who is not fully ordained. 

When\marginnote{21.1} it comes to these offenses, to how many of the four kinds of failure do they belong? To which of the four kinds of legal issues do they belong? In how many of the seven classes of offenses are they found? Through how many of the six kinds of originations of offenses do they originate? Through how many kinds of legal issues, in how many places, and through how many of the principles for settling legal issues are they settled? 

They\marginnote{22.1} belong to one kind of failure: failure in conduct. They belong to legal issues arising from an offense. They are found in two classes of offenses: they may be in the class of offenses entailing confession; they may be in the class of offenses of wrong conduct. They originate in three ways. They are settled through one kind of legal issue: a legal issue arising from business. They are settled in three places: in the midst of the Sangha, in the midst of a group, or in the presence of an individual. They are settled through three principles: they may be settled by resolution face-to-face and by acting according to what has been admitted; or they may be settled by resolution face-to-face and by covering over as if with grass. 

“Is\marginnote{23.1} a legal issue arising from an accusation an offense or not an offense?” It is not an offense. “Is it possible to commit an offense because of a legal issue arising from an accusation?” Yes. How many offenses does one commit because of legal issues arising from accusations? Three: there is an offense entailing suspension for groundlessly charging a monk with an offense entailing expulsion; there is an offense entailing confession for groundlessly charging someone with an offense entailing suspension; there is an offense of wrong conduct for groundlessly charging someone with failure in conduct. 

When\marginnote{24.1} it comes to these offenses, to how many of the four kinds of failure do they belong? To which of the four kinds of legal issues do they belong? In how many of the seven classes of offenses are they found? Through how many of the six kinds of originations of offenses do they originate? Through how many kinds of legal issues, in how many places, and through how many of the principles for settling legal issues are they settled? 

They\marginnote{25.1} belong to two kinds of failure: they may be failure in morality; they may be failure in conduct. They belong to legal issues arising from an offense. They are found in three classes of offenses: they may be in the class of offenses entailing suspension; they may be in the class of offenses entailing confession; they may be in the class of offenses of wrong conduct. They originate in three ways. The heavy offenses are settled through one kind of legal issue: a legal issue arising from business. They are settled in one place: in the midst of the Sangha. They are settled through two principles: by resolution face-to-face and by acting according to what has been admitted. The light offenses are settled through one kind of legal issue: a legal issue arising from business. They are settled in three places: in the midst of the Sangha, in the midst of a group, or in the presence of an individual. They are settled through three principles: they may be settled by resolution face-to-face and by acting according to what has been admitted; or they may be settled by resolution face-to-face and by covering over as if with grass. 

“Is\marginnote{26.1} a legal issue arising from an offense an offense or not an offense?” It is an offense. “Is it possible to commit an offense because of a legal issue arising from an offense?” Yes. How many offenses does one commit because of legal issues arising from offenses? Four: there is an offense entailing expulsion for a nun who knowingly conceals an offense entailing expulsion; there is a serious offense for concealing it if she is unsure; there is an offense entailing confession for a monk who conceals an offense entailing suspension; there is an offense of wrong conduct for concealing a failure in conduct. 

When\marginnote{27.1} it comes to these offenses, to how many of the four kinds of failure do they belong? To which of the four kinds of legal issues do they belong? In how many of the seven classes of offenses are they found? Through how many of the six kinds of originations of offenses do they originate? Through how many kinds of legal issues, in how many places, and through how many of the principles for settling legal issues are they settled? 

They\marginnote{28.1} belong to two kinds of failure: they may be failure in morality; they may be failure in conduct. They belong to legal issues arising from an offense. They are found in four classes of offenses: they may be in the class of offenses entailing expulsion; they may be in the class of serious offenses; they may be in the class of offenses entailing confession; they may be in the class of offenses of wrong conduct. They originate in one way: from body, speech, and mind. The incurable offense is not settled through any kind of legal issue, in any place, or through any of the principles for settling legal issues.\footnote{That is, the offense entailing expulsion. } The light offenses are settled through one kind of legal issue: a legal issue arising from business. They are settled in three places: in the midst of the Sangha, in the midst of a group, or in the presence of an individual. They are settled through three principles: they may be settled by resolution face-to-face and by acting according to what has been admitted; or they may be settled by resolution face-to-face and by covering over as if with grass. 

“Is\marginnote{29.1} a legal issue arising from business an offense or not an offense?” It is not an offense. “Is it possible to commit an offense because of a legal issue arising from business?” Yes. How many offenses does one commit because of legal issues arising from business? Five: there is an offense of wrong conduct after the motion when a nun takes sides with one who has been ejected and does not stop when pressed up to three times; there is a serious offense after each of the first two announcements; there is an offense entailing expulsion when the last announcement is finished; there is an offense entailing suspension when monks who side with a monk who is pursuing schism do not stop when pressed for the third time; there is an offense entailing confession when not giving up a bad view after being pressed for the third time. 

When\marginnote{30.1} it comes to these offenses, to how many of the four kinds of failure do they belong? To which of the four kinds of legal issues do they belong? In how many of the seven classes of offenses are they found? Through how many of the six kinds of originations of offenses do they originate? Through how many kinds of legal issues, in how many places, and through how many of the principles for settling legal issues are they settled? 

They\marginnote{31.1} belong to two kinds of failure: they may be failure in morality; they may be failure in conduct. They belong to legal issues arising from an offense. They are found in five classes of offenses: they may be in the class of offenses entailing expulsion; they may be in the class of offenses entailing suspension; they may be in the class of serious offenses; they may be in the class of offenses entailing confession; they may be in the class of offenses of wrong conduct. They originate in one way: from body, speech, and mind. The incurable offense is not settled through any kind of legal issue, in any place, or through any of the principles for settling legal issues. The heavy offense is settled through one kind of legal issue:\footnote{That is, the offense entailing suspension. } a legal issue arising from business. It is settled in one place: in the midst of the Sangha. It is settled through two principles: by resolution face-to-face and by acting according to what has been admitted. The light offenses are settled through one kind of legal issue: a legal issue arising from business. They are settled in three places: in the midst of the Sangha, in the midst of a group, or in the presence of an individual. They are settled through three principles: they may be settled by resolution face-to-face and by acting according to what has been admitted; or they may be settled by resolution face-to-face and by covering over as if with grass. 

\section*{5. The difference between legal issues }

Is\marginnote{32.1} a legal issue arising from a dispute a legal issue arising from an accusation, a legal issue arising from an offense, or a legal issue arising from business?\footnote{At first sight the Pali appears to be a straightforward declarative statement (“a legal issue arising from a dispute is a legal issue arising from an accusation, a legal issue arising from an offense, and a legal issue arising from business”), not a question. Yet this would mean that the next sentence is a direct contradiction to present one. The sub-commentary clears this is up by saying it is meant as a question. Vmv 5.348: \textit{\textsanskrit{Vivādādhikaraṇaṁ} hoti \textsanskrit{anuvādādhikaraṇantiādīsu} \textsanskrit{vivādādhikaraṇameva} \textsanskrit{anuvādādhikaraṇādipi} \textsanskrit{hotīti} \textsanskrit{pucchāya} \textsanskrit{vivādādhikaraṇaṁ} \textsanskrit{vivādādhikaraṇameva} hoti, \textsanskrit{anuvādādayo} na \textsanskrit{hotīti} \textsanskrit{vissajjanaṁ}}, “About the phrase \textit{\textsanskrit{vivādādhikaraṇaṁ} hoti \textsanskrit{anuvādādhikaraṇan}}, etc.: to the question whether a legal issue arising from a dispute is also a legal issue arising from an accusation, etc., the reply is that a legal issue arising from a dispute is a legal issue arising from a dispute, not a legal issue arising from an accusation, etc.” } A legal issue arising from a dispute is neither a legal issue arising from an accusation, nor a legal issue arising from an offense, nor a legal issue arising from business. Nevertheless, because of a legal issue arising from a dispute, there are legal issues arising from accusations, legal issues arising from offenses, and legal issues arising from business. How is this? It may be that monks are disputing, saying, “This is the Teaching”, “This is contrary to the Teaching” … “This is a grave offense”, or “This is a minor offense.” In regard to this, whatever there is of quarreling, arguing, conflict, disputing, variety in opinion, difference in opinion, heated speech, or strife—this is called a legal issue arising from a dispute. When, during a legal issue arising from a dispute, the Sangha disputes, there is a legal issue arising from a dispute. When one who is disputing makes an accusation, there is a legal issue arising from an accusation. When one who is accusing commits an offense, there is a legal issue arising from an offense. When the Sangha does a legal procedure because of that offense, there is a legal issue arising from business. In this way, because of a legal issue arising from a dispute, there are legal issues arising from accusations, legal issues arising from offenses, and legal issues arising from business. 

Is\marginnote{33.1} a legal issue arising from an accusation a legal issue arising from an offense, a legal issue arising from business, or legal issue arising from a dispute? A legal issue arising from an accusation is neither a legal issue arising from an offense, nor a legal issue arising from business, nor a legal issue arising from a dispute. Nevertheless, because of a legal issue arising from an accusation, there are legal issues arising from offenses, legal issues arising from business, and legal issues arising from disputes. How is this? It may be that the monks accuse a monk of failure in morality, failure in conduct, failure in view, or failure in livelihood. In regard to this, whatever there is of accusations, accusing, allegations, blame, taking sides because of friendship, taking part in the accusation, or supporting the accusation—this is called a legal issue arising from an accusation. When, during a legal issue arising from an accusation, the Sangha disputes, there is a legal issue arising from a dispute. When one who is disputing makes an accusation, there is a legal issue arising from an accusation. When one who is accusing commits an offense, there is a legal issue arising from an offense. When the Sangha does a legal procedure because of that offense, there is a legal issue arising from business. In this way, because of a legal issue arising from an accusation, there are legal issues arising from offenses, legal issues arising from business, and legal issues arising from disputes. 

Is\marginnote{34.1} a legal issue arising from an offense a legal issue arising from business, a legal issue arising from a dispute, or a legal issue arising from an accusation? A legal issue arising from an offense is neither a legal issue arising from business, nor a legal issue arising from a dispute, nor a legal issue arising from an accusation. Nevertheless, because of a legal issue arising from an offense, there are legal issues arising from business, legal issues arising from disputes, and legal issues arising from accusations. How is this? There are legal issues arising from offenses because of the five classes of offenses, and there are legal issues arising from offenses because of the seven classes of offenses—these are called legal issues arising from offenses. When, during a legal issue arising from an offense, the Sangha disputes, there is a legal issue arising from a dispute. When one who is disputing makes an accusation, there is a legal issue arising from an accusation. When one who is accusing commits an offense, there is a legal issue arising from an offense. When the Sangha does a legal procedure because of that offense, there is a legal issue arising from business. In this way, because of a legal issue arising from an offense, there are legal issues arising from business, legal issues arising from disputes, and legal issues arising from accusations. 

Is\marginnote{35.1} a legal issue arising from business a legal issue arising from a dispute, a legal issue arising from an accusation, or a legal issue arising from an offense? A legal issue arising from business is neither a legal issue arising from a dispute, nor a legal issue arising from an accusation, nor a legal issue arising from an offense. Nevertheless, because of a legal issue arising from business, there are legal issues arising from disputes, legal issues arising from accusations, and legal issues arising from offenses. How is this? Whatever is the duty or the business of the Sangha—a legal procedure consisting of getting permission, a legal procedure consisting of one motion, a legal procedure consisting of one motion and one announcement, a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements—this is called a legal issue arising from business. When, during a legal issue arising from business, the Sangha disputes, there is a legal issue arising from a dispute. When one who is disputing makes an accusation, there is a legal issue arising from an accusation. When one who is accusing commits an offense, there is a legal issue arising from an offense. When the Sangha does a legal procedure because of that offense, there is a legal issue arising from business. In this way, because of a legal issue arising from business, there are legal issues arising from disputes, legal issues arising from accusations, and legal issues arising from offenses. 

\section*{6. The section on questioning }

When\marginnote{36.1} there is resolution through recollection, is there also resolution face-to-face? When there is resolution face-to-face, is there also resolution through recollection? When there is resolution because of past insanity, is there also resolution face-to-face? When there is resolution face-to-face, is there also resolution because of past insanity? When there is acting according to what has been admitted, is there also resolution face-to-face? When there is resolution face-to-face, is there also acting according to what has been admitted? When there is a majority decision, is there also resolution face-to-face? When there is resolution face-to-face, is there also a majority decision? When there is a further penalty, is there also resolution face-to-face? When there is resolution face-to-face, is there also a further penalty? When there is covering over as if with grass, is there also resolution face-to-face? When there is resolution face-to-face, is there also covering over as if with grass? 

\section*{7. The section on responding }

There\marginnote{37.1} may be an occasion when a legal issue is resolved by resolution face-to-face and resolution through recollection. Then, when there is resolution through recollection there is also resolution face-to-face, and when there is resolution face-to-face there is also resolution through recollection; but there is not resolution because of past insanity, nor acting according to what has been admitted, nor a majority decision, nor a further penalty, nor covering over as if with grass. There may be an occasion when a legal issue is resolved by resolution face-to-face and resolution because of past insanity. … by resolution face-to-face and by acting according to what has been admitted … by resolution face-to-face and by a majority decision … by resolution face-to-face and by a further penalty … There may be an occasion when a legal issue is resolved by resolution face-to-face and by covering over as if with grass. Then, when there is covering over as if with grass there is also resolution face-to-face, and when there is resolution face-to-face there is also covering over as if with grass; but there is not resolution through recollection, nor resolution because of past insanity, nor acting according to what has been admitted, nor a majority decision, nor a further penalty. 

\section*{8. The section on connected }

Is\marginnote{38.1} a resolution face-to-face and a resolution through recollection connected or disconnected? Is it possible to completely separate them and point to their difference? Is a resolution face-to-face and resolution because of past insanity … Is a resolution face-to-face and acting according to what has been admitted … Is a resolution face-to-face and a majority decision … Is a resolution face-to-face and a further penalty … Is a resolution face-to-face and covering over as if with grass connected or disconnected? Is it possible to completely separate them and point to their difference? 

Resolution\marginnote{39.1} face-to-face and resolution through recollection are connected, not disconnected, and it is not possible to completely separate them and point to their difference. Resolution face-to-face and resolution because of past insanity … Resolution face-to-face and acting according to what has been admitted … Resolution face-to-face and a majority decision … Resolution face-to-face and a further penalty … Resolution face-to-face and covering over as if with grass are connected, not disconnected, and it is not possible to completely separate them and point to their difference. 

\section*{9. The sources of the seven principles for settling legal issues }

What\marginnote{40.1} is the source, the origin, the birth, the arising, the production, the origination of resolution face-to-face? What is the source, the origin, the birth, the arising, the production, the origination of resolution through recollection? What is the source, the origin, the birth, the arising, the production, the origination of resolution because of past insanity? What is the source, the origin, the birth, the arising, the production, the origination of acting according to what has been admitted? What is the source, the origin, the birth, the arising, the production, the origination of a majority decision?

Resolution\marginnote{41.1} face-to-face has sources as its source, its origin, its birth, its arising, its production, its origination. Resolution through recollection … Resolution because of past insanity … Acting according to what has been admitted … A majority decision … A further penalty … Covering over as if with grass has sources as its source, its origin, its birth, its arising, its production, its origination. 

What\marginnote{42.1} is the source, the origin, the birth, the arising, the production, the origination of resolution face-to-face? … of resolution through recollection? … of resolution because of past insanity? … of acting according to what has been admitted? … of a majority decision? … of a further penalty? What is the source, the origin, the birth, the arising, the production, the origination of covering over as if with grass?

Resolution through recollection … Resolution because of past insanity … Acting according to what has been admitted … A majority decision … A further penalty … Covering over as if with grass has conditions as its source, its origin, its birth, its arising, its production, its origination. 

How\marginnote{45.1} many roots do the seven principles for settling legal issues have, and how many originations? They have twenty-six roots and thirty-six originations. What are those twenty-six roots? Resolution face-to-face has four roots: face-to-face with the Sangha, face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned. Resolution through recollection has four roots. Resolution because of past insanity has four roots. Acting according to what has been admitted has two roots: The one who confesses and the one he confesses to. A majority decision has four roots. A further penalty has four roots. Covering over as if with grass has four roots: face-to-face with the Sangha, face-to-face with the Teaching, face-to-face with the Monastic Law, face-to-face with the persons concerned.

\section*{10. The variety in meaning, etc., between the seven principles for settling legal issues }

“Are\marginnote{47.1} resolution face-to-face and resolution through recollection different in meaning and different in wording, or the same in meaning and just different in wording?\footnote{There is a \textit{ti} at the end of the text, signifying the end of a quote, but it is not all clear where the quote is supposed to begin. It may well be that at some point the whole text was supposed to be quoted.

“What\marginnote{1.1} is the purpose of accusing? \\
Why is there reminding? \\
What is the purpose of the Sangha? \\
Why is there the taking of advice?\footnote{Sp 5.359: \textit{\textsanskrit{Matikammaṁ} vuccati \textsanskrit{mantaggahaṇaṁ}}, “Taking advice is called \textit{\textsanskrit{matikammaṁ}}.” Vmv 5.359: \textit{\textsanskrit{Mantaggahaṇanti} \textsanskrit{tesaṁ} \textsanskrit{vicāraṇāgahaṇaṁ}, \textsanskrit{suttantikattherānaṁ}, \textsanskrit{vinayadharattherānañca} \textsanskrit{adhippāyagahaṇanti} attho}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Mantaggahaṇa}}: learning from them by investigation; the meaning is learning the meaning from the experts on the discourse and the experts on the Monastic Law.” } 

The\marginnote{2.1} purpose of accusing is reminding, \\
The purpose of reminding is restraint; \\
The purpose of the Sangha is scrutiny,\footnote{Sp 5.359: \textit{\textsanskrit{Saṅgho} \textsanskrit{pariggahatthāyāti} tattha sannipatito \textsanskrit{saṅgho} \textsanskrit{vinicchayapariggahaṇatthāya}; \textsanskrit{dhammādhammaṁ} \textsanskrit{tulanatthāya} \textsanskrit{suvinicchitadubbinicchitaṁ} \textsanskrit{jānanatthāyāti} attho}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Saṅgho} \textsanskrit{pariggahatthāya}}: the Sangha is assembled there for the purpose of investigating to make a decision. The meaning is that it is for the purpose of weighing up what is the Teaching and what is contrary to the Teaching, and for the purpose of knowing what is well and badly decided.” } \\
But taking advice is individual. 

Don’t\marginnote{3.1} speak hastily, \\
Don’t speak fiercely; \\
Don’t be hostile—\\
If you are an investigator. 

Don’t\marginnote{4.1} speak fast, \\
Argumentative speech is not beneficial. \\
In line with the discourses and the Monastic Law, \\
In line with what has been laid down, 

Consider\marginnote{5.1} carefully the proper procedure of examination, \\
As formulated by the skilled Awakened One, \\
Well-spoken in line with the training rules—\\
Do not ruin your future rebirth. \\
You should seek what is beneficial, \\
At the right time, what is connected with the goal. 

The\marginnote{6.1} statements of the accuser and the accused, \\
Do not consider them hastily: \\
If the accuser says the accused has offended, \\
But the accused says he has not, 

Then,\marginnote{7.1} proceeding, \\
Both should be dealt with in line with their admission. \\
The conscientious admit their faults,\footnote{Sp 5.359: \textit{\textsanskrit{Lajjiṁ} \textsanskrit{paṭiññāya} \textsanskrit{kāraye}; \textsanskrit{alajjiṁ} \textsanskrit{vattānusandhināti} attho. \textsanskrit{Tasmā} eva \textsanskrit{paṭiññā} \textsanskrit{lajjīsūti} \textsanskrit{gāthamāha}}, “The meaning is that the conscientious should be dealt with according to their admission, but the shameless according to their conduct. This is why the verse says \textit{\textsanskrit{paṭiññā} \textsanskrit{lajjīsu}}.” } \\
But there is no such thing among the shameless; \\
For even if the shameless should speak a lot, \\
They should be dealt with in line with their conduct. 

What\marginnote{8.1} are the shameless like, \\
In that an admission is not effective? \\
I ask you this: \\
What are they like, the people called shameless? 

They\marginnote{9.1} intentionally commit offenses, \\
Hide their offenses, \\
And follow a wrong course—\\
Such people are called shameless. 

I\marginnote{10.1} too know the truth—\\
Such people are called shameless. \\
And may I ask you something else: \\
What are they like, the people called conscientious? 

They\marginnote{11.1} do not intentionally commit offenses, \\
Nor do they hide them, \\
Nor do they follow a wrong course—\\
Such people are called conscientious. 

I\marginnote{12.1} too know the truth—\\
Such people are called conscientious. \\
And may I ask you something else: \\
What are they like, those who accuse illegitimately? 

They\marginnote{13.1} accuse at the wrong time, untruthfully, \\
Harshly, without benefit; \\
They accuse with a mind of ill will, not a mind of good will—\\
Such a person is called one who accuses illegitimately. 

I\marginnote{14.1} too know the truth—\\
Such a person is called one who accuses illegitimately. \\
And may I ask you something else: \\
What are they like, those who accuse legitimately? 

They\marginnote{15.1} accuse at the right time, truthfully, \\
Gently, beneficially; \\
They accuse with a mind of good will, not a mind of ill will—\\
Such a person is called one who accuses legitimately. 

I\marginnote{16.1} too know the truth—\\
Such a person is called one who accuses legitimately. \\
And may I ask you something else: \\
What are they like, the people called ignorant accusers? 

They\marginnote{17.1} do not know the right order;\footnote{Sp 5.359: \textit{\textsanskrit{Pubbāparaṁ} na \textsanskrit{jānātīti} \textsanskrit{purekathitañca} \textsanskrit{pacchākathitañca} na \textsanskrit{jānāti}}, “They do not know the right order: they do not know what was said first and what afterwards.” } \\
They are ignorant about it. \\
They do not know the sequence of statements; \\
They are ignorant about it—\\
Such people are called ignorant accusers. 

I\marginnote{18.1} too know the truth—\\
Such people are called ignorant accusers. \\
And may I ask you something else: \\
What are they like, the people called learned accusers? 

They\marginnote{19.1} know the right order; \\
They are knowledgeable about it. \\
They know the sequence of statements; \\
They are knowledgeable about it—\\
Such people are called learned accusers.

Such people are called learned accusers. \\
And may I ask you something else: \\
What is meant by accusing? 

One\marginnote{21.1} accuses because of failure in morality, \\
And for failure in conduct and view; \\
Also one accuses for failure in livelihood—\\
Because of this it is called accusing.”

\section*{1. Investigation }

The\marginnote{1.1} investigator should ask the accuser: “Do you accuse this monk of failure in morality, conduct, or view?”

If\marginnote{1.16} he says, “I’m accusing him because of what I’ve seen,” “I’m accusing him because of what I’ve heard,” or “I’m accusing him because of what I suspect,” he should be asked, “Since you’re accusing this monk because of what you’ve seen, what have you seen?

Did you see him commit a serious offense? … an offense entailing confession? … an offense entailing acknowledgment? … an offense of wrong conduct? … an offense of wrong speech? Where were you? Where was this monk? What were you doing? What was this monk doing?” 

If\marginnote{1.23} he says, “I didn’t accuse this monk because of what I’ve seen, but because of what I’ve heard,” he should be asked, “Since you’re accusing this monk because of what you’ve heard, what have you heard?

Did you hear that he has committed an offense entailing suspension? … a serious offense? … an offense entailing confession? … an offense entailing acknowledgment? … an offense of wrong conduct?

Or did you hear it from kings, a king’s officials, the monastics of another religion, or the lay followers of another religion?” 

If\marginnote{1.31} he says, “I didn’t accuse this monk because of what I’ve heard, but because of what I suspect,” he should be asked, “Since you’re accusing this monk because of suspicion, what do you suspect?

What\marginnote{5.1} is the beginning, the middle, and the end of an accusation? Getting permission for the accusation is the beginning, doing it is the middle, settling it is the end. 

How\marginnote{5.3} many roots does accusing have, how many bases, and how many grounds? And in how many ways does one accuse? It has two roots, three bases, and five grounds. And one accuses in two ways. 

What\marginnote{5.5} are the two roots? With a root and without a root. What are the three bases? The seen, the heard, and the suspected. What are the five grounds? “I’ll speak at an appropriate time, not at an inappropriate one; I’ll speak the truth, not falsehood; I’ll speak gently, not harshly; I’ll speak what’s beneficial, not what’s unbeneficial; I’ll speak with a mind of good will, not with ill will.” What are the two ways of accusing? One accuses by body or by speech. 

\section*{2. The proceeding of an accuser, etc. }

How\marginnote{7.1} should the accuser proceed? How should the accused proceed? How should the Sangha proceed? How should the investigator proceed? 

“How\marginnote{7.5} should the accuser proceed?” The accuser should set up five qualities before accusing another: “I’ll speak at an appropriate time, not at an inappropriate one; I’ll speak the truth, not falsehood; I’ll speak gently, not harshly; I’ll speak what’s beneficial, not what’s unbeneficial; I’ll speak with a mind of good will, not with ill will.” 

“How\marginnote{7.8} should the accused proceed?” The accused should set up two qualities: truth and composure. 

“How\marginnote{7.12} should the Sangha proceed?” The Sangha should know what has been brought before it and what has not.\footnote{Sp 5.363: \textit{\textsanskrit{Otiṇṇānotiṇṇaṁ} \textsanskrit{jānitabbanti} \textsanskrit{otiṇṇañca} \textsanskrit{anotiṇṇañca} \textsanskrit{vacanaṁ} \textsanskrit{jānitabbaṁ}. \textsanskrit{Tatrāyaṁ} \textsanskrit{jānanavidhi} – \textsanskrit{ettakā} codakassa \textsanskrit{pubbakathā}, \textsanskrit{ettakā} \textsanskrit{pacchimakathā}, \textsanskrit{ettakā} cuditakassa \textsanskrit{pubbakathā}, \textsanskrit{ettakā} \textsanskrit{pacchimakathāti} \textsanskrit{jānitabbā}.

The accuser is to be assessed, so is the accused and the investigator. If the investigator mangles (his speech) even a little, he should be told, ‘Reflect, fix it up, and then speak.’ This how the Sangha should proceed.” } 

“How\marginnote{7.15} should the investigator proceed?” The investigator resolves that legal issue in accordance with the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction. 

\begin{verse}%
What\marginnote{8.1} is the purpose of the observance-day ceremony? \\
Why is there an invitation ceremony? \\
What is the purpose of probation? \\
Why is there a sending back to the beginning? \\
What is the purpose of the trial period? \\
Why is there rehabilitation? 

The\marginnote{9.1} purpose of the observance-day ceremony is unity. \\
The purpose of the invitation ceremony is purity. \\
The purpose of probation is the trial period. \\
The purpose of sending back to the beginning is restraint. \\
The purpose of the trial period is rehabilitation. \\
The purpose of rehabilitation is purity. 

If,\marginnote{10.1} because of desire, ill will, fear, or confusion, \\
One reviles senior monks, \\
Then, when the body breaks up, that foolish person, \\
Damaged, with impaired faculties, \\
Being stupid, goes to hell, \\
Without respect for the training.

Not depending on individuals,\footnote{Sp 5.364: \textit{Na ca \textsanskrit{nissāya} puggalanti “\textsanskrit{ayaṁ} me \textsanskrit{upajjhāyo} \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{ācariyo} \textsanskrit{vā}”\textsanskrit{tiādinā} nayena \textsanskrit{chandādīhi} gacchanto \textsanskrit{puggalaṁ} \textsanskrit{nissāya} karoti, \textsanskrit{evaṁ} na kareyya}, “Not depending on individuals: through the method that begins with thinking, ‘This is my preceptor or teacher,’ one does not create dependence on an individual through desire, etc.” } \\

“When\marginnote{1.1} a monk who is involved in a conflict is about to approach the Sangha, he should: be humble; be intent on removing defilements;\footnote{Sp 5.365: \textit{\textsanskrit{Rajoharaṇasamenāti} \textsanskrit{pādapuñchanasamena}; \textsanskrit{yathā} \textsanskrit{rajoharaṇassa} \textsanskrit{saṁkiliṭṭhe} \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{asaṁkiliṭṭhe} \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{pāde} \textsanskrit{puñchiyamāne} neva \textsanskrit{rāgo} na doso}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Rajoharaṇasamena}}: like a doormat. As when wiping dirty or clean feet with a floor cloth, there is neither desire nor ill will.” } be skilled in appropriate seating and where to sit down, taking a seat without encroaching on the senior monks and without blocking the junior monks; not ramble or engage in worldly talk, but speak according to the Teaching or invite others to speak or value noble silence.\footnote{Sp 5.365: \textit{\textsanskrit{Anānākathikenāti} \textsanskrit{nānāvidhaṁ} \textsanskrit{taṁ} \textsanskrit{taṁ} \textsanskrit{anatthakathaṁ} akathentena}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Anānākathika}}: not speaking a variety of unbeneficial talk.” } 

An\marginnote{2.1} investigator—who has been approved by the Sangha and who wishes to investigate—should not ask about preceptor, teacher, student, pupil, co-student, co-pupil, caste, name, family, reciter tradition, home address, or nationality.\footnote{Sp 5.365: \textit{Na \textsanskrit{upajjhāyo} pucchitabboti “ko \textsanskrit{nāmo} \textsanskrit{tuyhaṁ} \textsanskrit{upajjhāyo}”ti na pucchitabbo}, “\textit{Na \textsanskrit{upajjhāyo} pucchitabbo}: he is not to be asked: ‘What is the name of your preceptor?’” } What is the reason for that? In these cases there is affection or ill will. When there is affection or ill will, one might be biased by favoritism, ill will, confusion, or fear. 

An\marginnote{3.1} investigator—who has been approved by the Sangha and who wishes to investigate—should respect the Sangha, not individuals; should value the true Dhamma, not worldly things; should value the goal, not conforming to the gathering; should investigate at an appropriate time, not at an inappropriate one; should investigate truthfully, not falsely; should investigate gently, not harshly; should investigate beneficially, not unbeneficially; should investigate with a mind of good will, not with ill will; should not whisper in the ear; should not look for flaws; should not wink; should not raise an eyebrow; should not raise the head; should not signal with the hand; should not gesture with the hand. 

He\marginnote{4.1} should be skilled in appropriate seating and where to sit down. Looking a plow’s length ahead, acting in line with his aim, he should sit down on his own seat. He should not get up from his seat, bungle the investigation, take a wrong path, or gesticulate. He should proceed without haste or force, not be fierce, and be patient with others’ speech. He should have mind of loving kindness with compassion and empathy, and strive for what is beneficial. He should not speak idly but to the point, without being angry or argumentative. He should assess himself, the others, the accuser, the accused, one who accuses illegitimately, one who is accused illegitimately, one who accuses legitimately, and one who is accused legitimately. Not omitting what has been said, nor announcing what has not been said, he should carefully scrutinize the sentences and words under consideration, question the others, and deal with them according to what they have admitted. He should gladden those who are confused, comfort those who are frightened, restrain those who are fierce, and expose those who are impure. Being upright and gentle, he should not be biased by favoritism, anger, confusion, or fear. He should be impartial in regard to the Teaching and the people involved.\footnote{Sp 5.365: \textit{Na \textsanskrit{vītihātabbanti} na vinicchayo \textsanskrit{hāpetabbo}}, “\textit{Na \textsanskrit{vītihātabba}}: the investigation should not be bungled.” | Sp 5.365: \textit{\textsanskrit{Anasuruttenāti} na asuruttena. \textsanskrit{Asuruttaṁ} vuccati \textsanskrit{viggāhikakathāsaṅkhātaṁ} \textsanskrit{asundaravacanaṁ}; \textsanskrit{taṁ} na kathetabbanti attho}, “\textit{Anasuruttena}: not \textit{asuruttena}.

\section*{2. Not to be biased }

\begin{description}%
\item[He should not be biased by favoritism: ] How\marginnote{12.2} is one biased by favoritism? 

It\marginnote{12.3} may be that someone thinks, “This is my preceptor, teacher, student, pupil, co-student, co-pupil, friend, companion, or relative.” To be compassionate toward and protect this person, he proclaims what is contrary to the Teaching as being in accordance with it and what is in accordance with the Teaching as contrary to it. He proclaims what is contrary to the Monastic Law as being in accordance with it, and what is in accordance with the Monastic Law as contrary to it. He proclaims what hasn’t been spoken by the Buddha as spoken by him, and what has been spoken by the Buddha as not spoken by him.

\item[He should not be biased by fear: ] How\marginnote{15.2} is one biased by fear? 

It\marginnote{15.3} may be that someone thinks, “This one relies on the uneven, on thick covers, and on powerful individuals; he’s cruel and harsh, and might be a threat to life or the monastic life.” Fearful or frightened of him, he proclaims what is contrary to the Teaching as being in accordance with it and what is in accordance with the Teaching as contrary to it. He proclaims what is contrary to the Monastic Law as being in accordance with it, and what is in accordance with the Monastic Law as contrary to it. He proclaims what hasn’t been spoken by the Buddha as spoken by him, and what has been spoken by the Buddha as not spoken by him.

Which\marginnote{8.2} things are a condition for the prior duties by being a proximity condition … Which things are a condition for relinquishment …\footnote{Sp 5.404: \textit{\textsanskrit{Paccuddhārassāti} \textsanskrit{purāṇasaṅghāṭiādīnaṁ} \textsanskrit{paccuddharaṇassa}}, “Relinquishment: relinquishment of the old outer robe, etc.” } Which things are a condition for determining …\footnote{Sp 5.404: \textit{\textsanskrit{Adhiṭṭhānassāti} \textsanskrit{kathinacīvarādhiṭṭhānassa}}, “Determining: determining of the robe of the robe-making ceremony.” } Which things are a condition for participating in the robe-making ceremony … Which things are a condition for the key phrases and the obstacles … Which things are a condition for the object by being a proximity condition, an immediacy condition, a support condition, a decisive support condition, a pre-arising condition, a post-arising condition, and a co-arising condition?\footnote{Sp 5.404: \textit{\textsanskrit{Vatthussāti} \textsanskrit{saṅghāṭiādino} kathinavatthussa}, “Object: the object of the robe-making ceremony, which is the outer robe, etc.” } 

The\marginnote{9.1} prior duties are a condition for effort by being a proximity condition, an immediacy condition, a support condition, and a decisive support condition.\footnote{Sp 5.404: \textit{\textsanskrit{Yasmā} tena payogena \textsanskrit{nipphādetabbassa} \textsanskrit{pubbakaraṇassatthāya} so payogo kayirati, \textsanskrit{tasmā} imehi \textsanskrit{catūhi} paccayehi paccayo hoti}, “Because that effort is done for the purpose of the preliminary actions, which are to be produced by that effort, therefore it is the condition by way of these four conditions.” It is curious that the prior duties are said to be conditions for effort when in fact the effort is done first and the outcome is the prior duties. The commentary explains this strange state of affairs as follows. Sp 5.404: \textit{Katame \textsanskrit{dhammā} anantarapaccayena paccayoti \textsanskrit{anāgatavasena} \textsanskrit{anantarā} \textsanskrit{hutvā} katame \textsanskrit{dhammā} \textsanskrit{paccayā} \textsanskrit{hontīti} attho}, “Which things are a condition as a proximity condition: which things are conditions of proximity by way of the future? This is the meaning.” In this way the ordinary conditioning relationship is inverted, that is, the condition is temporarily later than the outcome. We see the same pattern below. My sincere thanks go to Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi for helping me untangle the ideas in this section. } Effort is a condition for the prior duties by being a pre-arising condition. The prior duties are a condition for effort by being a post-arising condition. The fifteen things are a condition by being a co-arising condition. 

Relinquishment\marginnote{9.5} is a condition for the prior duties by being a proximity condition, an immediacy condition, a support condition, and a decisive support condition. The prior duties are a condition for relinquishment by being a pre-arising condition. Relinquishment is a condition for the prior duties by being a post-arising condition. The fifteen things are a condition by being a co-arising condition. 

Determining\marginnote{9.9} is a condition for relinquishment by being a proximity condition, an immediacy condition, a support condition, and a decisive support condition. Relinquishment is a condition for determining by being a pre-arising condition. Determining is a condition for relinquishment by being a post-arising condition. The fifteen things are a condition by being a co-arising condition. 

Performing\marginnote{9.13} the robe-making ceremony is a condition for determining by being a proximity condition, an immediacy condition, a support condition, and a decisive support condition. Determining is a condition for performing the robe-making ceremony by being a pre-arising condition. Performing the robe-making ceremony is a condition for determining by being a post-arising condition. The fifteen things are a condition by being a co-arising condition. 

The\marginnote{9.17} key phrases and the obstacles are a condition for performing the robe-making ceremony by being a proximity condition, an immediacy condition, a support condition, and a decisive support condition. Performing the robe-making ceremony is a condition for the key phrases and the obstacles by being a pre-arising condition. The key phrases and the obstacles are a condition for performing the robe-making ceremony by being a post-arising condition. The fifteen things are a condition by being a co-arising condition. 

Expectation\marginnote{9.21} and non-expectation are a condition for the object by being a proximity condition, an immediacy condition, a support condition, and a decisive support condition. The object is a condition for expectation and non-expectation by being a pre-arising condition. Expectation and non-expectation are a condition for the object by being a post-arising condition. The fifteen things are a condition by being a co-arising condition.

How should the one who performs the robe-making ceremony proceed? How should one who expresses their appreciation proceed? 

The\marginnote{36.1} Sangha should give the cloth, through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and one announcement, to the monk who is performing the robe-making ceremony. The monk who is performing the robe-making ceremony should wash the cloth, iron it, plan it, cut it, sew it, dye it, mark it, and then perform the robe-making ceremony. If he wishes to perform the robe-making ceremony with an outer robe, he should relinquish his old outer robe and then determine the new one. He should then say, “I perform the robe-making ceremony with this outer robe.” If he wishes to perform the robe-making ceremony with an upper robe, he should relinquish his old upper robe and then determine the new one. He should then say, “I perform the robe-making ceremony with this upper robe.” If he wishes to perform the robe-making ceremony with a sarong, he should relinquish his old sarong and then determine the new one. He should then say, “I perform the robe-making ceremony with this sarong.”

The robe-making ceremony is legitimate. Please express your appreciation.” The monks who are expressing their appreciation should arrange their upper robes over one shoulder, raise their joined palms, and say: “The Sangha’s robe-making ceremony has been performed. The robe-making ceremony is legitimate. We express our appreciation.” 

Or:\marginnote{36.12} after approaching several monks, that monk who is performing the robe-making ceremony should arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, raise his joined palms, and say:\footnote{For an explanation of the rendering “several” for \textit{sambahula}, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } “Venerable sirs, the Sangha’s robe-making ceremony has been performed. The robe-making ceremony is legitimate. Please express your appreciation.” The monks who are expressing their appreciation should arrange their upper robes over one shoulder, raise their joined palms, and say: “The Sangha’s robe-making ceremony has been performed.

\section*{5. The robe-making ceremony for an individual }

“Does\marginnote{37.1} the Sangha perform the robe-making ceremony? Does a group perform the robe-making ceremony? Does an individual perform the robe-making ceremony?” “The Sangha does not perform the robe-making ceremony, nor does a group, but an individual does.” If the Sangha does not perform the robe-making ceremony, nor a group, but an individual does, then the Sangha has not performed the robe-making ceremony, nor has a group, but an individual has. 

“Does\marginnote{37.5} the Sangha recite the Monastic Code? Does a group recite the Monastic Code? Does an individual recite the Monastic Code?” “The Sangha does not recite the Monastic Code, nor does a group, but an individual does.” If the Sangha does not recite the Monastic Code, nor a group, but an individual does, then the Sangha has not recited the Monastic Code, nor has a group, but an individual has. 

“Yet\marginnote{37.9} when an individual recites to unite the Sangha, to unite the group, then the Monastic Code has been recited by the Sangha, by the group, and by the individual. It is in this way that the Sangha does not perform the robe-making ceremony, nor does a group, but an individual does. Yet when an individual performs the robe-making ceremony, and the Sangha expresses its appreciation, the group expresses its appreciation, then the robe-making ceremony has been performed by the Sangha, by the group, and by the individual.”

\section*{1. The subchapter on “without formal support” }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. Venerable \textsanskrit{Upāli} went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said, “Venerable sir, what sort of monk should live with formal support for life?” 

“One\marginnote{2.1} who has five qualities, \textsanskrit{Upāli}: (1) he doesn’t know about the observance-day ceremony; (2) he doesn’t know the observance-day procedure; (3) he doesn’t know the Monastic Code; (4) he doesn’t know the recitation of the Monastic Code; (5) he has less than five years of seniority.\footnote{For an explanation of the rendering “observance-day ceremony” for \textit{uposatha}, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } But a monk who has five qualities may live without formal support for life: (1) he knows about the observance-day ceremony; (2) he knows the observance-day procedure; (3) he knows the Monastic Code; (4) he knows the recitation of the Monastic Code; (5) he has five or more years of seniority. 

A\marginnote{3.1} monk who has five other qualities should also live with formal support for life: (1) he doesn’t know about the invitation ceremony; (2) he doesn’t know the invitation procedure; (3) he doesn’t know the Monastic Code; (4) he doesn’t know the recitation of the Monastic Code; (5) he has less than five years of seniority.\footnote{For an explanation of the rendering “invitation ceremony” for \textit{\textsanskrit{pavāraṇā}}, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } But a monk who has five qualities may live without formal support for life: (1) he knows about the invitation ceremony; (2) he knows the invitation procedure; (3) he knows the Monastic Code; (4) he knows the recitation of the Monastic Code; (5) he has five or more years of seniority. 

A\marginnote{4.1} monk who has five other qualities should also live with formal support for life: (1) he doesn’t know the offenses and non-offenses; (2) he doesn’t know the light and heavy offenses; (3) he doesn’t know the curable and incurable offenses; (4) he doesn’t know the grave and minor offenses; (5) he has less than five years of seniority.

“Sir,\marginnote{5.1} what sort of monk shouldn’t give the full ordination or formal support, nor have a novice monk attend on him?”\footnote{For an explanation of the rendering “formal support” for \textit{nissaya}, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } 

“One\marginnote{6.1} who has five qualities: He’s incapable of three things in regard to a student: (1) of nursing him or having him nursed when he’s sick; (2) of sending him away or having him sent away when he’s discontent with the spiritual life; and (3) of using the Teaching to dispel anxiety. And (4) he is incapable of training him in the Teaching; and (5) he is incapable of training him in the Monastic Law.

A\marginnote{7.1} monk who has five other qualities also shouldn’t give the full ordination or formal support, nor have a novice monk attend on him: He’s incapable of five things in regard to a student: (1) of training him in good conduct; (2) of training him in the basics of the spiritual life; (3) of training him in the higher morality; (4) of training him in the higher mind; (5) of training him in the higher wisdom. But a monk who has five qualities may give the full ordination and formal support, and he may have a novice monk attend on him: He’s capable of five things in regard to a student: (1) of training him in good conduct; (2) of training him in the basics of the spiritual life; (3) of training him in the higher morality; (4) of training him in the higher mind; (5) of training him in the higher wisdom.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{8.1} against what sort of monk should a legal procedure be done?” 

“Against\marginnote{9.1} one who has five qualities: he is shameless, ignorant, and not a regular monk, and he has wrong view, and he has failed in livelihood. 

A\marginnote{10.1} legal procedure should also be done against a monk who has five other qualities: he has failed in the higher morality; he has failed in conduct; he has failed in view; he has wrong view; and he has failed in livelihood. 

A\marginnote{11.1} legal procedure should also be done against a monk who has five other qualities: his bodily conduct is frivolous; his verbal conduct is frivolous; his bodily and verbal conduct are frivolous; he has wrong view; and he has failed in livelihood. 

A\marginnote{12.1} legal procedure should also be done against a monk who has five other qualities: he is improperly behaved by body; he is improperly behaved by speech; he is improperly behaved by body and speech; he has wrong view; and he has failed in livelihood. 

A\marginnote{13.1} legal procedure should also be done against a monk who has five other qualities: his bodily conduct is harmful; his verbal conduct is harmful; his bodily and verbal conduct are harmful; he has wrong view; and he has failed in livelihood. 

A\marginnote{14.1} legal procedure should also be done against a monk who has five other qualities: he has wrong livelihood by body; he has wrong livelihood by speech; he has wrong livelihood by body and speech; he has wrong view; and he has failed in livelihood.

A\marginnote{16.1} legal procedure should also be done against a monk who has five other qualities: (1) he commits the same offense for which the Sangha did the legal procedure against him; (2) he commits an offense similar to the one for which the Sangha did the legal procedure against him; (3) he commits an offense worse than the one for which the Sangha did the legal procedure against him; (4) he criticizes the procedure; (5) he criticizes those who did the procedure. 

A\marginnote{17.1} legal procedure should also be done against a monk who has five other qualities: he disparages the Buddha; he disparages the Teaching; he disparages the Sangha; he has wrong view; and he has failed in livelihood.”

\section*{2. The subchapter on not lifting }

“Sir,\marginnote{22.1} for what sort of monk should a legal procedure not be lifted?” 

“For\marginnote{23.1} one who has five qualities, \textsanskrit{Upāli}: if, after committing an offense and having had a legal procedure done against him, he: (1) gives the full ordination, (2) gives formal support, (3) has a novice monk attend on him, (4) accepts being appointed as an instructor of the nuns, (5) instructs the nuns, whether appointed or not. 

A\marginnote{24.1} legal procedure should also not be lifted for a monk who has five other qualities: (1) he commits the same offense for which the Sangha did the legal procedure against him; (2) he commits an offense similar to the one for which the Sangha did the legal procedure against him; (3) he commits an offense worse than the one for which the Sangha did the legal procedure against him; (4) he criticizes the procedure; (5) he criticizes those who did the procedure.

A\marginnote{26.1} legal procedure should also not be lifted for a monk who has five other qualities: he is shameless, ignorant, and not a regular monk, and he is a bully, and he doesn’t fulfill the training in proper conduct.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{27.1} when a monk is involved in a conflict and is about to approach the Sangha, how many qualities should he first set up in himself?” 

“He\marginnote{28.1} should set up five qualities in himself: (1) he should be humble; (2) he should be intent on removing defilements; (3) he should be skilled in appropriate seating and where to sit down, taking a seat without encroaching on the senior monks and without blocking the junior monks; (4) he shouldn’t ramble or engage in worldly talk, but should speak according to the Teaching or invite others to speak or value noble silence; (5) if the Sangha is doing legal procedures requiring unity, but the monk doesn’t approve, then he should reveal his view but think, ‘I shouldn’t be at variance with the Sangha,’ and unity can then be announced.” 

“What\marginnote{29.1} sort of monk does the majority dislike and disapprove of when he speaks in the Sangha?” 

“One\marginnote{30.1} who has five qualities: (1) he’s arrogant; (2) he repeats what others say; (3) he doesn’t keep to the topic; (4) he doesn’t accuse others according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, or their offense; (5) he doesn’t act according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, or his offenses.

When\marginnote{32.1} a monk has five other qualities, the majority dislikes and disapproves of him when he speaks in the Sangha: (1) he speaks forcefully; (2) he speaks without having gotten permission; (3) he doesn’t accuse others according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, or their offense; (4) he doesn’t act according to the Teaching, the Monastic Law, or his offenses; (5) he doesn’t explain things according to his own view.

“Sir,\marginnote{33.1} how many benefits are there of studying the Monastic Law?” 

“There\marginnote{34.1} are these five benefits: (1) your own morality is well guarded; (2) you’re a refuge for those who are habitually anxious; (3) you speak with confidence in the midst of the Sangha; (4) you can legitimately and properly refute an opponent; (5) you’re practicing for the longevity of the true Teaching.”

\section*{4. The subchapter on revealing one’s view }

“Sir,\marginnote{54.1} how many illegitimate kinds of revealing one’s view are there?” 

“There\marginnote{55.1} are five, \textsanskrit{Upāli}: (1) one reveals a view about a non-offense; (2) one reveals a view about an offense that isn’t clearable by confession; (3) one reveals a view about an offense that has been confessed; (4) one reveals a view to four or five people; (5) one reveals a view by mind.\footnote{Sp 5.425: \textit{\textsanskrit{Anāpattiyā} \textsanskrit{diṭṭhiṁ} \textsanskrit{āvi} \textsanskrit{karotīti} \textsanskrit{anāpattimeva} \textsanskrit{āpattīti} \textsanskrit{desetīti} attho}, “‘One reveals a view about a non-offense’: the meaning is that one confesses a non-offense as an offense.” Sp 5.425: \textit{\textsanskrit{Catūhi} \textsanskrit{pañcahi} \textsanskrit{diṭṭhinti} … \textsanskrit{cattāro} \textsanskrit{pañca} \textsanskrit{janā} ekato \textsanskrit{āpattiṁ} \textsanskrit{desentīti} attho}, “‘A view to four or five people’: … The meaning is that he confesses the offense to four or five people together.” Sp 5.425: \textit{\textsanskrit{Manomānasena} … \textsanskrit{vacībhedaṁ} \textsanskrit{akatvā} citteneva \textsanskrit{āpattiṁ} \textsanskrit{desetīti} attho}, “‘By mind’: the meaning is that he confesses the offense by mind, without breaking into speech.” } 

But\marginnote{56.1} there are five legitimate kinds of revealing one’s view: (1) one reveals a view about an offense; (2) one reveals a view about an offense that’s clearable by confession; (3) one reveals a view about an offense that hasn’t been confessed; (4) one doesn’t reveal a view to four or five people; (5) one doesn’t reveal a view by mind. 

There\marginnote{57.1} are five other illegitimate kinds of revealing one’s view: (1) one reveals a view to someone who belongs to a different Buddhist sect; (2) one reveals a view to someone in a different monastery zone; (3) one reveals a view to someone who’s not a regular monk; (4) one reveals a view to four or five people; (5) one reveals a view by mind. 

But\marginnote{58.1} there are five legitimate kinds of revealing one’s view: (1) one reveals a view to someone who belongs to the same Buddhist sect; (2) one reveals a view to someone in the same monastery zone; (3) one reveals a view to a regular monk; (4) one doesn’t reveal a view to four or five people; (5) one doesn’t reveal a view by mind.” 

“How\marginnote{59.1} many illegitimate kinds of receiving are there?” 

“There\marginnote{60.1} are five: (1) when someone gives by body and one doesn’t receive by body; (2) when someone gives by body and one doesn’t receive with something connected to the body; (3) when someone gives with something connected to the body and one doesn’t receive by body; (4) when someone gives with something connected to the body and one doesn’t receive with something connected to the body; (5) when someone gives by releasing and one doesn’t receive by body or with something connected to the body. 

But\marginnote{61.1} there are five legitimate kinds of receiving: (1) when someone gives by body and one receives by body; (2) when someone gives by body and one receives with something connected to the body; (3) when someone gives with something connected to the body and one receives by body; (4) when someone gives with something connected to the body and one receives with something connected to the body; (5) when someone gives by releasing and one receives by body or with something connected to the body.” 

“In\marginnote{62.1} how many ways is something considered ‘not left over’?” 

“In\marginnote{63.1} five ways: (1) the making it left over is done with food that’s unallowable; (2) it’s done with food that hasn’t been received; (3) it’s done with food that’s not held in hand; (4) it’s done by one who’s not within arm’s reach; (5) ‘I’ve had enough,’ hasn’t been said. 

And\marginnote{64.1} there are five aspects for something to be considered ‘left over’: (1) the making it left over is done with food that’s allowable; (2) it’s done with food that has been received; (3) it’s done with food that’s held in hand; (4) it’s done by one who’s within arm’s reach; (5) ‘I’ve had enough,’ has been said.” 

“How\marginnote{65.1} many aspects are there of refusing an invitation to eat more?” 

“There\marginnote{66.1} are five aspects: there is eating; there is cooked food; they stand within arm’s reach; there is an offering; there is a refusal.” 

“How\marginnote{67.1} many illegitimate ways are there of acting according to what has been admitted?” 

“There\marginnote{68.1} are five ways: (1) A monk has committed an offense entailing expulsion. When he’s accused of having committed such an offense, he admits to committing an offense entailing suspension. The Sangha deals with him for an offense entailing suspension. That acting according to what has been admitted is illegitimate. Again, a monk has committed an offense entailing expulsion. When he’s accused of having committed such an offense, he admits to committing an offense entailing confession … an offense entailing acknowledgment … an offense of wrong conduct. The Sangha deals with him for an offense of wrong conduct. That acting according to what has been admitted is illegitimate. 

(2)\marginnote{68.7} A monk has committed an offense entailing suspension … 

(3)\marginnote{68.8} A monk has committed an offense entailing confession … 

(4)\marginnote{68.9} A monk has committed an offense entailing acknowledgment …

When he’s accused of having committed such an offense, he admits to committing an offense entailing suspension … an offense entailing confession … an offense entailing acknowledgment. The Sangha deals with him for an offense entailing acknowledgment. That acting according to what has been admitted is illegitimate. 

There\marginnote{69.1} are five ways of legitimately acting according to what has been admitted: (1) A monk has committed an offense entailing expulsion. When he’s accused of having committed such an offense, he admits it. The Sangha deals with him for an offense entailing expulsion. That acting according to what has been admitted is legitimate. 

(2)\marginnote{69.4} A monk has committed an offense entailing suspension … 

(3)\marginnote{69.5} A monk has committed an offense entailing confession … 

(4)\marginnote{69.6} A monk has committed an offense entailing acknowledgment … 

(5)\marginnote{69.7} A monk has committed an offense of wrong conduct. When he’s accused of having committed such an offense, he admits it. The Sangha deals with him for an offense of wrong conduct. That acting according to what has been admitted is legitimate.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{70.1} what sort of monk is unqualified to get permission to correct someone?” 

“One\marginnote{71.1} who has five qualities: (1) he’s shameless; (2) he’s ignorant; (3) he’s not a regular monk; (4) he speaks to make someone disrobe, (5) not with the aim of clearing their offenses.

\section*{5. The subchapter on raising an issue }

“Sir,\marginnote{87.1} how many qualities should a monk see in himself before accusing another?” 

“He\marginnote{88.1} should see five qualities in himself: (1) He should reflect: ‘Is my bodily conduct pure and flawless? Is this quality found in me or not?’ If it’s not, there will be those who say, ‘Please train your own bodily conduct first.’ 

(2)\marginnote{90.1} He should reflect: ‘Is my verbal conduct pure and flawless? Is this quality found in me or not?’ If it’s not, there will be those who say, ‘Please train your own verbal conduct first.’ 

(3)\marginnote{91.1} He should reflect: ‘Do I have a mind of good will toward my fellow monastics, a mind free from anger? Is this quality found in me or not?’ If it’s not, there will be those who say, ‘Please set up a mind of good will toward your fellow monastics first.’ 

(4)\marginnote{92.1} He should reflect: ‘Have I learned much and do I retain and accumulate what I’ve learned? Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, that have a true goal and are well articulated, and that set out the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life—have I learned many such teachings, retained them in mind, recited them verbally, mentally investigated them, and penetrated them well by view? Is this quality found in me or not?’ If it’s not, there will be those who say, ‘Please learn the tradition first.’ 

(5)\marginnote{93.1} He should reflect: ‘Have I properly learned both Monastic Codes in detail; have I analyzed them well, thoroughly mastered them, and investigated them well, both in terms of the rules and their detailed exposition? Is this quality found in me or not?’ If it’s not, then when he’s asked, ‘Where was this said by the Buddha?’ he won’t be able to reply. And there will be those who say, ‘Please learn the Monastic Law first.’” 

“Sir,\marginnote{94.1} how many qualities should a monk set up in himself before accusing another?” 

“He\marginnote{95.1} should set up five qualities in himself: (1) ‘I’ll speak at an appropriate time, not at an inappropriate one; (2) I’ll speak the truth, not falsehood; (3) I’ll speak gently, not harshly; (4) I’ll speak what’s beneficial, not what’s unbeneficial; (5) I’ll speak with a mind of good will, not with ill will.’” 

“How\marginnote{96.1} many qualities should a monk attend to in himself before accusing another?” 

“He\marginnote{97.1} should attend to five qualities in himself: compassion, being of benefit, sympathy, the idea of clearing offenses, and the idea of prioritizing the training.” 

“What\marginnote{98.1} sort of monk is unqualified to get permission to correct someone?” 

“One\marginnote{99.1} who has five qualities: (1) he’s impure in bodily conduct; (2) he’s impure in verbal conduct; (3) he’s impure in livelihood; (4) he’s ignorant and incompetent; (5) he’s incapable of answering properly when questioned.” 

But\marginnote{100.1} a monk who has five qualities is qualified to get permission to correct someone: (1) he’s pure in bodily conduct; (2) he’s pure in verbal conduct; (3) he’s pure in livelihood; (4) he’s knowledgeable and competent; (5) he’s capable of answering properly when questioned.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{101.1} if a monk wishes to raise an issue, what factors should be fulfilled?” 

“Five\marginnote{102.1} factors should be fulfilled: He should reflect whether it’s the right time to raise it. If he knows it’s the wrong time, he shouldn’t raise it. 

(1)\marginnote{103.1} But if he knows it’s the right time, he should reflect further whether it’s a real issue. If he knows it’s not, he shouldn’t raise it. 

(2)\marginnote{104.1} But if he knows it is, he should reflect further whether raising the issue will be beneficial. If he knows it won’t, he shouldn’t raise it. 

(3)\marginnote{105.1} But if he knows it will, he should reflect further whether the monks who are on the side of the Teaching and the Monastic Law will support him. If he knows that they won’t, he shouldn’t raise it. 

(4)\marginnote{106.1} But if he knows that they will, he should reflect further whether raising the issue will lead to arguments and disputes, to fracture and schism in the Sangha. If he knows it will, he shouldn’t raise it. 

(5)\marginnote{107.1} But if he knows it won’t, he may raise it. In this way, when five factors are fulfilled, he won’t regret raising that issue.” 

“What\marginnote{108.1} sort of monk is of great help to monks involved in a legal issue?” 

“One\marginnote{109.1} who has five qualities: (1) He’s virtuous and restrained by the Monastic Code. His conduct is good, he associates with the right people, and he sees danger in minor faults. He undertakes and trains in the training rules. (2) He has learned much, and he retains and accumulates what he has learned. (3) Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, that have a true goal and are well articulated, and that set out the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life—he has learned many such teachings, retained them in mind, recited them verbally, mentally investigated them, and penetrated them well by view. (4) He’s firmly committed to the Monastic Law. (5) He’s capable of making both sides relax, of persuading them, of convincing them, of making them see, of reconciling them. 

A\marginnote{110.1} monk who has five other qualities is also of great help to monks involved in a legal issue: he’s pure in bodily conduct; he’s pure in verbal conduct; he’s pure in livelihood; he’s knowledgeable and competent; he’s capable of answering properly when questioned. 

A\marginnote{111.1} monk who has five other qualities is also of great help to monks involved in a legal issue: he knows the actions that are the bases for offenses; he knows the origin stories; he knows the rules; he knows the right order of words; he knows the sequence of statements.”

“(1)\marginnote{197.4} \textsanskrit{Upāli}, I’ve laid down the proper conduct for newly-arrived monks. Even though I’ve carefully laid down the training rules, the newly-arrived monks don’t practice that proper conduct. In this way, there’s fracture in the Sangha, but not schism.

(3)\marginnote{197.10} I’ve laid down the proper conduct for monks in the dining hall: the best seat, the best water, and the best almsfood is to be given out according to seniority and according to what’s proper. Even though I’ve carefully laid down the training rules, the junior monks block the senior monks from seats. In this way, there’s fracture in the Sangha, but not schism. 

(4)\marginnote{197.14} I’ve laid down the proper conduct for the monks in regard to dwellings: they’re to be given out according to seniority and according to what’s proper. Even though I’ve carefully laid down the training rules, the junior monks block the senior monks from dwellings. In this way, there’s fracture in the Sangha, but not schism. 

(5)\marginnote{197.18} For monks within the same monastery zone, I’ve laid down this: a joint observance-day ceremony; a joint invitation ceremony; joint legal procedures of the Sangha; joint legal procedures of whatever kind. Even though I’ve carefully laid down the training rules, they form a faction, a subgroup, right there within the monastery zone. They then do a separate observance-day ceremony, a separate invitation ceremony, separate legal procedures of the Sangha, or separate legal procedures of whatever kind.

If there is no offense in regard to one’s relatives?\footnote{The point seems to be that there is normally no offense in asking from one’s relatives, but \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np24/en/brahmali\#1.18.1}{Bu NP 24:1.18.1} is an exception to this pattern. See Sp-\textsanskrit{ṭ} 1.628. } \\
This question was thought out by those with skill. 

One\marginnote{36.1} angry person is approved of,\footnote{Sp 5.481: \textit{Kuddho \textsanskrit{ārādhako} \textsanskrit{hotīti} \textsanskrit{gāthā} \textsanskrit{titthiyavattaṁ} \textsanskrit{sandhāya} \textsanskrit{vuttā}.

Monastics of other religions fulfilling the proper conduct are angry when the monastics of other religions are praised.” See \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali\#38.10.2}{Kd 1:38.10.2}. } \\
One angry person is censured; \\
What is the name of that rule, \\
In which an angry person is praised? \\
This question was thought out by those with skill. 

One\marginnote{37.1} contented person is approved of,\footnote{Sp 5.481: \textit{\textsanskrit{Dutiyagāthāpi} tameva \textsanskrit{sandhāya} \textsanskrit{vuttā}}, “Also the second verse was spoken with reference to that.” See \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali\#38.7.2}{Kd 1:38.7.2}. } \\
One contented person is censured; \\
What is the name of that rule, \\
In which a contented person is censured? \\
This question was thought out by those with skill. 

An\marginnote{38.1} offense entailing suspension, a serious offense,\footnote{Sp 5.481: \textit{\textsanskrit{Saṅghādisesantiādi} \textsanskrit{gāthā} \textsanskrit{yā} \textsanskrit{bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{avassutāva} avassutassa purisassa hatthato \textsanskrit{piṇḍapātaṁ} \textsanskrit{gahetvā} \textsanskrit{manussamaṁsalasuṇapaṇītabhojanasesaakappiyamaṁsehi} \textsanskrit{saddhiṁ} \textsanskrit{omadditvā} ajjhoharati, \textsanskrit{taṁ} \textsanskrit{sandhāya} \textsanskrit{vuttā}}, “‘An offense entailing suspension’: this verse was spoken with reference to a lustful nun receiving almsfood directly from a lustful man. She then presses it into a mouthful containing human flesh, garlic, fine foods, and the remaining unallowable meats, finally swallowing it.” See respectively \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss5/en/brahmali\#1.14.1}{Bi Ss 5:1.14.1}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali\#23.9.7}{Kd 6:23.9.7}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1/en/brahmali\#1.41.1}{Bi Pc 1:1.41.1}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pd1/en/brahmali\#1.2.9.1}{Bi Pd 1:1.2.9.1}–8, and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali\#23.10.8}{Kd 6:23.10.8}–23.15.9. } \\
An offense entailing confession, one entailing acknowledgment, and one of wrong conduct—\\
How does one commit all together? \\
This question was thought out by those with skill. 

Both\marginnote{39.1} are over twenty years old, \\
Both have the same preceptor, \\
The same teacher, the same ordination procedure—\\
How, then, is it that one is ordained, but not the other?\footnote{Sp 5.481: \textit{Eko upasampanno eko anupasampannoti \textsanskrit{gāthā} \textsanskrit{ākāsagataṁ} \textsanskrit{sandhāya} \textsanskrit{vuttā}.

If one of the two novices, through supernormal power, is seated unconnected to the ground even by a hair’s breadth, he is not ordained.” This ruling is not found in any Canonical text. What is found there is that a person floating in the air cannot make up the quorum for a legal procedure, see \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd9/en/brahmali\#4.5.25}{Kd 9:4.5.25}, nor can such a person object to a legal procedure, see \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd9/en/brahmali\#4.7.28}{Kd 9:4.7.28}. } \\
This question was thought out by those with skill. 

It\marginnote{40.1} is neither marked nor dyed,\footnote{Sp 5.481: \textit{Akappakatanti \textsanskrit{gāthā} \textsanskrit{acchinnacīvarakaṁ} \textsanskrit{bhikkhuṁ} \textsanskrit{sandhāya} \textsanskrit{vuttā}}, “‘It is neither marked’: this verse was spoken with reference to a monk whose robe had been stolen.” See \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np6/en/brahmali\#2.18.1}{Bu NP 6:2.18.1}. } \\
Yet wearing that sarong one may go where one likes—\\
How is there no offense for that person, \\
Yet a rule was taught by the Accomplished One? \\
This question was thought out by those with skill. 

She\marginnote{41.1} neither gives nor receives,\footnote{Sp 5.481: \textit{Na deti na \textsanskrit{paṭiggaṇhātīti} \textsanskrit{nāpi} \textsanskrit{uyyojikā} deti, na \textsanskrit{uyyojitā} \textsanskrit{tassā} hatthato \textsanskrit{gaṇhāti}}, “‘She neither gives nor receives’: the inciter does not give; the one who is incited does not receive directly from her.” } \\
Because of that there is no recipient;\footnote{Sp 5.481: \textit{\textsanskrit{Paṭiggaho} tena na \textsanskrit{vijjatīti} teneva \textsanskrit{kāraṇena} \textsanskrit{uyyojikāya} hatthato \textsanskrit{uyyojitāya} \textsanskrit{paṭiggaho} na vijjati}, “‘Because of that there is no recipient’: for that reason, the one who is incited does not receive directly from the inciter.” } \\
How, then, does she commit a heavy offense,\footnote{Sp 5.481: \textit{Āpajjati garukanti \textsanskrit{evaṁ} santepi avassutassa hatthato \textsanskrit{piṇḍapātaggahaṇe} \textsanskrit{uyyojentī} \textsanskrit{saṅghādisesāpattiṁ} \textsanskrit{āpajjati}}, “‘How, then, does she commit a heavy offense’: when it is like this, she who is inciting her to take almsfood directly from a lustful man, she commits an offense entailing suspension.” } \\
Not a light one, because of using?\footnote{Sp 5.481: \textit{\textsanskrit{Tañca} \textsanskrit{paribhogapaccayāti} \textsanskrit{tañca} pana \textsanskrit{āpattiṁ} \textsanskrit{āpajjamānā} \textsanskrit{tassā} \textsanskrit{uyyojitāya} \textsanskrit{paribhogapaccayā} \textsanskrit{āpajjati}. \textsanskrit{Tassā} hi \textsanskrit{bhojanapariyosāne} \textsanskrit{uyyojikāya} \textsanskrit{saṅghādiseso} \textsanskrit{hotīti}}, “‘Because of using’: in committing that offense, she commits it because of the using by the one who was incited by her.

To sum up, there is an offense entailing suspension for successfully inciting another nun to receive and eat almsfood from a lustful man. } \\
This question was thought out by those with skill. 

She\marginnote{42.1} neither gives nor receives,\footnote{Sp 5.481: \textit{\textsanskrit{Dutiyagāthā} \textsanskrit{tassāyeva} \textsanskrit{udakadantaponaggahaṇe} \textsanskrit{uyyojanaṁ} \textsanskrit{sandhāya} \textsanskrit{vuttā}}, “The second verse was spoken with reference to inciting her to take water or a tooth cleaner.” See \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss6/en/brahmali\#2.2.1}{Bi Ss 6:2.2.1}. } \\
Because of that there is no recipient; \\
How, then, does she commit a light offense, \\
Not a heavy one, because of using? \\
This question was thought out by those with skill. 

One\marginnote{43.1} commits a curable heavy offense, \\
One conceals it out of disrespect; \\
If it was not a nun, how is it that one is not affected by the fault? \\

\section*{1. The subchapter on legal procedures }

There\marginnote{1.1} are four kinds of legal procedures: the legal procedure consisting of getting permission, the legal procedure consisting of one motion, the legal procedure consisting of one motion and one announcement, and the legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements. In how many ways do they fail? In five ways: with respect to object, motion, announcement, monastery zone, or gathering. 

\begin{description}%
\item[How do legal procedures fail with respect to object? ] If\marginnote{2.2} they don’t do a legal procedure face-to-face that should be done face-to-face, that procedure has failed with respect to object and is illegitimate. If they do a legal procedure without questioning that should be done with questioning, that procedure has failed with respect to object and is illegitimate. If they do a legal procedure without admission that should be done by admission, that procedure has failed with respect to object and is illegitimate. If they apply resolution because of past insanity to one deserving resolution through recollection, that procedure has failed with respect to object and is illegitimate. If they do a legal procedure of further penalty against one deserving resolution because of past insanity, that procedure has failed with respect to object and is illegitimate. 

If\marginnote{2.7} they do a legal procedure of condemnation against one deserving a procedure of further penalty, that procedure has failed with respect to object and is illegitimate. If they do a legal procedure of demotion against one deserving a procedure of condemnation, that procedure has failed with respect to object and is illegitimate.\footnote{For an explanation of the rendering “demotion” for \textit{niyassa}, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } If they do a procedure of banishment against one deserving a procedure of demotion, that procedure has failed with respect to object and is illegitimate. If they do a procedure of reconciliation against one deserving a procedure of banishment, that procedure has failed with respect to object and is illegitimate. If they do a legal procedure of ejection against one deserving a procedure of reconciliation, that procedure has failed with respect to object and is illegitimate. 

If\marginnote{2.12} they give probation to one deserving a procedure of ejection, that procedure has failed with respect to object and is illegitimate. If they send back to the beginning one deserving probation, that procedure has failed with respect to object and is illegitimate. If they give the trial period to one deserving to be sent back to the beginning, that procedure has failed with respect to object and is illegitimate. If they rehabilitate one deserving the trial period, that procedure has failed with respect to object and is illegitimate. 

If\marginnote{2.16} they give full ordination to one deserving rehabilitation, that procedure has failed with respect to object and is illegitimate. If they do the observance-day ceremony on a non-observance day, that procedure has failed with respect to object and is illegitimate. If they do the invitation ceremony on a non-invitation day, that procedure has failed with respect to object and is illegitimate. 

%
\item[How do legal procedures fail with respect to motion? ] In five ways: they do not touch on the object, the Sangha, the person, or the motion, or the motion is put forward after the announcement. %
\item[How do legal procedures fail with respect to announcement? ] In five ways: they do not touch on the object, the Sangha, or the person, or an announcement is omitted, or the announcement is made at the wrong time.\footnote{Sp 5.485: \textit{\textsanskrit{Sāvanaṁ} \textsanskrit{hāpetīti} sabbena \textsanskrit{sabbaṁ} \textsanskrit{kammavācāya} \textsanskrit{anussāvanaṁ} na karoti, \textsanskrit{ñattidutiyakamme} \textsanskrit{dvikkhattuṁ} \textsanskrit{ñattimeva} \textsanskrit{ṭhapeti}, \textsanskrit{ñatticatutthakamme} \textsanskrit{catukkhattuṁ} \textsanskrit{ñattimeva} \textsanskrit{ṭhapeti}; \textsanskrit{evaṁ} \textsanskrit{anussāvanaṁ} \textsanskrit{hāpeti}}, “‘The announcement is omitted’: they either do not do the announcement at all; or, in a legal procedure with one motion and one announcement, they just put forward the motion twice; or, in a legal procedure with one motion and three announcements, they just put forward the motion four times. In this way they omit the announcement.” The commentary then goes on to say that even omitting syllables or mispronunciation counts as \textit{\textsanskrit{hāpeti}}. This, however, goes further than the rules for legal procedures laid down in The Chapter Connected with \textsanskrit{Campā} at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd9/en/brahmali\#3.3.3}{Kd 9:3.3.3}–3.4.9. | Sp 5.485: \textit{\textsanskrit{Akāle} \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{sāvetīti} \textsanskrit{sāvanāya} \textsanskrit{akāle} \textsanskrit{anokāse} \textsanskrit{ñattiṁ} \textsanskrit{aṭṭhapetvā} \textsanskrit{paṭhamaṁyeva} \textsanskrit{anussāvanakammaṁ} \textsanskrit{katvā} \textsanskrit{pacchā} \textsanskrit{ñattiṁ} \textsanskrit{ṭhapeti}}, “‘Or the announcement is made at the wrong time’: it is the wrong time, the wrong occasion, for the announcement. Without putting forward the motion, they first make the announcement and then put forward the motion.” } %
\item[How do legal procedures fail with respect to the monastery zone? ] In eleven ways: (1) they establish a zone that is too small; (2) they establish a zone that is too large; (3) they establish an incomplete zone; (4) they establish a zone with a shadow as a zone marker; (5) they establish a zone without zone markers; (6) they establish a zone while standing outside it; (7) they establish a zone in a river; (8) they establish a zone in an ocean; (9) they establish a zone in a lake; (10) they establish a zone that merges with an existing zone; (11) they establish a zone that encloses an existing zone.\footnote{See \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali\#7.1.6}{Kd 2:7.1.6} etc. } %
\item[How do legal procedures fail with respect to gathering? ] In\marginnote{6.2} twelve ways: In regard to legal procedures that require a group of four: (1) the monks who should take part haven’t all arrived, consent has not been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, or someone present objects to the decision; (2) the monks who should take part have arrived, but consent has not been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, or someone present objects to the decision; (3) the monks who should take part have arrived, and consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, but someone present objects to the decision.\footnote{Sp 3.388: \textit{Kammappattoti \textsanskrit{kammaṁ} patto, kammayutto \textsanskrit{kammāraho}; na \textsanskrit{kiñci} \textsanskrit{kammaṁ} \textsanskrit{kātuṁ} \textsanskrit{nārahatīti} attho}, “‘Who should take part’: who are able in regard to the legal procedure, suitable for the legal procedure, fit for the legal procedure. The meaning is that one should not not do any kind of legal procedure.” The last line means one should or must take part in the legal procedure. } 

In\marginnote{6.4} regard to legal procedures that require a group of five: … (4-6) … 

In\marginnote{6.5} regard to legal procedures that require a group of ten: … (7-9) … 

In\marginnote{6.6} regard to legal procedures that require a group of twenty: (10) the monks who should take part haven’t all arrived, consent has not been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, or someone present objects to the decision; (11) the monks who should take part have arrived, but consent has not been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, or someone present objects to the decision; (12) the monks who should take part have arrived, and consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, but someone present objects to the decision.

\end{description}

In\marginnote{7.1} regard to legal procedures that require a group of four, four regular monks should take part, while the remainder of regular monks are entitled to give their consent. The one who is subject to the legal procedure should neither take part in the decision nor give his consent, but is deserving of the legal procedure.\footnote{The one who is subject to the legal procedure cannot take part in the legal procedure in the sense of being part of the decision making. However, he needs to be present \textit{at} the legal procedure when the decision is made. } In regard to legal procedures that require a group of five, five regular monks should take part, while the remainder of regular monks are entitled to give their consent. The one who is subject to the legal procedure should neither take part in the decision nor give his consent, but is deserving of the legal procedure. In regard to legal procedures that require a group of ten, ten regular monks should take part, while the remainder of regular monks are entitled to give their consent. The one who is subject to the legal procedure should neither take part in the decision nor give his consent, but is deserving of the legal procedure. In regard to legal procedures that require a group of twenty, twenty regular monks should take part, while the remainder of regular monks are entitled to give their consent. The one who is subject to the legal procedure should neither take part in the decision nor give his consent, but is deserving of the legal procedure. 

There\marginnote{8.1} are four kinds of legal procedures: the procedure consisting of getting permission, the procedure consisting of one motion, the procedure consisting of one motion and one announcement, and the procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements. In how many ways do they fail? In five ways: with respect to object, motion, announcement, monastery zone, or gathering. 

\begin{description}%
\item[How do legal procedures fail with respect to object? ] If they give the full ordination to a \textit{\textsanskrit{paṇḍaka}}, that procedure has failed in object and is illegitimate.\footnote{For a discussion of the word \textit{\textsanskrit{paṇḍaka}}, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } If they give the full ordination to a fake monk, that procedure has failed in object and is illegitimate. If they give the full ordination to one who has previously left to join the monastics of another religion, that procedure has failed in object and is illegitimate. If they give the full ordination to an animal, that procedure has failed in object and is illegitimate. If they give the full ordination to a matricide, that procedure has failed in object and is illegitimate. If they give the full ordination to a patricide, that procedure has failed in object and is illegitimate. If they give the full ordination to a murderer of a perfected one, that procedure has failed in object and is illegitimate. If they give the full ordination to a rapist of a nun, that procedure has failed in object and is illegitimate.\footnote{For an explanation of the rendering “rapist” for \textit{\textsanskrit{dūsaka}}, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } If they give the full ordination to one who has caused a schism in the Sangha, that procedure has failed in object and is illegitimate. If they give the full ordination to one who has caused the Buddha to bleed, that procedure has failed in object and is illegitimate. If they give the full ordination to a hermaphrodite, that procedure has failed in object and is illegitimate.\footnote{For an explanation of the rendering “hermaphrodite” for \textit{\textsanskrit{ubhatobyañjana}}, see \textit{\textsanskrit{ubhatobyañjanaka}} in Appendix of Technical Terms. } If they give the full ordination to a person less then twenty years old, that procedure has failed in object and is illegitimate. %
\item[How do legal procedures fail with respect to motion? ] In five ways: they do not touch on the object, the Sangha, the person, or the motion, or the motion is put forward after the announcement. %
\item[How do legal procedures fail with respect to announcement? ] In five ways: they do not touch on the object, the Sangha, or the person, or an announcement is omitted, or the announcement is made at the wrong time. %
\item[How do legal procedures fail with respect to the monastery zone? ] In eleven ways: (1) they establish a zone that is too small; (2) they establish a zone that is too large; (3) they establish an incomplete zone; (4) they establish a zone with a shadow as a zone marker; (5) they establish a zone without zone markers; (6) they establish a zone while standing outside it; (7) they establish a zone in a river; (8) they establish a zone in an ocean; (9) they establish a zone in a lake; (10) they establish a zone that merges with an existing zone; (11) they establish a zone that encloses an existing zone. %
\item[How do legal procedures fail with respect to gathering? ] In\marginnote{13.2} twelve ways: In regard to legal procedures that require a group of four: (1) the monks who should take part haven’t all arrived, consent has not been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, or someone present objects to the decision; (2) the monks who should take part have arrived, but consent has not been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, or someone present objects to the decision; (3) the monks who should take part have arrived, and consent has been brought for those who are eligible to give their consent, but someone present objects to the decision.

In\marginnote{14.1} how many situations does the legal procedure consisting of getting permission apply? In how many situations does the legal procedure consisting of one motion apply? In how many situations does the legal procedure consisting of one motion and one announcement apply? In how many situations does the legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements apply? 

A\marginnote{14.5} legal procedure consisting of getting permission applies in five situations. A legal procedure consisting of one motion applies in nine situations. A legal procedure consisting of one motion and one announcement applies in seven situations. A legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements applies in seven situations. 

In\marginnote{15.1} which five situations does the legal procedure consisting of getting permission apply? Admittance, sending away, shaving, the supreme penalty, and any legal procedure with similar characteristics.\footnote{In regard to admittance and sending away, the commentary at Sp 5.496 refers to the expulsion and readmittance of a novice monk on account of bad behavior and the subsequent giving up of the same behavior, see \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali\#60.1.5}{Kd 1:60.1.5}–60.1.15. As for “shaving”, the commentary refers to the Sangha giving permission to shave someone’s head prior to ordination, see \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali\#48.2.7}{Kd 1:48.2.7}. For the “supreme penalty”, see \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd21/en/brahmali\#1.12.1}{Kd 21:1.12.1}–1.12.9. Regarding “any legal procedure with similar characteristics” the commentary points to the allowance for nuns to penalize a monk who is misbehaving toward them, see \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd20/en/brahmali\#9.1.4}{Kd 20:9.1.4}–9.1.24. The commentary at Sp 5.496 then says: \textit{Tassa hi \textsanskrit{kammaññeva} \textsanskrit{lakkhaṇaṁ}, na \textsanskrit{osāraṇādīni}; \textsanskrit{tasmā} “\textsanskrit{kammalakkhaṇa}”nti vuccati}, “It has the characteristics of a legal procedure, but it is not admittance, etc. Therefore it is called a legal procedure with similar characteristics.” } 

In\marginnote{15.4} which nine situations does the legal procedure consisting of one motion apply? Admittance, sending away, the observance day, the invitation ceremony, agreements, giving, receiving, postponement, and any legal procedure with similar characteristics.\footnote{In regard to admittance, the commentary gives the example of \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali\#76.8.4}{Kd 1:76.8.4}–76.8.8. In regard to sending away, it quotes \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd14/en/brahmali\#14.22.3}{Kd 14:14.22.3}–14.22.6.

“There\marginnote{42.1} are nine kinds of ‘being found among’: being found among the actions that are the bases for offenses, being found among the failures, being found among the offenses, being found among the origin stories, being found among persons, being found among the classes, being found among the originations, being found among the legal issues, and being found among the settling of legal issues. 

When\marginnote{43.1} a legal issue has arisen, if the two opponents come, they should be told to inform about the action that was the basis for the disagreement. After hearing the testimony of both, they should be told, ‘When we’ve resolved this legal issue, you should both be satisfied.’ If they say, ‘We’ll both be satisfied,’ then the Sangha should take on that legal issue. If there are many shameless people in the gathering, then the issue should be resolved by means of a committee. If there are many ignorant people in the gathering, they should search for an expert on the Monastic Law to resolve that legal issue in accordance with the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction. That legal issue should be resolved in this way. 

One\marginnote{44.1} should know the basis for an offense, one should know the category, one should know the name, and one should know the offense. 

‘Sexual\marginnote{45.1} intercourse’ is the basis for an offense, as well as a category. ‘Offense entailing expulsion’ is the name, as well as the offense. 

‘Stealing’\marginnote{46.1} is the basis for an offense, as well as a category. ‘Offense entailing expulsion’ is the name, as well as the offense.

‘Superhuman\marginnote{48.1} quality’ is the basis for an offense, as well as a category. ‘Offense entailing expulsion’ is the name, as well as the offense. 

‘Emission\marginnote{49.1} of semen’ is the basis for an offense, as well as a category. ‘Offense entailing suspension’ is the name, as well as the offense. 

‘Physical\marginnote{50.1} contact’ is the basis for an offense, as well as a category. ‘Offense entailing suspension’ is the name, as well as the offense. 

‘Indecent\marginnote{51.1} speech’ is the basis for an offense, as well as a category. ‘Offense entailing suspension’ is the name, as well as the offense. 

‘One’s\marginnote{52.1} own desires’ is the basis for an offense, as well as a category. ‘Offense entailing suspension’ is the name, as well as the offense. 

‘Matchmaking’\marginnote{53.1} is the basis for an offense, as well as a category. ‘Offense entailing suspension’ is the name, as well as the offense. 

‘Building\marginnote{54.1} a hut by means of begging’ is the basis for an offense, as well as a category. ‘Offense entailing suspension’ is the name, as well as the offense. 

‘Building\marginnote{55.1} a large dwelling’ is the basis for an offense, as well as a category. ‘Offense entailing suspension’ is the name, as well as the offense. 

‘Groundlessly\marginnote{56.1} charging a monk with an offense entailing expulsion’ is the basis for an offense, as well as a category. ‘Offense entailing suspension’ is the name, as well as the offense. 

‘Charging\marginnote{57.1} a monk with an offense entailing expulsion, using an unrelated legal issue as a pretext’ is the basis for an offense, as well as a category. ‘Offense entailing suspension’ is the name, as well as the offense. 

‘A\marginnote{58.1} monk not stopping with pursuing schism in the Sangha when pressed for the third time’ is the basis for an offense, as well as a category. ‘Offense entailing suspension’ is the name, as well as the offense. 

‘Monks\marginnote{59.1} not stopping siding with one who is pursuing schism in the Sangha when pressed for the third time’ is the basis for an offense, as well as a category. ‘Offense entailing suspension’ is the name, as well as the offense. 

‘A\marginnote{60.1} monk not stopping with being difficult to correct when pressed for the third time’ is the basis for an offense, as well as a category. ‘Offense entailing suspension’ is the name, as well as the offense. 

‘A\marginnote{61.1} monk not stopping with being a corrupter of families when pressed for the third time’ is the basis for an offense, as well as a category. ‘Offense entailing suspension’ is the name, as well as the offense. … 

‘Out\marginnote{62.1} of disrespect, defecating, urinating, or spitting in water’ is the basis for an offense, as well as a category. ‘Offense of wrong conduct’ is the name, as well as the offense.”

\section*{The Translator}

Bhikkhu Brahmali was born Norway in 1964. He first became interested in Buddhism and meditation in his early 20s after a visit to Japan. Having completed degrees in engineering and finance, he began his monastic training as an anagarika (keeping the eight precepts) in England at Amaravati and Chithurst Buddhist Monastery.

After hearing teachings from Ajahn Brahm he decided to travel to Australia to train at Bodhinyana Monastery. Bhikkhu Brahmali has lived at Bodhinyana Monastery since 1994, and was ordained as a Bhikkhu, with Ajahn Brahm as his preceptor, in 1996. In 2015 he entered his 20th Rains Retreat as a fully ordained monastic and received the title Maha Thera (Great Elder).

Bhikkhu Brahmali’s knowledge of the Pali language and of the Suttas is excellent. Bhikkhu Bodhi, who translated most of the Pali Canon into English for Wisdom Publications, called him one of his major helpers for the 2012 translation of \emph{The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha}. He has also published two essays on Dependent Origination and a book called \emph{The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts} with the Buddhist Publication Society in collaboration with Bhante Sujato.

The monastics of the Buddhist Society of WA (BSWA) often turn to him to clarify Vinaya (monastic discipline) or Sutta questions. They also greatly appreciate his Sutta and Pali classes. Furthermore he has been instrumental in most of the building and maintenance projects at Bodhinyana Monastery and at the emerging Hermit Hill property in Serpentine.

\section*{Creation Process}

Translated from the Pali. The primary source was the \textsanskrit{Mahāsaṅgīti} edition, with occasional reference to other Pali editions, especially the \textsanskrit{Chaṭṭha} \textsanskrit{Saṅgāyana} edition and the Pali Text Society edition. I cross-checked with I.B. Horner’s English translation, “The Book of the Discipline”, as well as Bhikkhu \textsanskrit{Ñāṇatusita}’s “A Translation and Analysis of the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha}” and Ajahn \textsanskrit{Ṭhānissaro}’s “Buddhist Monastic Code”.

\section*{The Translation}

This is the first complete translation of the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka} in English. The aim has been to produce a translation that is easy to read, clear, and accurate, and also modern in vocabulary and style.
