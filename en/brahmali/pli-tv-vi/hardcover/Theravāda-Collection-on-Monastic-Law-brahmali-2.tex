\scbyline{Bhikkhu Brahmali, 2024}

The present volume is the second of six, the total of which comprises a complete translation of the Pali Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka}, the Monastic Law, of the Theravada school of Buddhism. For a general introduction to the Monastic Law, see volume 1. In the present introduction, I will survey the contents of volume 2 and make observations of points of particular interest.

This volume contains the second and last part of the Bhikkhu-\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga}, “the Monks’ Analysis”, the first part of which is contained in volume 1. Whereas the first volume contains the heavy offenses of \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} and \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesa}}, also known as \textit{\textsanskrit{garukāpatti}}, the current volume contains the light offenses, or \textit{\textsanskrit{lahukāpatti}}. These offenses are divided into the following classes:

\begin{enumerate}%
\item The \textit{nissaggiya \textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} (NP), “the offenses entailing relinquishment and confession”%
\item The \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} (Pc), “the offenses entailing confession”%
\item The \textit{\textsanskrit{pāṭidesanīyas}} (Pd), “the offenses entailing acknowledgment”%
\item The \textit{sekhiyas} (Sk), “the rules of training”%
\item The \textit{\textsanskrit{adhikaraṇasamathadhammas}}, or just \textit{\textsanskrit{adhikaraṇasamathas}} (As), “the principles for settling legal issues”.%
\end{enumerate}

\section*{The \textit{nissaggiya \textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} (NP)}

The \textit{nissaggiya \textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} are offenses entailing relinquishment and confession. They concern cases where a monastic either acquires or uses a requisite in an inappropriate fashion, or acquires something altogether unallowable. The requisite in question then needs to be relinquished before the offense is confessed. There is no further penalty. A curious detail is that the relinquished requisites must be returned to the offender, except if the item is altogether unallowable for a monastic, as in the case of money, gold, or gems. The point of this largely ceremonial relinquishment might be to make the rule stick better in memory. Not returning a relinquished item is itself an offense. In total there are thirty such rules for the monks.

The majority of \textit{nissaggiya \textsanskrit{pācittiya}} rules, in total 23 out of 30, concern cloth, cloth requisites, or thread for such requisites. Of the remaining seven rules, there are two rules about bowls, one about medicinal tonics, one concerned with diverting requisites meant for the Sangha, one about money, and finally two about trading. In what follows I will briefly note a few points of interest drawn from the current chapter.

At \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np2/en/brahmali\#2.39.1}{Bu~NP~2} the rule includes the expression “except if the monks have agreed”, \textit{\textsanskrit{aññatra} bhikkhusammutiya}, which is then explained in the word commentary using the synonymous expression \textit{\textsanskrit{ṭhapetvā} \textsanskrit{bhikkhusammutiṁ}}. It is only in the origin story that this is specified as a legal procedure of one motion and one announcement. We find a similar situation in a number of other rules. This gives the impression that the “agreement of the monks” initially was an informal process that over time got formalized as a specific legal procedure. This also points to the word commentaries being older than the origin stories.

At \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np5/en/brahmali\#1.1.1}{Bu~NP~5} we find the touching case of a compassionate criminal who makes an offering to the nun \textsanskrit{Uppalavaṇṇā} by hanging some meat from a branch, announcing in her presence that this is offered to any monastic who sees it. She takes the meat, has it prepared, and takes it to the Buddha. At no point is the meat offered into her hands. One is left with a sense that giving to a monastic was quite informal in the earliest period. It is also noteworthy what she says to the monk \textsanskrit{Udāyī}, namely, that it is hard for women to get material support. Some things have not changed much since the time of the Buddha.

In the rule formulation to \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np7/en/brahmali\#1.31.1}{Bu~NP~7}, we find the phrase “that monk”, referring to the monk in the previous rule, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np6/en/brahmali\#2.18.1}{Bu~NP~6}. This sort of direct connection between the rules shows unmistakably that at an earlier time the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} must have existed as a separate text, presumably going back to a time when the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga} did not yet exist.\footnote{At present the two \textsanskrit{Pātimokkhas} of Theravada Buddhism are only found among the sub-commentaries, where they are included in a text called the \textsanskrit{Dvemātikāpāḷi}. It is interesting that it has the suffix \textit{\textsanskrit{pāḷi}}, which indicates its provenance as a Canonical text. At some point the two \textsanskrit{Pātimokkhas} must have been moved to their present position in the sub-commentaries. } \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np10/en/brahmali\#1.3.1}{Bu~NP~10}, the longest rule of the Bhikkhu-\textsanskrit{pātimokkha}, includes a full description of how to establish and use a fund set up for the benefit of a monastic, which makes it much more than just a training rule. \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np15/en/brahmali\#1.1.1}{Bu~NP~15} starts with the striking story of the monk Upasena who visits the Buddha while the latter is on retreat. It turns out that the local Sangha has laid down a rule that anyone who visits the Buddha commits a \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} offense. Upasena expresses his disapproval of this and is supported by the Buddha. This reinforces the message of the \textsanskrit{Mahāparinibbāna} Sutta that the Sangha should not add new rules or remove existing ones, but should practice according to what has been laid down by the Buddha (\href{https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato\#1.6.13}{DN~16:1.6.13}).

At \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np18/en/brahmali\#1.28.1}{Bu~NP~18} we find the rule against a monastic accepting gold or silver, which is then defined as money in the word commentary. This rule is significant because the Buddha elsewhere warns about the danger of money for a monastic (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd22/en/brahmali\#1.3.1}{Kd~22:1.3.1}–1.5.1). At \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np23/en/brahmali\#1.1.1}{Bu~NP~23}, we have the extraordinary story of Pilindavaccha who uses his psychic powers to turn a pad of grass into a golden garland and then does the same with the king’s house. The same story is found at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali\#15.1.1}{Kd~6}, in which Pilindavaccha appears a number of times. He also appears in a case study at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2/en/brahmali\#7.47.1}{Bu~Pj~2}. Interestingly, although he was clearly an inspiring monk one might expect to encounter in the four main \textsanskrit{Nikāyas}, he is not mentioned there at all except for a single and probably late occurrence at \href{https://suttacentral.net/an1.209%E2%80%93218/en/brahmali\#1.1}{AN~1.215}. This is yet another indication that much of the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka} does not belong to the earliest period of Buddhism.

\section*{The \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} (Pc)}

The \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}}, “the offenses entailing confession”, are the largest class of rules in the monks’ \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha}, numbering in total 92. There is no penalty for committing these offenses apart from the confession itself. The confession formula, which is found at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali\#27.1.8}{Kd~2:27.1.8}–27.1.14, involves recognizing that one has committed an offense and undertaking restraint for the future. The severity of committing a \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} offense is illustrated through a simile at \href{https://suttacentral.net/an4.244/en/sujato\#3.1}{AN~4.244}, which compares it to being struck on the head with a sack of ashes.\footnote{The Canonical text just says a sack of ashes, which the commentary says is used to strike one on the head. }

The \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} are classed as \textit{khuddaka}, that is, minor offenses, and are called by this name at the end of the chapter. This is interesting, for it sheds light on expressions such as the \textit{\textsanskrit{khuddānukhuddaka}},\footnote{For instance at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc72/en/brahmali\#1.20.1}{Bu~Pc~72}. } which must then be a reference to the \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} and perhaps other offenses of even lesser importance. The \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} chapter is divided into nine subchapters with ten rules each, except for the penultimate subchapter which has twelve.

The first subchapter begins with the fundamental moral rule against lying (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc1/en/brahmali\#1.20.1}{Bu~Pc~1}), followed by a rule against verbal abuse (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2/en/brahmali\#1.2.1}{Bu~Pc~2}), which includes a retelling of the \textsanskrit{Nandivisāla} \textsanskrit{Jātaka}, number 28 of that collection. The \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga} to this rule shows that at the time of the Buddha, or shortly thereafter, India was already a society divided by caste, name, and occupation. This rule is also an example of a tendency I mentioned earlier of monastic victims of misconduct being better protected by the Vinaya than lay victims. There is a full offense of \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} for abusing another monastic, but just \textit{\textsanskrit{dukkaṭa}} (an offense of wrong conduct) for abusing a lay person. The same difference in offense is also found for the next rule, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc3/en/brahmali\#2.3.4}{Bu~Pc~3}, as well as for \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc13/en/brahmali\#3.2.3.}{Bu~Pc~13} and elsewhere.

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc8/en/brahmali\#1.2.26.1}{Bu~Pc~8} is an notable rule that prohibits monastics from telling lay people about their own superhuman qualities, including deep meditations, deep insights, and psychic powers. According to the origin story, monks told lay people of their superhuman qualities in order to receive sufficient food during a famine. Although the \textit{suttas} regard psychic powers as a testimony to one’s spiritual development, they are mostly a private concern. For instance, the Buddha compares showing off psychic powers for the sake of material support to a sex worker showing her private parts for the sake of money (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali\#8.2.15}{Kd~15:8.2.15}–8.2.18). In the Kevaddha Sutta, the Buddha takes this one step further (\href{https://suttacentral.net/dn11/en/sujato\#5.7}{DN~11:5.7}). In the context of using psychic powers to strengthen people’s faith, he says that he detests and abhors them. This is very strong language coming from the Buddha, who normally tends to be understated. He explains his attitude by saying that people without confidence will simply dismiss such powers as a magic trick. The overall point seems to be that talking about any of these things to lay people tends to cheapen them, which is the opposite of what one should try to achieve.

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc10/en/brahmali\#1.16.1}{Bu~Pc~10} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc11/en/brahmali\#1.29.1}{Bu~Pc~11} prohibit a monastic from digging the earth or destroying vegetation. The origin stories to both rules tell of lay people complaining that monastics were destroying life with one sense faculty. In other words, the earth and plants were regarded by the general population, or at least some people, as having a rudimentary form of sentience. The Buddha seems to dismiss this as superstition, saying, “People regard the earth/trees as conscious”, but nevertheless lays down a rule, apparently to satisfy the lay people. Interestingly, the issue of whether plants, especially, are conscious is never finally resolved, for the Buddha never makes an explicit statement either way. What we can say, however, is that either action was considered a minor issue. The \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga} to both these rules allows monastics to give broad hints if they need a hole in the ground or vegetation removed. The remaining rules in the second subchapter mostly concern proper conduct in relation to dwellings and furniture.

Subchapter three concerns the relationship between monks and nuns. A significant aspect of this relationship is that the monks have a duty to give a half-monthly instruction to the nuns. To ensure the quality of this instruction, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21/en/brahmali\#1.44.1}{Bu~Pc~21} lays down that an instructing monk has to be appointed by the Sangha and meet a set of minimum standards, which include good moral conduct, detailed knowledge of both \textsanskrit{Pātimokkhas}, and 20 years of seniority. Most of the remaining rules in this subchapter prohibit various inappropriate interactions between monks and nuns, including being together in private.

Subchapter four is all about food. It is here that we find the rule that a monastic can only eat between dawn and noon, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc37/en/brahmali\#1.22.1}{Bu~Pc~37}, and that they cannot store food, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc38/en/brahmali\#1.18.1}{Bu~Pc~38}. Both of these rules are fundamental to how the monastic life works, in that they make it necessary for monastics and their lay supporters to have daily contact. \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39/en/brahmali\#2.10.1}{Bu~Pc~39} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-sk37/en/brahmali\#2.10.1}{Sk~37} prohibit a monastic from asking for specific foods. A monastic is supposed to be content with whatever they receive. The last rule of this subchapter prohibits a monastic from eating anything that has not been given.

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc44/en/brahmali\#1.14.1}{Bu~Pc~44} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc45/en/brahmali\#1.14.1}{Bu~Pc~45} prohibit a monastic from being alone with someone of the opposite gender, rules that can be surprisingly important to sustain the monastic life. \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc67/en/brahmali\#1.28.1}{Bu~Pc~67} is of the same sort. \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc47/en/brahmali\#1.4.27.1}{Bu~Pc~47}, which allows a monastic to ask a lay person for requisites if invited beforehand, is another ever-relevant rule that governs the relationship between monastics and lay people. The offense is incurred when the monastic goes beyond the limits of the invitation. \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc48/en/brahmali\#2.13.1}{Bu~Pc~48}–50 place strict limits on monastics’ visit to the military. This is in keeping with the fundamentally non-violent nature of Buddhism, especially monasticism.

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc51/en/brahmali\#1.1}{Bu~Pc~51} opens with the entertaining story of a monk fighting a battle with a dragon, the details of which are similar to the story of the Buddha at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali\#15.3.1}{Kd~1:15.3.1}–15.4.3. At a later time, the same monk becomes so drunk that he collapses and has to be carried back to the monastery by his fellow monastics. The Buddha remarks that this previously powerful monk would now be unable to fight even a lizard! He then lays down the rule against drinking alcohol. Not drinking alcohol is a fundamental aspect of the monastic life (\href{https://suttacentral.net/an4.50/en/sujato}{AN~4.50}).

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc61/en/brahmali\#1.16.1}{Bu~Pc~61} prohibits a monastic from killing living beings, another fundamental aspect of Buddhist morality. Apart from the present rule and \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} 3, there are several other rules that also concern the killing of living beings, such as \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc20/en/brahmali\#1.12.1}{Bu~Pc~20} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc62/en/brahmali\#1.11.1}{Bu~Pc~62}, and indirectly \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np11/en/brahmali\#1.23.1}{Bu~NP~11}. Other acts of physical violence are covered by rules such as \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc74/en/brahmali\#1.15.1}{Bu~Pc~74} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc75/en/brahmali\#1.15.1}{Bu~Pc~75}.

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc63/en/brahmali\#1.12.1}{Bu~Pc~63} is one among a number of rules that concern legal issues (\textit{\textsanskrit{adhikaraṇas}}) and their resolution through legal procedures (\textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghakamma}}), all of which are principal topics of the Khandhakas. Other rules that directly concern the \textit{\textsanskrit{adhikaraṇas}} and \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghakamma}} are \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc79/en/brahmali\#1.22.1}{Bu~Pc~79}–81. Many more rules use \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghakamma}} to fulfill their purpose, such as \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss10/en/brahmali\#1.3.16.1}{Bu~Ss~10}–13, the four rules that include the phrase “except if the monks have agreed”,\footnote{\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np2/en/brahmali\#2.39.1}{Bu~NP~2}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np14/en/brahmali\#2.39}{14}, and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np29/en/brahmali\#1.2.17}{29}, as well as \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc9/en/brahmali\#1.20.1}{Bu~Pc~9}. } and assorted other rules. As we will see in the introduction to the Khandhakas in volume 4, \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghakamma}} is fundamental to the workings of monasticism as an institution.

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc64/en/brahmali\#1.23.1}{Bu~Pc~64} prohibits a monk from concealing another monk’s grave offense. Monasticism is an honor system that relies on trust. If the trust is broken, the whole system starts to fall apart. For this reason, it is important that significantly bad behavior is rooted out as soon as possible. For the nuns, concealing a \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} offense is itself a \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6/en/brahmali\#1.23.1}{Bi~Pj~6}.

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65/en/brahmali\#1.53.1}{Bu~Pc~65} sets the age limit for the full ordination of men at 20. The offense is committed by the act of ordaining a man below this age. (I will discuss the rules for the ordination of women in the introduction to the Nuns’ Analysis in volume 3.) As one might expect, ordination is an important topic in the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka}, with the longest \textit{khandhaka}, Kd 1, devoted to it.

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc68/en/brahmali\#1.49.1}{Bu~Pc~68}–70 concern the wrong view that sexual intercourse is not an obstacle on the spiritual path. Such views are heavily censured in the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka}. The initial offense is one of confession under Bu Pc 68, but for anyone who refuses to relinquish such a view the final result is ejection from the Sangha (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd11/en/brahmali\#32.1.1}{Kd~11:32.1.1}). Again, it is striking how the Buddha’s view of sensuality is so at odds with the way it tends to be celebrated in regular society.

The origin story to \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83/en/brahmali\#1.3.56.1}{Bu~Pc~83}, the first rule of the ninth and last subchapter, includes a long section on the dangers of entering a royal compound, which is a parallel to \href{https://suttacentral.net/an10.45/en/sujato}{AN 10.45}. It is essentially a warning against getting too close to power, a very real problem for some monastics, both ancient and modern. \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc84/en/brahmali\#3.17.1}{Bu~Pc~84} prohibits a monastic from picking up valuables, which, besides money, precious metals, and gems, include anything people regard as valuable or useful. The only exception is safekeeping. This is one of only two instances where a monastic is allowed to pick up money, the other being if they have been chosen as a “discarder of money” under \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np18/en/brahmali\#2.36}{Bu~NP~18} or \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np19/en/brahmali\#2.46}{Bu~NP~19}. \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc85/en/brahmali\#4.9.1}{Bu~Pc~85} prohibits monks from entering an inhabited area at the wrong time, that is, any time after noon until the following dawn. This shows that monks in the early period lived exclusively outside of inhabited areas. The nuns, who were not permitted to live in the wilderness, do not have this rule.

The remainder of the rules in subchapter nine concern requisites that are inappropriate for monastics, including rules on the proper size for cloth requisites. It is here, especially, that we meet with the idea of \textit{sugata} measures. \textit{Sugata} is normally an epithet of the Buddha, meaning something like “the one who has gone to a good destination”, but here seems to be used in the sense of “standard” measures. See the Appendix I: Technical Terms for further discussion.

\section*{The \textit{\textsanskrit{pāṭidesanīyas}} (Pd)}

The next class of offenses is known as the \textit{\textsanskrit{pāṭidesanīyas}}, “offenses entailing acknowledgment”. These, too, are clearable by confession, but the formula to be used is different from that of the \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}}. The monks have four such offenses.

It is not clear why there are two separate classes of offenses both entailing confession, that is, \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} and \textit{\textsanskrit{pāṭidesanīyas}}. According to the similes at \href{https://suttacentral.net/an4.244/en/sujato\#4.1}{AN~4.244}, the committing of a \textit{\textsanskrit{pāṭidesanīya}} offense is equivalent to wearing black and submitting oneself to the wishes of a crowd. The committing a \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} offense, as we have seen, is compared to being beaten with a sack of ashes, and so it would seem that \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} offenses are regarded as the more serious. Still, it is hard to see that there is any systematic difference between the two classes. Perhaps the \textit{\textsanskrit{pāṭidesanīyas}} were an early class of offenses that was later abandoned as unnecessary, which may explain why there are so few of them. The unusual formula of confession might perhaps be a remnant from a time when the standard formula of confession had not yet been laid down. Yet, abolishing the class in toto was presumably not practical since the monks were already practicing the existing rules.

The first two of the four involve the nuns. \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pd1/en/brahmali\#1.35.1}{Bu~Pd~1} prohibits a monk from receiving almsfood from a nun within an inhabited area. Again, this shows how difficult it could be for women to find support in their practice of the monastic life. Here and elsewhere, such as \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np5/en/brahmali\#1.1.1}{Bu~NP~5}, the monks are required to be sensitive to the needs of the nuns. In confessing this offense, and also the last two \textit{\textsanskrit{pāṭidesanīyas}}, a monk is required to say that “I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”

\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pd2/en/brahmali\#1.15.1}{Bu~Pd~2} concerns nuns ordering lay people to give food to specific monks. The offense is incurred if the monks do nothing to stop such a nun. The confession formula to this rule is unique and involves the monks confessing together: “We have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. We acknowledge it.” \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pd3/en/brahmali\#3.15.1}{Bu~Pd~3} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pd4/en/brahmali\#2.12.1}{Bu~Pd~4} concern unusual circumstances that are unlikely to occur in practice.

\section*{The \textit{sekhiyas} (Sk)}

The second last class of offenses is known as the \textit{sekhiyas}, “rules of training”. There is no automatic offense for breaking these rules, but an offense of \textit{\textsanskrit{dukkaṭa}} if broken out of disrespect. There are 75 such rules. They are the same for the monks and the nuns.

The \textit{sekhiyas} are mostly about etiquette and as such about what was considered socially appropriate in India 2,500 years ago. For this reason, it is convenient that these rules are only offended against when broken out of disrespect. In practice, this means that circumstances such as the prevailing social norms may be taken into account in deciding whether a rule needs to be followed or not. An obvious example is \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-sk70/en/brahmali\#1.3.1}{Sk~70}, which prohibits a monastic from teaching while standing if the audience is sitting. This rule does not fit the modern practice of speakers standing in the presence of their audience, as in the case of a talk given in an auditorium. In such circumstances one can reasonably argue that this \textit{sekhiya} rule does not apply. Similar considerations apply for a large number of these rules. It follows that the \textit{sekhiyas} have a lower status than the other classes of rules. It is no doubt for this reason that it was considered acceptable to add new \textit{sekhiyas} to the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} after the time of the Buddha, as we have discussed in the introduction to volume 1. Nevertheless, even these added rules often draw on material found elsewhere in the Vinaya or the Suttas, and as such may well stem from the earliest period.

That the \textit{sekhiyas} draw on material that exists elsewhere is especially obvious in the case of 55 of the first 56 \textit{sekhiyas}, which are found in similar form in Kd 18.\footnote{See \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd18/en/brahmali\#4.3.1}{Kd~18:4.3.1}–4.6.8. The missing rule is \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-sk2/en/brahmali\#1.3.1}{Sk~2}. } The question then arises of where they are likely to have appeared first. Normally, in the Khandhakas, when someone is depicted as breaking a \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} rule, the rule is simply referred to, which means one needs to look it up in the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga}. This is not the case for these \textit{sekhiya} rules, which suggests they did not exist in the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga} at the time they were laid down in Kd 18. Moreover, the wording in Kd 18 is simpler than the wording in the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga}, which includes the refrain \textit{\textsanskrit{sikkhā} \textsanskrit{karaṇīyā}}, “a training to be done”, for every \textit{sekhiya}. This too suggests a movement from the Khandhakas to the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga}. Lastly, most of the \textit{sekhiya} rules have artificially created origin stories, with all of them except three featuring the group of six monks. This suggests that they were not really independent rules with separate origin stories, but rather part of a general description of right conduct with a single origin story, which is what we find in the Khandhakas (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd18/en/brahmali\#4.2.1}{Kd~18:4.2.1}). And indeed, this single origin story does feature the group of six monks, which then, presumably, got distributed to all the origin stories of \textit{sekhiyas} 1–56, with the exception of \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-sk51/en/brahmali\#1.1}{Sk~51}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-sk55/en/brahmali\#1.1}{Sk~55}, and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-sk56/en/brahmali\#1.1}{Sk~56}.

A brief review of the correspondence tables in Pachow’s comparative study of the Bhikkhu-\textsanskrit{pātimokkha} suggests to me that the rules of the different schools are more closely aligned for the last 19 \textit{sekhiyas} than for the first 56. This is especially so if we remove \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-sk65/en/brahmali\#1.3.1}{Sk~65} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-sk68/en/brahmali\#1.3.1}{Sk~68}, which are not attested in many of the non-Pali schools.\footnote{Pachow, 1955, appendix IV, pp. 15–22. I am taking the Pali rules as the baseline. } If this is correct, and given the possibility that many of the \textit{sekhiyas} may have been moved from the Khandhakas to the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga}, it may be that the remaining 17 rules, more or less, are the original common core around which the \textit{sekhiyas} developed as a chapter. A number of these rules do in fact have a word commentary, which is rare among the \textit{sekhiyas}. This too suggests that they developed as independent rules and were not merely transplanted from elsewhere.

As to the content of the \textit{sekhiyas}, the first 26 concern the proper behavior when walking for alms and sitting in inhabited areas. The next 30 rules lay down the proper conduct and etiquette in relation to eating. We then have 16 rules on not teaching anyone not showing appropriate respect. The last three rules are about spitting and toilet etiquette.

Despite the general homogeneity in the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga} material of the \textit{sekhiyas}, there are occasional points of interest. At \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-sk51/en/brahmali\#1.1}{Sk~51}, a monk makes a joke when he hears the slurping of his fellow monks, upon which the Buddha lays down a \textit{\textsanskrit{dukkaṭa}} offense for joking about the Buddha, Dhamma, or Sangha. This is not, however, a general rule against joking, with the Buddha himself occasionally making humorous remarks. In the origin story to \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-sk69/en/brahmali\#1.12.1}{Sk~69}, we find a \textsanskrit{Jātaka} story, the Chavaka \textsanskrit{Jātaka}, number 309 of that collection.

\section*{The \textit{\textsanskrit{adhikaraṇasamathadhammas}} (As)}

The final class consists of the \textit{\textsanskrit{adhikaraṇasamathadhammas}}, “the principles for settling legal issues”. As I have pointed out in the introduction to volume 1, these principles stand out as not fitting very well with the other rules of the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha}, which are all rules about individual conduct. These seven principles, in contrast, are regulations to be used by the Sangha to resolve legal issues that may arise in the monastic community.

It is not just the nature of these principles that are different from the rest of the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} rules, but also their presentation. There is virtually no \textit{\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga}} material, with the seven principles presented as little more than seven key words, not very different from an index. It is impossible to understand even the meaning of these principles from these key words alone, let alone how they are to be applied to resolve legal issues. For this reason, we are compelled to assume that this section must have been much longer earlier on, with the explanatory \textit{\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga}} material eventually moved as the Vinaya expanded and became unwieldy.

In the earliest period, this explanatory material may have looked like the exposition we now find in the \textsanskrit{Sāmagāma} Sutta, where we see a succinct explanation of these principles.\footnote{\href{https://suttacentral.net/mn104/en/sujato\#12.1}{MN~104:12.1}–20.13. } In addition to this, the \textit{\textsanskrit{adhikaraṇasamathas}} may have been the container for the various \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghakammas}} that must have been laid down early on, such as the observance-day ceremony, the \textit{uposatha}, and the ordination ceremony. Over time, as the Vinaya developed, it would have been impractical to keep all this material as part of the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} or even the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga}. A whole new section was then created, which became the Khandhakas. The material specific to the \textit{\textsanskrit{adhikaraṇasamathas}} was collected in a purpose-made chapter, now known as the Samatha-kkhandhaka, that is, the Chapter on the Settling of Legal issues (Kd 14). Other material, such as the \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghakammas}}, was distributed, as appropriate, in specially created chapters. Over time, more material would have been added. The end result of this process is the twenty-two Khandhakas as we have them now. I will discuss this process further in my introduction to part I of the Khandhakas in volume 4.

We may speculate as to why a mere list of these principles was retained in the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha}. It could be that the number of rules was regarded as fixed and should not be changed. Or it could be that this bridge between the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} and the Khandhakas was considered useful. Whatever the case may be, we now have a reasonable explanation for why we only have a stub of these principles left in the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} itself.

Further discussion of the seven \textit{\textsanskrit{adhikaraṇasamathas}} is found in the introduction to part II of the Khandhakas in volume 5.

Venerables,\marginnote{0.6} these thirty rules on relinquishment and confession come up for recitation. 

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Vesālī} at the Gotamaka Shrine,\footnote{In the heading above, and also in the heading to \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np3/en/brahmali\#1.1.1}{Bu NP 3:1.1.1} (and also at the end of each of these rules), I translate \textit{kathina} as “robe season” rather than “robe-making ceremony”, since this is the contextual meaning in these rules. For further discussion of the meaning of \textit{kathina}, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } he allowed the three robes for the monks. When they heard about this, the monks from the group of six went to the village in one set of three robes, stayed in the monastery in another set, and went to bathe in yet another set. The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can the monks from the group of six keep extra robes?” 

After\marginnote{1.6} rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.8} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.9} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk keeps an extra robe, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.14} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{2.1.1} afterwards Venerable Ānanda was offered an extra robe.\footnote{“Was offered” renders \textit{uppanna}. This word, which literally means “arisen”, varies slightly in meaning dependent on the context. Often it refers to a requisite that has just been given to the Sangha or an individual monastic. I then render \textit{uppanna} as “given”. Occasionally however, such as here, this does not fit the context, because Ānanda would have incurred a \textit{nissaggiya \textsanskrit{pācittiya}} offense had he received the robe. In other words, here \textit{uppanna} happens first, and only afterwards is the robe given. The meaning, then, must be that Ānanda had been given an offer or a promise of a robe, but had not yet received it. In this sense the robe had “become available” to him. The most common way for a requisite to become available to a monastic is that an offer is made. I translate accordingly. See also DOP for this meaning of \textit{uppanna}. } He wanted to give it to Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} who was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāketa}. Knowing that the Buddha had laid down a rule against having extra robes, Ānanda thought, “What should I do now?” He told the Buddha, who said, “How long is it, Ānanda, before \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} returns?” 

“Nine\marginnote{2.13} or ten days.” 

Soon\marginnote{2.14} afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Monks, you should keep an extra robe for ten days at the most. And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘When his robe is finished and the robe season has ended, a monk should keep an extra robe for ten days at the most. If he keeps it longer than that, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’” }

\subsection*{Definitions }

\begin{description}%
\item[When his robe is finished: ] the monk has made a robe; or the robe-cloth has been lost, destroyed, or burned; or his expectation of receiving further robe-cloth is disappointed.\footnote{This refers to robe-cloth received during the robe season. For details see \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd7/en/brahmali\#1.7.3}{Kd 7:1.7.3}–13.2.7. “Finished” refers to the monk either having made a robe or having given up on making a robe. } %
\item[The robe season has ended: ] it has ended according to one of the eight key phrases or the Sangha has ended it.\footnote{For an explanation of this, see \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd7/en/brahmali\#1.7.3}{Kd 7:1.7.3}–12.1.37. } %
\item[For ten days at the most: ] it should be kept ten days at a maximum. %
\item[An extra robe: ] it has not been determined nor assigned to another.\footnote{For an explanation of the idea of \textit{\textsanskrit{vikappanā}}, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } %
\item[Robe: ] one of the six kinds of robe-cloth, but not smaller than what can be assigned to another.\footnote{The six are linen, cotton, silk, wool, sunn hemp, and hemp, see \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali\#3.1.6}{Kd 8:3.1.6}. According to \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali\#21.1.4}{Kd 8:21.1.4}, the size referred to here is no smaller than 8 by 4 \textit{\textsanskrit{sugataṅgula}}, “standard fingerbreadths”. For a discussion of \textit{\textsanskrit{sugataṅgula}} and \textit{sugata}, see Appendix of Technical Terms. For the rendering of \textit{\textsanskrit{cīvara}} as “robe-cloth”, see the same appendix. } %
\item[If he keeps it longer than that, it becomes subject to relinquishment:\footnote{At first sight this looks like a phrase from the rule to be defined, but, interestingly, it is not actually identical with the phrasing of the rule. } ] it becomes subject to relinquishment at dawn on the eleventh day.\footnote{According to the commentary this means the tenth dawn after one received the robe(-cloth). Sp 1.462: \textit{Tattha \textsanskrit{ekādase} \textsanskrit{aruṇuggamaneti} ettha \textsanskrit{yaṁ} \textsanskrit{divasaṁ} \textsanskrit{cīvaraṁ} \textsanskrit{uppannaṁ} tassa yo \textsanskrit{aruṇo}, so uppannadivasanissito, \textsanskrit{tasmā} \textsanskrit{cīvaruppādadivasaena} \textsanskrit{saddhiṁ} \textsanskrit{ekādase} \textsanskrit{aruṇuggamane} \textsanskrit{nissaggiyaṁ} \textsanskrit{hotīti} \textsanskrit{veditabbaṁ}}, “In this case ‘at dawn on the eleventh day’: here, the dawn of the day that the robe was given depends on the day of giving, and therefore it is to be understood that it is subject to relinquishment on the eleventh dawn including the day that the robe was given.” } %
\end{description}

The\marginnote{3.2.3} robe-cloth should be relinquished to a sangha, a group, or an individual. “And, monks, it should be relinquished like this. After approaching the Sangha, that monk should arrange his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: 

‘Venerables,\marginnote{3.2.6} this robe-cloth, which I have kept over ten days, is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ 

After\marginnote{3.2.8} relinquishing it, he should confess the offense. The confession should be received by a competent and capable monk. The relinquished robe-cloth is then to be given back: 

‘Please,\marginnote{3.2.11} venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. This robe-cloth, which was to be relinquished by monk so-and-so, has been relinquished to the Sangha. If the Sangha is ready, it should give this robe-cloth back to monk so-and-so.’ 

Or:\marginnote{3.2.14} after approaching several monks, that monk should arrange his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say:\footnote{“Several” renders \textit{sambahula}.  See Appendix of Technical Terms for a discussion. } 

‘Venerables,\marginnote{3.2.15} this robe-cloth, which I have kept over ten days, is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to you.’ 

After\marginnote{3.2.17} relinquishing it, he should confess the offense. The confession should be received by a competent and capable monk. The relinquished robe-cloth is then to be given back: 

‘Please,\marginnote{3.2.20} venerables, I ask you to listen. This robe-cloth, which was to be relinquished by monk so-and-so, has been relinquished to you. If the venerables are ready, you should give this robe-cloth back to monk so-and-so.’ 

Or:\marginnote{3.2.23} after approaching a single monk, that monk should arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: 

‘This\marginnote{3.2.24} robe-cloth, which I have kept over ten days, is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to you.’ 

After\marginnote{3.2.26} relinquishing it, he should confess the offense. The confession should be received by that monk. The relinquished robe-cloth is then to be given back: 

‘I\marginnote{3.2.29} give this robe-cloth back to you.’” 

\subsection*{Permutations }

If\marginnote{4.1} it is more than ten days and he perceives it as more, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If it is more than ten days, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If it is more than ten days, but he perceives it as less, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 

If\marginnote{4.4} it has not been determined, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If it has not been assigned to another, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If it has not been given away, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If it has not been lost, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If it has not been destroyed, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If it has not been burned, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If it has not been stolen, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 

If\marginnote{4.11} he uses robe-cloth that should be relinquished without first relinquishing it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is less than ten days, but he perceives it as more, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is less than ten days, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is less than ten days and he perceives it as less, there is no offense. 

\subsection*{Non-offenses }

There\marginnote{4.15.1} is no offense: if within ten days it has been determined, assigned to another, given away, lost, destroyed, burned, stolen, or taken on trust;\footnote{“Taken on trust” refers to a situation where you have an agreement with a close friend that you may take their belongings on trust. The conditions for taking on trust are set out at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali\#19.1.5}{Kd 8:19.1.5}. } if he is insane; if he is the first offender. 

Soon\marginnote{5.1} afterwards the monks from the group of six did not give back relinquished robe-cloth. They told the Buddha. 

\scrule{“Monks, relinquished robe-cloth should be given back. If you don’t give it back, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” }

\scendsutta{The training rule on the robe season, the first, is finished. }

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time the monks stored one of their robes with other monks and then left to wander the country in a sarong and an upper robe. Because they were stored for a long time, the robes became moldy. The monks put them out in the sun. 

Then,\marginnote{1.5} while walking about the dwellings, Venerable Ānanda noticed that the monks were sunning those robes. He asked them, “Whose moldy robes are these?” And they told him what had happened. Venerable Ānanda complained and criticized them, “How can those monks store a robe with other monks and then leave to wander the country in a sarong and an upper robe?” 

After\marginnote{1.11} rebuking those monks in many ways, Venerable Ānanda told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that there are monks who do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.13} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.14} Buddha rebuked them … “How can those foolish men do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘When his robe is finished and the robe season has ended, if a monk stays apart from his three robes even for a single day, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.19} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

At\marginnote{2.1} one time a certain monk at \textsanskrit{Kosambī} was sick. His relatives sent him a message, saying, “Come, venerable, we’ll nurse you.” The monks urged him to go, but he said, “The Buddha has laid down a training rule that you can’t be apart from your three robes. Now because I’m sick, I’m unable to travel with my three robes. So I can’t go.” 

They\marginnote{2.11} told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to give permission to a sick monk to stay apart from his three robes. }

And\marginnote{2.14} it should be given like this. After approaching the Sangha, the sick monk should arrange his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, ‘Venerables, I’m sick. I’m unable to travel with my three robes. I ask the Sangha for permission to stay apart from my three robes.’ And he should ask a second and a third time. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 

‘Please,\marginnote{2.22} venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The monk so-and-so is sick. He is unable to travel with his three robes. He is asking the Sangha for permission to stay apart from his three robes. If the Sangha is ready, it should give permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes. This is the motion. 

Please,\marginnote{2.28} venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The monk so-and-so is sick. He is unable to travel with his three robes. He is asking the Sangha for permission to stay apart from his three robes. The Sangha gives permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes. Any monk who approves of giving permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. 

The\marginnote{2.35} Sangha has given permission to monk so-and-so to stay apart from his three robes. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’ 

And\marginnote{2.38} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘When his robe is finished and the robe season has ended, if a monk stays apart from his three robes even for a single day, except if the monks have agreed, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’” }

\paragraph*{Summary }

An\marginnote{3.2.1} inhabited area may have a single access or many;\footnote{For the rendering of \textit{\textsanskrit{upacāra}} as “access” and \textit{\textsanskrit{gāma}} as “inhabited area”, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } a house may have a single access or many; a storehouse may have a single access or many; a watchtower may have a single access or many; a stilt house may have a single access or many;\footnote{I have here included three kinds of building—the \textit{\textsanskrit{māḷa}}, the \textit{\textsanskrit{pāsāda}}, and the \textit{hammiya}—into one category, “stilt house”. See below for further discussion. } a boat may have a single access or many; a caravan may have a single access or many; a field may have a single access or many; a threshing floor may have a single access or many; a monastery may have a single access or many; a dwelling may have a single access or many; the foot of a tree may have a single access or many; out-in-the-open may have a single access or many. 

\paragraph*{Exposition }

\subparagraph*{An inhabited area }

“An\marginnote{3.3.1} inhabited area with a single access” refers to the following. 

An\marginnote{3.3.2} enclosed inhabited area belonging to one clan: if the robe is kept within the inhabited area, one must stay within the inhabited area. An unenclosed inhabited area belonging to one clan: one must stay in the house where the robe is kept, or not go beyond arm’s reach of the house.\footnote{“Of the house” is added from the commentary. Sp 1.477: \textit{\textsanskrit{Hatthapāsā} \textsanskrit{vā} na vijahitabbanti atha \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{taṁ} \textsanskrit{gharaṁ} samantato \textsanskrit{hatthapāsā} na \textsanskrit{vijahitabbaṁ}}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Hatthapāsā} \textsanskrit{vā} na vijahitabbanti}: or one is not to go beyond arm’s reach from any point of that house.” Without this explanation it is hard to make out whether the arm’s reach is from the house or from the robe. In each instance below I have added the respective commentarial explanation, so as to make it clear what the arm’s reach relates to. } 

An\marginnote{3.3.4} enclosed inhabited area belonging to many clans: if the robe is kept in a house, one must stay in that house, in the public meeting hall, or at the gateway to the inhabited area, or not go beyond arm’s reach of the public meeting hall or the gateway.\footnote{Sp 1.479: \textit{Tattha \textsanskrit{saddasaṅghaṭṭanena} \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{janasambādhena} \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{vasituṁ} asakkontena \textsanskrit{sabhāye} \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{vatthabbaṁ} \textsanskrit{nagaradvāramūle} \textsanskrit{vā}.

Gharassa pana \textsanskrit{cīvarassa} \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{hatthapāse} vattabbameva natthi}, “If one is unable to stay there because of the impact of noise or being confined by people, one should stay in the public meeting hall or at the main gateway to the town. If one is also unable to stay there, one should stay in a comfortable place wherever. Then, before dawn, one should go there, or one should not go beyond arm’s reach of that meeting hall or of the main gateway to the town. But there is no staying within arm’s reach of the house or the robe.” } If one puts aside the robe within arm’s reach while going to the public meeting hall, one must stay in the public meeting hall, or at the gateway to the inhabited area, or not go beyond arm’s reach of either.\footnote{Sp 1.479: \textit{Purimanayeneva \textsanskrit{sabhāye} \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{vatthabbaṁ} \textsanskrit{dvāramūle} \textsanskrit{vā}, \textsanskrit{hatthapāsā} \textsanskrit{vā} na \textsanskrit{vijahitabbaṁ}}, “According to the previous method, one should stay in the meeting hall or at the main gateway, or not go beyond arm’s reach of either.” } If the robe is kept in the public meeting hall, one must stay in the public meeting hall, or at the gateway to the inhabited area, or not go beyond arm’s reach of either.\footnote{Sp 1.479: \textit{\textsanskrit{Sabhāye} \textsanskrit{nikkhipitvā} pana \textsanskrit{sabhāye} \textsanskrit{vā} tassa sammukhe \textsanskrit{nagaradvāramūle} \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{tesaṁyeva} \textsanskrit{hatthapāse} \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{aruṇaṁ} \textsanskrit{uṭṭhāpetabbaṁ}}, “But having put it aside in the public meeting hall, dawn should arrive (while one is) in the meeting hall, in its presence, at the main gateway to the town, or within arm’s reach of these.” } An unenclosed inhabited area belonging to many clans: one must stay in the house where the robe is kept, or not go beyond arm’s reach of the house. 

\subparagraph*{A house }

An\marginnote{3.4.1} enclosed house belonging to one clan and having many rooms: if the robe is kept in the house, one must stay within the house.

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, a monk had been given robe-cloth outside the robe season. While he was making the robe, he realized there was not enough cloth. Lifting it up, he smoothed it out again and again.\footnote{Sp 1.497: \textit{Tattha \textsanskrit{ussāpetvā} \textsanskrit{punappunaṁ} \textsanskrit{vimajjatīti} “\textsanskrit{valīsu} \textsanskrit{naṭṭhāsu} \textsanskrit{idaṁ} \textsanskrit{mahantaṁ} \textsanskrit{bhavissatī}”ti \textsanskrit{maññamāno} udakena \textsanskrit{siñcitvā} \textsanskrit{pādehi} \textsanskrit{akkamitvā} hatthehi \textsanskrit{ussāpetvā} \textsanskrit{ukkhipitvā} \textsanskrit{piṭṭhiyaṁ} \textsanskrit{ghaṁsati}, \textsanskrit{taṁ} \textsanskrit{ātape} \textsanskrit{sukkhaṁ} \textsanskrit{paṭhamappamāṇameva} hoti. So punapi \textsanskrit{tathā} karoti}, “In regard to this \textit{\textsanskrit{ussāpetvā} \textsanskrit{punappunaṁ} vimajjati} means: thinking, ‘When the wrinkles disappear, it will be larger,’ he would sprinkle it with water, step on it with his feet, and then lifting and holding it up with his hands, he would rub it against his back. But when dried in the sun, it returned to its initial size. He would then do it again.” } 

While\marginnote{1.1.5} walking about the dwellings, the Buddha saw that monk acting in this way. He went up to him and said, “What are you doing, monk?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{1.1.8} I’ve been given this out-of-season robe-cloth, but it’s not enough to make a robe. That’s why I lift it up and smooth it out again and again.” 

“Are\marginnote{1.1.11} you expecting to receive more cloth?” 

“I\marginnote{1.1.12} am.” 

Soon\marginnote{1.1.13} afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to keep out-of-season robe-cloth if you are expecting to receive more.” }

When\marginnote{1.2.1} they heard about this, some monks kept out-of-season robe-cloth for more than a month,  keeping them in bundles on a bamboo robe rack.  While walking about the dwellings, Venerable Ānanda saw that robe-cloth,  and he asked the monks,  “Whose cloth is this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.3.1} our out-of-season robe-cloth, which we’re keeping because we’re expecting more.” 

“But\marginnote{1.3.2} how long have you kept it?” 

“More\marginnote{1.3.3} than a month.” 

Venerable\marginnote{1.3.4} Ānanda complained and criticized them, “How can these monks keep out-of-season robe-cloth for more than a month?” 

After\marginnote{1.3.6} rebuking those monks in many ways, Venerable Ānanda told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that there are monks who do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.3.8} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.3.9} Buddha rebuked them … “How can those foolish men keep out-of-season robe-cloth for more than a month? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘When his robe is finished and the robe season has ended, if out-of-season robe-cloth is offered to a monk, he may receive it if he wishes. If he receives it, he should quickly make a robe. If there is not enough cloth, but he is expecting more, he should keep it at most one month to make up the lack. If he keeps it longer than that, then even if he expects more cloth, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’” }

The way this works, it seems, is that the day on which the cloth was received counts as one. I do the equivalent adjustment for each case below. See also the definition of ten days at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np1/en/brahmali\#3.2.2}{Bu NP 1:3.2.2}, where the eleventh dawn means the tenth dawn after one received the cloth. } If he is given the expected robe-cloth two days after … three days after … eighteen days after … … nineteen days after he was given the original robe-cloth, it must be made into a robe within ten days.

If he is given the expected robe-cloth twenty-nine days after he was given the original robe-cloth, it must be determined, assigned to another, or given away on that very day.\footnote{Again, in the Pali idiom, \textit{\textsanskrit{tiṁse} uppanne}, literally, “given thirty days ago”, actually means given twenty-nine days ago. } If he does not determine it, assign it to another, or give it away, it becomes subject to relinquishment at dawn on the thirtieth day.

The\marginnote{2.2.33} robe-cloth should be relinquished to a sangha, a group, or an individual. “And, monks, it should be relinquished like this. (To be expanded as in \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np1\#3.2.5}{Bu NP 1:3.2.5}–3.2.29, with appropriate substitutions.) 

‘Venerables,\marginnote{2.2.36} this out-of-season robe-cloth, which I have kept for more than a month, is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.’ … the Sangha should give … you should give … ‘I give this robe-cloth back to you.’” 

If\marginnote{2.2.41} he is given the expected robe-cloth, but it is different from the robe-cloth originally given to him, and there are days remaining, he does not have to make a robe if he does not want to.

If it is more than a month, but he perceives it as less, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. 

If\marginnote{2.3.4} it has not been determined, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If it has not been assigned to another, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.\footnote{For an explanation of the idea of \textit{\textsanskrit{vikappanā}}, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } If it has not been given away, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If it has not been lost, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If it has not been destroyed, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. If it has not been burned, but he perceives that it has, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, Venerable \textsanskrit{Udāyī}’s ex-wife became a nun. She frequently visited \textsanskrit{Udāyī}, and he frequently visited her. And \textsanskrit{Udāyī} shared his meals with that nun. 

One\marginnote{1.6} morning \textsanskrit{Udāyī} robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to her. He then uncovered his genitals in front of her and sat down on a seat. She too uncovered her genitals in front of him and sat down on a seat. Lustfully staring at her genitals, he emitted semen. 

He\marginnote{1.9} then said to that nun: “Sister, get some water. I’ll wash the robe.” 

“Give\marginnote{1.11} it to me, venerable, I’ll wash it.” 

She\marginnote{1.12} then took some of the semen in her mouth and inserted some into her vagina. Because of that she became pregnant. The nuns said, “This nun doesn’t abstain from sex. She’s pregnant.” 

She\marginnote{1.16} said, “Venerables, I do abstain from sex,” and she told them what had happened. 

The\marginnote{1.17} nuns complained and criticized \textsanskrit{Udāyī}, “How could Venerable \textsanskrit{Udāyī} get a nun to wash a used robe?” They then told the monks. The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How could Venerable \textsanskrit{Udāyī} get a nun to wash a used robe?” 

After\marginnote{1.22} rebuking him in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned \textsanskrit{Udāyī}: “Is it true, \textsanskrit{Udāyī}, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.24} true, sir.” 

“Is\marginnote{1.25} she a relative of yours?” 

“No.”\marginnote{1.26} 

“Foolish\marginnote{1.27} man, a man and a woman who are unrelated don’t know what’s appropriate and inappropriate, what’s inspiring and uninspiring, in dealing with each other. And still you did this. This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} in the Bamboo Grove, the nun \textsanskrit{Uppalavaṇṇā} was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. One morning she robed up, took her bowl and robe, and entered \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} to collect almsfood. When she had completed her almsround, eaten her meal, and returned, she went to the Blind Men’s Grove where she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day’s meditation. 

Just\marginnote{1.1.6} then some bandits who had stolen and slaughtered a cow were taking the meat to the Blind Men’s Grove. The head bandit saw \textsanskrit{Uppalavaṇṇā} sitting at the foot of that tree. He thought, “If my sons and brothers see this nun, they’ll harass her,” and he took a different path. Soon afterwards when the meat was cooked, he took the best part, tied it up with a palm-leaf wrap, hung it from a tree not far from \textsanskrit{Uppalavaṇṇā}, and said, “Whatever ascetic or brahmin sees this gift, please take it.” And he left. 

\textsanskrit{Uppalavaṇṇā}\marginnote{1.1.13} had just come out from the stillness of meditation when she heard the head bandit making that statement. She took the meat and returned to her dwelling place. The following morning she prepared the meat and made it into a bundle with her upper robe. She then rose into the air and landed in the Bamboo Grove. 

When\marginnote{1.2.1} she arrived, the Buddha had already gone to the village for alms, but Venerable \textsanskrit{Udāyī} had been left behind to look after the dwellings. \textsanskrit{Uppalavaṇṇā} approached \textsanskrit{Udāyī} and said, “Sir, where’s the Buddha?” 

“He’s\marginnote{1.2.5} gone to the village for alms.” 

“Please\marginnote{1.2.6} give this meat to the Buddha.” 

“You’ll\marginnote{1.2.7} please the Buddha with that meat. If you give me your sarong, you’ll please me too.” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.2.9} hard for women to get material support, and this is one of my five robes. I don’t have another. I can’t give it away.” 

“Sister,\marginnote{1.2.11} just as a man giving an elephant might decorate it with a girdle, so should you, when giving meat to the Buddha, decorate me with your sarong.” 

Being\marginnote{1.2.13} pressured by \textsanskrit{Udāyī}, \textsanskrit{Uppalavaṇṇā} gave him her sarong and then returned to her dwelling place. The nuns who received \textsanskrit{Uppalavaṇṇā}’s bowl and robe asked her where her sarong was. And she told them what had happened. The nuns complained and criticized \textsanskrit{Udāyī}, “How could Venerable \textsanskrit{Udāyī} receive a robe from a nun? It’s hard for women to get material support.” 

The\marginnote{1.2.19} nuns told the monks. The monks of few desires complained and criticized \textsanskrit{Udāyī}, “How could Venerable \textsanskrit{Udāyī} receive a robe from a nun?” 

After\marginnote{1.2.22} rebuking him in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned \textsanskrit{Udāyī}: “Is it true, \textsanskrit{Udāyī}, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.2.24} true, sir.” 

“Is\marginnote{1.2.25} she a relative of yours?” 

“No.”\marginnote{1.2.26} 

“Foolish\marginnote{1.2.27} man, a man and a woman who are unrelated don’t know what’s appropriate and inappropriate, what’s good and bad, in dealing with each other. And still you did this. This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk receives a robe directly from an unrelated nun, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.2.32} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Then,\marginnote{2.1} being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not receive robes from nuns even in exchange. The nuns complained and criticized them, “How can they not receive robes from us in exchange?” 

The\marginnote{2.4} monks heard the criticism of those nuns and they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to receive things in exchange from five kinds of people: monks, nuns, trainee nuns, novice monks, and novice nuns. }

And\marginnote{2.9} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time Venerable Upananda the Sakyan was skilled at teaching. On one occasion the son of a wealthy merchant went to Upananda, bowed, and sat down. And Upananda instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching. Afterwards that merchant’s son said to Upananda: 

“Venerable,\marginnote{1.1.6} please tell me what you need. I can give you robe-cloth, almsfood, a dwelling, and medicinal supplies.” 

“If\marginnote{1.1.8} you wish to give me something, give me one of your wrap garments.” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.1.9} shameful, venerable, for a gentleman to walk around in only one wrap. Please wait until I get back home. I’ll send you this wrap or a better one.” 

A\marginnote{1.1.12} second time and a third time Upananda said the same thing to that merchant’s son, and he got the same reply. He then said, “What’s the point of inviting me if you don’t want to give?” 

Being\marginnote{1.1.19} pressured by Upananda, that merchant’s son gave him one of his wraps and left. People asked him why he was walking around in only one wrap, and he told them what had happened. People complained and criticized him, “These Sakyan monastics have great desires. They’re not content. Even to make them an appropriate offer isn’t easy. How could they take his wrap when the merchant’s son was making an appropriate offer?” 

The\marginnote{1.2.7} monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda, “How could Venerable Upananda ask the merchant’s son for a robe?” 

After\marginnote{1.2.10} rebuking him in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Upananda: “Is it true, Upananda, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.2.12} true, sir.” 

“Is\marginnote{1.2.13} he a relative of yours?” 

“No.”\marginnote{1.2.14} 

“Foolish\marginnote{1.2.15} man, people who are unrelated don’t know what’s appropriate and inappropriate, what’s good and bad, in dealing with each other. And still you did this. This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk asks an unrelated male or female householder for a robe, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.2.20} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards a number of monks who were traveling from \textsanskrit{Sāketa} to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} were robbed by bandits. Knowing that the Buddha had laid down this training rule and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not ask for robes. As a consequence, they walked naked to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}, where they bowed down to the monks. The monks there said, “These \textsanskrit{Ājīvaka} ascetics are good people, as they bow down to the monks.” 

“We’re\marginnote{2.5} not \textsanskrit{Ājīvakas}! We’re monks!” 

The\marginnote{2.6} monks asked Venerable \textsanskrit{Upāli} to examine them. 

When\marginnote{2.7} the naked monks told him what had happened, \textsanskrit{Upāli} said to the monks, “They are monks. Please give them robes.” 

The\marginnote{2.8} monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can monks go naked? Shouldn’t they have covered up with grass and leaves?” 

After\marginnote{2.11} rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, if a monk’s robes are stolen or lost, I allow him to ask an unrelated householder for robes. At the first monastery where he arrives, if the Sangha has a communal robe, a bedspread, a floor cover, or a mattress cover, he should take that and put it on, thinking, ‘When I get a robe, I’ll return it.’\footnote{“A communal robe” renders \textit{\textsanskrit{vihāracīvara}}, literally, “a dwelling robe”. Since “dwelling robe” is awkward in English, and because these robes did not belong to individual monastics, I prefer the given rendering. “A bedspread” renders \textit{\textsanskrit{uttarattharaṇa}}. Sp 1.517: \textit{\textsanskrit{Uttarattharaṇanti} \textsanskrit{mañcakassa} upari \textsanskrit{attharaṇakaṁ} vuccati}, “What is spread on top of a bed is called an \textit{\textsanskrit{uttarattharaṇa}}.” } If there’s none of these things, he should cover up with grass and leaves before going on. He should not go on while naked. If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. }

And\marginnote{2.17} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk asks an unrelated male or female householder for a robe, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. These are the appropriate occasions: his robes are stolen or his robes are lost.’” }

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, the monks from the group of six said to the monks whose robes had been stolen, “The Buddha has allowed a monk whose robes have been stolen or lost to ask an unrelated householder for a robe. You should ask for a robe.” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.6} not necessary. We’ve already gotten robes.” 

“We’ll\marginnote{1.7} ask for you.” 

“Do\marginnote{1.8} as you please.”\footnote{\textit{\textsanskrit{Viññāpetha} \textsanskrit{āvuso}}, literally, “Ask, friends.” } 

The\marginnote{1.9} monks from the group of six then went to householders and said, “Monks have arrived whose robes have been stolen. Please give them robes.” And they asked for many robes. 

Soon\marginnote{1.13} afterwards in the public meeting hall a certain man said to another, “Sir, monks have arrived whose robes have been stolen. I’ve given them robes.” 

The\marginnote{1.16} other replied, “So have I.” And another said the same. 

They\marginnote{1.18} complained and criticized those monks, “How can the Sakyan monastics ask for many robes without moderation? Are they going to trade in cloth or set up shop?” 

The\marginnote{1.21} monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How could the monks from the group of six ask for many robes without moderation?” 

After\marginnote{1.24} rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.26} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.27} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

“He’s\marginnote{1.1.9} my supporter.” 

Upananda\marginnote{1.1.10} then went to that man and said, “Is it true that you want to give me robe-cloth?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.1.12} that’s just what I was thinking.” 

“If\marginnote{1.1.14} that’s the case, give me such-and-such robe-cloth. For what’s the point of giving robe-cloth that I won’t use?”

The\marginnote{1.1.20} monks heard the complaints of that man, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How could Venerable Upananda go to a householder and say what kind of robe-cloth he wants without first being invited to do so?”

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time a certain government official was a supporter of Venerable Upananda the Sakyan. On one occasion that official sent a robe fund by messenger, saying, “Buy robe-cloth with this fund and give it to Venerable Upananda.” 

The\marginnote{1.1.4} messenger went to Upananda and said, “Venerable, I’ve brought a robe fund for you. Please receive it.” 

“We\marginnote{1.1.7} don’t receive robe funds, but we do receive allowable robe-cloth at the right time.” 

“Is\marginnote{1.1.9} there anyone who provides services for you?” 

Just\marginnote{1.1.11} then a lay follower had come to the monastery on some business. Upananda told the messenger, “This lay follower provides services for the monks.” 

The\marginnote{1.1.14} messenger instructed that lay follower and then returned to Upananda, saying, “I’ve instructed the lay follower you pointed out to me. Please go to them at the right time and they’ll give you robe-cloth.” 

Later\marginnote{1.1.17} on that government official sent a message to Upananda, saying, “Please use the robe-cloth. I would like you to use the robe-cloth.” When Upananda did not say anything to that lay follower, that government official sent him a second message saying the same thing. When Upananda still did not say anything to that lay follower, that government official sent him a third message. 

At\marginnote{1.2.1} that time the householder association had made an agreement that whoever came late to a meeting would be fined fifty coins. And now they were having a meeting. Just then Upananda went to that lay follower and said, “I need robe-cloth.” 

“Please\marginnote{1.2.5} wait one day, venerable, for today there’s a meeting of the householder association. They’ve made an agreement that whoever comes late gets fined fifty coins.” 

Saying,\marginnote{1.2.7} “Give me the robe-cloth today,” he grabbed him by the belt. 

Being\marginnote{1.2.8} pressured by Upananda, the lay follower bought him robe-cloth, and as a consequence he was late for the meeting. People asked him, “Sir, why are you late? You’ve just lost fifty coins.” 

When\marginnote{1.2.11} that lay follower told them what had happened, they complained and criticized Upananda, “These Sakyan monastics have great desires. They’re not content. It’s no easy matter to provide them with a service. How could Venerable Upananda not agree when asked by a lay follower to wait for a day?” 

The\marginnote{1.2.17} monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How could Venerable Upananda not agree when asked by a lay follower to wait for a day?” 

After\marginnote{1.2.21} rebuking him in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Upananda: “Is it true, Upananda, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.2.24} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.2.25} Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

Please receive it,” then that monk should reply, ‘We don’t receive robe funds, but we do receive allowable robe-cloth at the right time.’ If that messenger says, “Is there anyone who provides services for you?” the monk, if he needs robe-cloth, should point out a monastery worker or a lay follower and say, “They provide services for the monks.” If the messenger instructs that service provider and then returns to the monk and says, “Venerable, I have instructed the service provider you pointed out.

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Āḷavī} at the \textsanskrit{Aggāḷava} Shrine, the monks from the group of six went to silk-makers and said, “Please boil a heap of silkworms and give us silk. We want to make a blanket containing silk.” The silk-makers complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan monastics come and say such things to us? It’s our misfortune that we must kill many small creatures because of our livelihoods and because of our wives and children.”\footnote{“Children” renders \textit{putta/\textsanskrit{ā}}. In Pali the male gender takes precedent if a group contains people of both sexes. For instance, the plural \textit{\textsanskrit{puttā}}, “sons”, may mean “children” or “offsping”, depending on the context. In the same way, the plural \textit{\textsanskrit{bhātāro}}, “brothers”, can mean “siblings”. This way of understanding male-gender nouns is confirmed in the introduction to the Pali lexical work the \textsanskrit{Abhidhānappadīpikāṭīkā}: \textit{Ettha hi \textsanskrit{mātā} ca \textsanskrit{pitā} ca pitaro, putto ca \textsanskrit{dhītā} ca \textsanskrit{puttā}, sassu ca sasuro ca \textsanskrit{sasurā}, \textsanskrit{bhātā} ca \textsanskrit{bhaginī} ca \textsanskrit{bhātaroti} \textsanskrit{bhinnaliṅgānampi} ekaseso dassitoti}, “Mother and father are fathers; son and daughter are sons; mother-in-law and father-in-law are fathers-in-law; brother and sister are brothers;’ in this case the split gender is shown with only one gender remaining.” The \textsanskrit{Abhidhānappadīpikāṭīkā} is available online at tipitaka.org. } 

The\marginnote{1.9} monks heard the complaints of those silk-makers, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How could the monks from the group of six go to silk-makers and say such a thing?” 

After\marginnote{1.13} rebuking them in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.17} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.18} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time monks were having blankets made every year. They kept on begging and asking, “Please give wool! We need wool!” People complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan monastics have blankets made every year, begging and asking, ‘Please give wool! We need wool!’? We only make blankets for ourselves every five or six years, even though our children defecate and urinate on them and they are eaten by rats.” 

The\marginnote{1.12} monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How can those monks do this?” 

After\marginnote{1.16} rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that there are monks who do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.19} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.20} Buddha rebuked them, “How can those foolish men do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk has had a new blanket made, he should keep it for six years. Whether that blanket has been given away or not, if he has another new blanket made in less than six years, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.27} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

At\marginnote{2.1} one time a certain monk at \textsanskrit{Kosambī} was sick. His relatives sent him a message, saying, “Come, venerable, we’ll nurse you.” The monks urged him to go, but he said, “The Buddha has laid down a training rule that a monk who has had a new blanket made must keep it for six years. Now because I’m sick, I’m unable to travel with my blanket. And because I’m not comfortable without it, I can’t go.” 

They\marginnote{2.12} told the Buddha. 

Soon\marginnote{2.13} afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to give permission to a sick monk to make a blanket.\footnote{“Permission to make a blanket”, renders \textit{santhatasammuti}. The literal meaning, “blanket permission”, is ambiguous in English. } }

And\marginnote{2.15} it should be given like this. After approaching the Sangha, the sick monk should arrange his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, ‘Venerables, I’m sick. I’m unable to travel with my blanket. I ask the Sangha for permission to make a blanket.’ And he should ask a second and a third time. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: 

‘Please,\marginnote{2.23} venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The monk so-and-so is sick. He’s unable to travel with his blanket. He’s asking the Sangha for permission to make a blanket. If the Sangha is ready, it should give permission to monk so-and-so to make a blanket. This is the motion. 

Please,\marginnote{2.28} venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The monk so-and-so is sick. He’s unable to travel with his blanket. He’s asking the Sangha for permission to make a blanket. The Sangha gives permission to monk so-and-so to make a blanket. Any monk who approves of giving permission to monk so-and-so to make a blanket should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. 

The\marginnote{2.34} Sangha has given permission to monk so-and-so to make a blanket. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’ 

And\marginnote{2.37} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk has had a new blanket made, he should keep it for six years. Whether that blanket has been given away or not, if he has another new blanket made in less than six years, except if the monks have agreed, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’” }

There the Buddha addressed the monks: “Monks, I wish to do a solitary retreat for three months. No one should visit me except the one who brings me almsfood.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.1.4} sir,” they replied, and no one visited him except the one who brought him almsfood. 

Soon\marginnote{1.1.5} afterwards the Sangha at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} made the following agreement: “The Buddha wishes to be on solitary retreat for three months. No one should visit him except the one who brings him almsfood. Anyone who does must confess an offense entailing confession.” 

Just\marginnote{1.1.9} then Venerable Upasena of \textsanskrit{Vaṅganta} and his followers went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly-arrived monks, the Buddha said this to Upasena, “I hope you’re keeping well, Upasena, I hope you’re getting by? I hope you’re not tired from traveling?” 

“We’re\marginnote{1.1.13} keeping well, sir, we’re getting by. We’re not tired from traveling.” 

One\marginnote{1.1.15} of Upasena’s students was seated not far from the Buddha, and the Buddha said to him, “Do you like rag-robes, monk?” 

“I\marginnote{1.1.17} don’t like rag-robes, sir.” 

“Why\marginnote{1.1.18} then do you wear them?” 

“My\marginnote{1.1.19} preceptor wears them, and so I do it too.” 

And\marginnote{1.1.20} the Buddha said to Upasena, “Upasena, your followers are inspiring. How do you train them?” 

“When\marginnote{1.1.22} anyone asks me for the full ordination, I tell him this: ‘I stay in the wilderness, I eat only almsfood, and I wear rag-robes. If you do the same, I’ll give you the full ordination.’ If he agrees, I ordain him. Otherwise I don’t. And I do the same when anyone asks me for support.\footnote{“Support” renders \textit{nissaya}. See Appendix of Technical Terms for discussion. } It’s in this way that I train my followers.” 

“Good,\marginnote{1.2.1} Upasena, you train your followers well. But do you know the agreement made by the Sangha at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}?” 

“No.”\marginnote{1.2.3} 

“The\marginnote{1.2.4} Sangha at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} has made the following agreement: ‘The Buddha wishes to be on solitary retreat for three months. No one should visit him except the one who brings him almsfood. Anyone who does must confess an offense entailing confession.’” 

“Sir,\marginnote{1.2.8} let the Sangha at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} be known for this agreement. We, however, don’t lay down new rules, nor do we get rid of the existing ones. We practice and undertake the training rules as they are.” 

“Good,\marginnote{1.2.11} Upasena. One should not lay down new rules, nor should one get rid of the existing ones. One should practice and undertake the training rules as they are. 

\scrule{And, Upasena, I allow those monks who stay in the wilderness, who eat only almsfood, and who wear rag-robes to visit me whenever they please.” }

Upasena\marginnote{1.2.15} and his followers got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with their right sides toward him, and left. Just then a number of monks were standing outside the gateway, thinking, “We’ll make Venerable Upasena confess an offense entailing confession.”\footnote{“Outside the gateway” renders \textit{\textsanskrit{bahidvārakoṭṭhaka}} (in the previous sentence). See Appendix of Technical Terms for a discussion of the word \textit{\textsanskrit{koṭṭhaka}}. } And they said to Upasena, “Upasena, do you know the agreement of the Sangha at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}?” 

“The\marginnote{1.2.18} Buddha asked me the same question, and I replied that I didn’t. He then told me what it was, and I said, ‘Sir, let the Sangha at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} be known for this agreement. We, however, don’t lay down new rules, nor do we get rid of the existing ones. We practice and undertake the training rules as they are.’ Also, the Buddha has allowed those monks who stay in the wilderness, who eat only almsfood, and who wear rag-robes to visit him whenever they please.” 

Those\marginnote{1.2.27} monks thought, “It’s true what Venerable Upasena says.” 

The\marginnote{1.3.1} monks heard that the Buddha had allowed those monks who stay in the wilderness, who eat only almsfood, and who wear rag-robes to visit him whenever they please. Longing to see the Buddha, they discarded their blankets and undertook the practice of staying in the wilderness, of eating only almsfood, and of wearing rag-robes. 

Soon\marginnote{1.3.3} afterwards, when the Buddha and a number of monks were walking about the dwellings, he saw discarded blankets here and there. He asked the monks, “Who owns these discarded blankets?” 

The\marginnote{1.3.5} monks told him. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons: for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad people, for the ease of good monks, for the restraint of the corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of the corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training. And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, a certain monk was given wool as he was walking through the Kosalan country on his way to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. He bound it into a bundle with his upper robe and carried on. People who saw him teased him, “Venerable, how much did it cost you? How much will the profit be?” As a result he was humiliated. 

When\marginnote{1.8} he arrived at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}, he threw the wool to the ground. The monks asked him why. 

“People\marginnote{1.11} have been teasing me because of this wool.” 

“But\marginnote{1.12} how far have you carried it?” 

“Over\marginnote{1.13} 40 kilometers.” 

The\marginnote{1.14} monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How could a monk carry wool more than 40 kilometers?” 

After\marginnote{1.16} rebuking that monk in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monk, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.18} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.19} Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country in the Banyan Tree Monastery at Kapilavatthu. At that time the monks from the group of six had the nuns wash, dye, and comb wool. Because of this, the nuns neglected recitation, testing, the higher morality, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom.\footnote{“Testing” renders \textit{paripuccha}. The basic meaning of \textit{\textsanskrit{paripucchā}} is “to question” or “to ask”, as used for instance in \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc71/en/brahmali\#1.19.1}{Bu Pc 71}. Often, however, as in the present case, it refers to a teacher questioning his student, in the sense of finding out how much the student knows. In such cases I render the word as “testing”. } 

\textsanskrit{Mahāpajāpati}\marginnote{1.4} \textsanskrit{Gotamī} then went to the Buddha and bowed down to him. And the Buddha said to her, “\textsanskrit{Gotamī}, I hope the nuns are heedful, energetic, and diligent?” 

“How\marginnote{1.6} could the nuns be heedful, venerable sir?” And she told him what was happening. 

The\marginnote{1.9} Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching. She bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left. 

Soon\marginnote{1.11} afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks from the group of six: “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.13} true, sir.” 

“Are\marginnote{1.14} they your relatives?” 

“No.”\marginnote{1.15} 

“Foolish\marginnote{1.16} men, people who are unrelated don’t know what’s appropriate and inappropriate, what’s inspiring and uninspiring, in dealing with each other. And still you do this. This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. At that time Venerable Upananda was associating with a family from which he received a regular meal. Whenever that family obtained food, they put aside a portion for Upananda. And that’s what they did when one evening they obtained some meat. 

The\marginnote{1.6} following morning their son got up early and cried, “Give me meat!” The man said to his wife, “Give him the venerable’s portion. We’ll buy something else for the venerable.” 

On\marginnote{1.9} the same morning Upananda robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to that family where he sat down on the prepared seat. The man of the house approached Upananda, bowed, sat down, and said, “Yesterday evening, venerable, we obtained some meat, and we put aside a portion for you. But then in the morning our son got up early and cried, ‘Give me meat!’ and we gave him your portion. What can we get you for a \textit{\textsanskrit{kahāpaṇa}}?” 

“Are\marginnote{1.14} you giving up a \textit{\textsanskrit{kahāpaṇa}} coin for me?” 

“Yes.”\marginnote{1.15} 

“Then\marginnote{1.16} just give me that \textit{\textsanskrit{kahāpaṇa}}.” 

After\marginnote{1.17} giving a \textit{\textsanskrit{kahāpaṇa}} to Upananda, that man complained and criticized him, “The Sakyan monastics accept money just as we do.” 

The\marginnote{1.18} monks heard the complaints of that man, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How could Venerable Upananda receive money?” 

After\marginnote{1.21} rebuking him in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Upananda: “Is it true, Upananda, that you did this?”

It\marginnote{2.15} should be relinquished in the midst of the Sangha. “And, monks, it should be relinquished like this. After approaching the Sangha, that monk should arrange his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: 

‘Venerables,\marginnote{2.18} I have received money. It is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.’” 

After\marginnote{2.21} relinquishing it, he is to confess the offense. The confession should be received by a competent and capable monk. 

If\marginnote{2.23} a monastery worker or a lay follower is available, you should tell him, “Look into this.” If he says, “What can I get you with this?” one should not say, “Get this or that;” one should point out what is allowable: ghee, oil, honey, or syrup. If he makes a purchase and brings back what is allowable, everyone may enjoy it except the one who received the money. 

If\marginnote{2.32} this is what happens, all is well. If not, he should be told, “Discard it.” If he discards it, all is well. If he does not, a monk who has five qualities should be appointed as the money discarder: one who is not biased by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and who knows what has and has not been discarded. 

“And,\marginnote{2.38} monks, this is how he should be appointed. First the monk should be asked and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 

‘Please,\marginnote{2.41} venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. If the Sangha is ready, it should appoint monk so-and-so as the money discarder. This is the motion. 

Please,\marginnote{2.44} venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as the money discarder. Any monk who agrees to appointing monk so-and-so as the money discarder should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t agree should speak up. 

The\marginnote{2.48} Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as the money discarder. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’” 

The\marginnote{2.51} appointed monk should throw it away without taking note of where. If he takes note of where he throws it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

If\marginnote{2.53.1} it is money, and he perceives it as such, and he receives it, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time the monks from the group of six engaged in various kinds of trades involving money. People complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan monastics engage in trades that involve money? They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 

The\marginnote{1.5} monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How can the monks from the group of six do this?” 

After\marginnote{1.8} rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned those monks: “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.10} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.11} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\item[Various kinds: ] what is shaped, what is not shaped, and what is both shaped and not shaped. %
\item[What is shaped: ] what is meant for the head, what is meant for the neck, what is meant for the hands, what is meant for the feet, what is meant for the waist.\footnote{Sp 2.589: \textit{\textsanskrit{Sīsūpagantiādīsu} \textsanskrit{sīsaṁ} \textsanskrit{upagacchatīti} \textsanskrit{sīsūpagaṁ}, potthakesu pana “\textsanskrit{sīsūpaka}”nti \textsanskrit{likhitaṁ}, yassa kassaci \textsanskrit{sīsālaṅkārassetaṁ} \textsanskrit{adhivacanaṁ}. Esa nayo sabbattha}, “In regard to ʻWhat is meant for the head’, etc., ʻWhat is meant for the head’ means what goes to the head. In the books, however, it is written ʻ\textit{\textsanskrit{sīsūpaka}}’. This is a term for whatever is an ornament for the head. This is the method everywhere.” The basic meaning of the Pali word \textit{\textsanskrit{rūpiya}}, here rendered as “money”, is silver. We can infer from this that the ornaments mentioned in the commentary must be made of silver. The commentary suggests that gold is also included: Sp 1.587: \textit{\textsanskrit{Rūpiyasaṁvohāranti} \textsanskrit{jātarūparajataparivattanaṁ}}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Rūpiyasaṁvohāra}} means exchanging gold and silver.” } %

It\marginnote{2.25} should be relinquished in the midst of the Sangha. “And, monks, it should be relinquished like this. After approaching the Sangha, that monk should arrange his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, 

‘Venerables,\marginnote{2.28} I have engaged in various kinds of trades involving money. This is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.’” 

After\marginnote{2.31} relinquishing it, he is to confess the offense. The confession should be received by a competent and capable monk. 

If\marginnote{2.33} a monastery worker or a lay follower is available, you should tell him, “Look into this.” If he says, “What can I get you with this?” one should not say, “Get this or that;” one should point out what is allowable: ghee, oil, honey, or syrup. If he makes a purchase and brings back what is allowable, everyone may enjoy it except the one who did the exchange involving money. 

If\marginnote{2.42} this is what happens, all is well. If not, he should be told, “Discard this.” If he discards it, all is well. If he does not, a monk who has five qualities should be appointed as the money discarder: one who is not biased by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and who knows what has and has not been discarded. 

“And,\marginnote{2.48} monks, this is how he should be appointed. First the monk should be asked and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 

‘Please,\marginnote{2.51} venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. If the Sangha is ready, it should appoint monk so-and-so as the money discarder. This is the motion. 

Please,\marginnote{2.54} venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as the money discarder. Any monk who agrees to appointing monk so-and-so as the money discarder should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t agree should speak up. 

The\marginnote{2.58} Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as the money discarder. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’” 

The\marginnote{2.61} appointed monk should throw it away without taking note of where. If he takes note of where he throws it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had become skilled at making robes. He made an upper robe of old cloth, well-dyed and beautifully made, and he wore it.\footnote{For the rendering of \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghāṭi}} as “upper robe”, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } 

Just\marginnote{1.4} then a certain wanderer who was wearing an expensive robe went up to Upananda and said, “Your upper robe is beautiful. Please give it to me in exchange for my robe.” 

“Are\marginnote{1.7} you sure?” 

“I\marginnote{1.8} am.” 

Saying,\marginnote{1.9} “Alright, then,” he gave it. 

The\marginnote{1.10} wanderer put on the upper robe and went to the wanderers’ monastery. The wanderers said to him, “This upper robe of yours is beautiful. Where did you get it?” 

“I\marginnote{1.14} traded it for my robe.” 

“But\marginnote{1.15} how long will it last? Your other robe was better.” 

The\marginnote{1.17} wanderer realized they were right, and so he returned to Upananda and said, “Here’s your upper robe. Please give me back mine.” 

“But\marginnote{1.20} didn’t I ask you if you were sure? I won’t give it back.” 

Then\marginnote{1.22} that wanderer complained and criticized him, “Even householders give back to each other when they regret a trade. How, then, can a monastic not do the same?” 

The\marginnote{1.25} monks heard the complaints of that wanderer, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda, “How could Venerable Upananda barter with a wanderer?” 

After\marginnote{1.28} rebuking him in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Upananda: “Is it true, Upananda, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.30} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.31} Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, the monks from the group of six were storing up many almsbowls. When people walking about dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan monastics store up many bowls? Are they starting up as bowl merchants or setting up a bowl shop?” 

The\marginnote{1.6} monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How can the monks from the group of six keep extra bowls?” 

After\marginnote{1.9} rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.11} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.12} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk keeps an extra almsbowl, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.17} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards Venerable Ānanda was offered an extra bowl. He wanted to give it to Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, who was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāketa}. Knowing that the Buddha had laid down a rule against keeping an extra bowl, Venerable Ānanda thought, “What should I do now?” He told the Buddha, who said, “How long is it, Ānanda, before \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} returns?” 

“Nine\marginnote{2.13} or ten days, venerable sir.” 

Soon\marginnote{2.14} afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Monks, you should keep an extra almsbowl for ten days at the most. And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘A monk should keep an extra almsbowl for ten days at the most. If he keeps it longer than that, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’” }

\begin{description}%
\item[For ten days at the most: ] it should be kept ten days at a maximum. %
\item[An extra almsbowl: ] a bowl that is not determined, nor assigned to another.\footnote{For an explanation of the idea of \textit{\textsanskrit{vikappanā}}, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } %
\item[An almsbowl: ] there\marginnote{3.6} are two kinds of bowls: the iron bowl and the clay bowl. 

And\marginnote{3.7} there are three sizes of bowls: the large bowl, the medium bowl, and the small bowl.\footnote{Sp 1.602: \textit{Tayo pattassa \textsanskrit{vaṇṇāti} \textsanskrit{tīṇi} pattassa \textsanskrit{pamāṇāni}},  “\textit{Tayo pattassa \textsanskrit{vaṇṇā}}:  there are three measures of bowls.” } 

The\marginnote{3.8} large bowl: it takes half an \textit{\textsanskrit{āḷhaka}} measure of boiled rice, a fourth part of fresh food, and a suitable amount of curry.\footnote{Sp 1.602: \textit{\textsanskrit{Aḍḍhāḷhakodanaṁ} \textsanskrit{gaṇhātīti} \textsanskrit{magadhanāḷiyā} \textsanskrit{dvinnaṁ} \textsanskrit{taṇḍulanāḷīnaṁ} \textsanskrit{odanaṁ} \textsanskrit{gaṇhāti}}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Aḍḍhāḷhakodanaṁ} \textsanskrit{gaṇhāti}}: it takes rice to the quantity of two \textit{\textsanskrit{nāḷī}} measures of rice of the Magadha \textit{\textsanskrit{nāḷī}}.” } 

The\marginnote{3.9} medium bowl: it takes a \textit{\textsanskrit{nāḷika}} measure of boiled rice, a fourth part of fresh food, and a suitable amount of curry.\footnote{The medium size bowl is half the volume of the large bowl. Sp 1.602: \textit{\textsanskrit{Nāḷikodananti} \textsanskrit{magadhanāḷiyā} \textsanskrit{ekāya} \textsanskrit{taṇḍulanāḷiyā} \textsanskrit{odanaṁ}}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Nāḷikodananti}}: rice to the quantity of one \textit{\textsanskrit{nāḷī}} measure of rice of the Magadha \textit{\textsanskrit{nāḷī}}.” } 

The\marginnote{3.10} small bowl: it takes a \textit{pattha} measure of boiled rice, a fourth part of fresh food, and a suitable amount of curry.\footnote{The small bowl is half the volume of the medium size bowl. Sp 1.602: \textit{Patthodananti \textsanskrit{magadhanāḷiyā} \textsanskrit{upaḍḍhanāḷikodanaṁ}}, “\textit{Patthodananti}: rice to the quantity of half a \textit{\textsanskrit{nāḷī}} of the Magadha \textit{\textsanskrit{nāḷī}} .” } Anything larger than this is not a bowl, nor anything smaller. 

%
\item[If he keeps it longer than that, it becomes subject to relinquishment: ] it becomes subject to relinquishment at dawn on the eleventh day.\footnote{According to the commentary this means the tenth dawn after one received the bowl. Sp 1.463: \textit{\textsanskrit{Cīvaruppādadivasaena} \textsanskrit{saddhiṁ} \textsanskrit{ekādase} \textsanskrit{aruṇuggamane} \textsanskrit{nissaggiyaṁ} \textsanskrit{hotīti} \textsanskrit{veditabbaṁ}}, “It is to be understood in this way: it is to be relinquished on the eleventh dawn including the day when the robe (or bowl) was given.” } %

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1.1} one time the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country in the Banyan Tree Monastery at Kapilavatthu. At that time a potter had invited the monks, saying, “If any of you needs an almsbowl, I’ll provide it.” But the monks had no sense of moderation, and they asked for many bowls. Those who had small bowls asked for large ones, and those who had large bowls asked for small ones. The potter was so busy making bowls for the monks that he was unable to make goods for sale. He could not make a living for himself, and his wives and children suffered. People complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan monastics have no sense of moderation and ask for many bowls? This potter is so busy making bowls for them that he is unable to make goods for sale. He is unable to make a living for himself, and his wives and children are suffering.” 

The\marginnote{1.1.13} monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How can those monks have no sense of moderation and ask for many bowls?” 

After\marginnote{1.1.16} rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that there are monks who do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.1.18} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.1.19} Buddha rebuked them … “How can those foolish men do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … After rebuking them, he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

“Monks,\marginnote{1.1.23} a monk should not ask for an almsbowl. If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.” 

Soon\marginnote{1.2.1} afterwards the bowl of a certain monk broke. Knowing that the Buddha had prohibited asking for a bowl and being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not ask for a new one. As a consequence, he collected almsfood with his hands. People complained and criticized him, “How can the Sakyan monastics collect almsfood with their hands, just like the monastics of other religions?” 

The\marginnote{1.2.6} monks heard the complaints of those people and they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

“Monks,\marginnote{1.2.9} I allow you to ask for a new almsbowl if your bowl has been lost or is broken.” 

When\marginnote{1.3.1} they heard about the Buddha’s allowance, the monks from the group of six asked for many bowls even when their existing bowls only had a minor chip or scratch. Once again that potter was so busy making bowls for the monks that he was unable to make goods for sale. He could not make a living for himself, and his wives and children suffered.\footnote{“Children” renders \textit{putta/\textsanskrit{ā}}. In Pali the male gender takes precedent if a group contains people of both sexes. For instance, the plural \textit{\textsanskrit{puttā}}, “sons”, may mean “children” or “offsping”, depending on the context. In the same way, the plural \textit{\textsanskrit{bhātāro}}, “brothers”, can mean “siblings”. This way of understanding male-gender nouns is confirmed in the introduction to the Pali lexical work the \textsanskrit{Abhidhānappadīpikāṭīkā}: \textit{Ettha hi \textsanskrit{mātā} ca \textsanskrit{pitā} ca pitaro, putto ca \textsanskrit{dhītā} ca \textsanskrit{puttā}, sassu ca sasuro ca \textsanskrit{sasurā}, \textsanskrit{bhātā} ca \textsanskrit{bhaginī} ca \textsanskrit{bhātaroti} \textsanskrit{bhinnaliṅgānampi} ekaseso dassitoti}, “Mother and father are fathers; son and daughter are sons; mother-in-law and father-in-law are fathers-in-law; brother and sister are brothers;’ in this case the split gender is shown with only one gender remaining.” The \textsanskrit{Abhidhānappadīpikāṭīkā} is available online at tipitaka.org. } And people complained and criticized them as before. 

The\marginnote{1.3.7} monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How can the monks from the group of six ask for many bowls even when their existing bowls only has a minor chip or scratch?” 

After\marginnote{1.3.10} rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.3.12} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.3.13} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk exchanges an almsbowl with fewer than five mends for a new almsbowl, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. That monk should relinquish that almsbowl to a gathering of monks. He should then be given the last almsbowl belonging to that gathering: “Monk, this bowl is yours. Keep it until it breaks.” This is the proper procedure.’” }

\end{description}

It\marginnote{2.1.16} should be relinquished in the midst of the Sangha. All determined bowls should be brought together. One should not determine an inferior bowl, thinking, “I’ll get a valuable one.” 

If\marginnote{2.1.20} one determines an inferior bowl, thinking, “I’ll get a valuable one,” one commits an offense of wrong conduct. 

“And,\marginnote{2.1.21} monks, it should be relinquished like this. After approaching the Sangha, that monk should arrange his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: 

‘Venerables,\marginnote{2.1.23} this almsbowl, which I got in exchange for a bowl that had fewer than five mends, is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.’” 

After\marginnote{2.1.25} relinquishing it, he should confess the offense. The confession should be received by a competent and capable monk. 

A\marginnote{2.1.27} monk who has five qualities should be appointed as the distributor of almsbowls: one who is not biased by favoritism, ill will, confusion, or fear, and who knows what has and has not been distributed. “And, monks, this is how he should be appointed. First the monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 

‘Please,\marginnote{2.1.32} venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. If the Sangha is ready, it should appoint monk so-and-so as the distributor of almsbowls. This is the motion. 

Please,\marginnote{2.1.35} venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as the distributor of almsbowls. Any monk who agrees to appointing monk so-and-so as the distributor of almsbowls should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t agree should speak up. 

The\marginnote{2.1.39} Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as the distributor of almsbowls. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’” 

The\marginnote{2.1.42} appointed monk should give away that relinquished bowl. He should tell the most senior monk, “Sir, would you like this bowl?” If the most senior monk takes it, his old bowl should be offered to the next monk. 

He\marginnote{2.1.46} should not not take that bowl out of sympathy. If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 

It\marginnote{2.1.47} is not to be offered to anyone who does not have bowl. In this manner it should be offered all the way to the most junior monk in the Sangha. 

\begin{description}%
\item[He should then be given the last almsbowl belonging to that gathering: “Monk, this bowl is yours.

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, Venerable Pilindavaccha was clearing a slope near \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, intending to build a shelter. Just then King Seniya \textsanskrit{Bimbisāra} of Magadha went to Pilindavaccha, bowed, sat down, and said, “Venerable, what are you having made?” 

“I’m\marginnote{1.1.4} clearing a slope, great king. I want to build a shelter.” 

“Do\marginnote{1.1.5} you need a monastery worker?” 

“The\marginnote{1.1.6} Buddha hasn’t allowed monastery workers.” 

“Well\marginnote{1.1.7} then, sir, please ask the Buddha and tell me the outcome.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.1.8} great king.” 

Pilindavaccha\marginnote{1.1.9} then instructed, inspired, and gladdened King \textsanskrit{Bimbisāra} with a teaching, after which the king got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated Pilindavaccha with his right side toward him, and left. 

Soon\marginnote{1.1.11} afterwards Pilindavaccha sent a message to the Buddha: “Sir, King Seniya \textsanskrit{Bimbisāra} of Magadha wishes to provide a monastery worker. What should I tell him?” The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow monastery workers.” }

Once\marginnote{1.1.16} again King \textsanskrit{Bimbisāra} went to Pilindavaccha, bowed, sat down, and said, “Sir, has the Buddha allowed monastery workers?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.1.18} great king.” 

“Well\marginnote{1.1.19} then, I’ll provide you with a monastery worker.” 

But\marginnote{1.1.20} after making this promise, he forgot, and only remembered after a long time. He then addressed the official in charge of all practical affairs: “Listen, has the monastery worker I promised been provided?” 

“No,\marginnote{1.1.21} sir, he hasn’t.” 

“How\marginnote{1.1.22} long has it been since we made that promise?” 

The\marginnote{1.1.23} official counted the days and said, “It’s been five hundred days.” 

“Well\marginnote{1.1.24} then, provide him with five hundred monastery workers.” 

“Yes.”\marginnote{1.1.25} 

The\marginnote{1.1.26} official provided Pilindavaccha with those monastery workers and a separate village was established. They called it “The Monastery Workers’ Village” and “Pilinda Village”. 

And\marginnote{1.2.1} Pilindavaccha began associating with the families in that village. 

After\marginnote{1.2.2} robing up one morning, he took his bowl and robe and went to Pilinda Village for alms. At that time they were holding a celebration in that village and the children were dressed up with ornaments and garlands. As Pilindavaccha was walking on continuous almsround, he came to the house of a certain monastery worker where he sat down on the prepared seat. Just then the daughter of that house had seen the other children dressed up in ornaments and garlands. She cried, saying, “Give me a garland! Give me ornaments!” Pilindavaccha asked her mother why the girl was crying. She told him, adding, “Poor people like us can’t afford garlands and ornaments.” Pilindavaccha took a pad of grass and said to the mother, “Here, place this on the girl’s head.” She did, and it turned into a beautiful golden garland. Even the royal compound had nothing like it. 

People\marginnote{1.2.11} told King \textsanskrit{Bimbisāra}, “In the house of such-and-such a monastery worker there’s a beautiful golden garland. Even in your court, sir, there’s nothing like it. So how did those poor people get it? They must have stolen it.” King \textsanskrit{Bimbisāra} had that family imprisoned. 

Once\marginnote{1.2.16} again Pilindavaccha robed up in the morning, took his bowl and robe, and went to Pilinda Village for alms. As he was walking on continuous almsround, he came to the house of that monastery worker. He then asked the neighbors what had happened to that family. 

“The\marginnote{1.2.18} king has jailed them, venerable, because of that golden garland.” 

Pilindavaccha\marginnote{1.3.1} then went to King \textsanskrit{Bimbisāra}’s house and sat down on the prepared seat. King \textsanskrit{Bimbisāra} approached Pilindavaccha, bowed, and sat down. Pilindavaccha said, “Great king, why have you jailed the family of that monastery worker?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{1.3.4} in the house of that monastery worker there was a beautiful golden garland. Even the royal compound has nothing like it. So how did those poor people get it? They must have stolen it.” 

Pilindavaccha\marginnote{1.3.8} then focused his mind on turning King \textsanskrit{Bimbisāra}’s stilt house into gold. As a result, the whole house became gold. He said, “Great king, how did you get so much gold?” 

“Understood,\marginnote{1.3.11} sir! It’s your supernormal power.” He then released that family. 

People\marginnote{1.3.13} said, “They say Venerable Pilindavaccha has performed a superhuman feat, a wonder of supernormal power, for the king and his court!” Being delighted and gaining confidence in Pilindavaccha, they brought him the five tonics: ghee, butter, oil, honey, and syrup. Ordinarily, too, Pilindavaccha was getting the five tonics. Since he was getting so much, he gave it away to his followers, who ended up with an abundance of tonics. After filling up basins and waterpots and setting these aside, they filled their water filters and bags and hung these in the windows. But the tonics were dripping, and the dwellings became infested with rats.\footnote{Sp 1.621: \textit{\textsanskrit{Olīnavilīnānīti} \textsanskrit{heṭṭhā} ca ubhatopassesu ca \textsanskrit{gaḷitāni}}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Olīnavilīnāni}}: dripping from below and from both sides.” } When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them, “These Sakyan monastics are hoarding things indoors, just like King Seniya \textsanskrit{Bimbisāra} of Magadha.” 

The\marginnote{1.3.22} monks heard the complaints of those people and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How can these monks choose to live with such abundance?” 

After\marginnote{1.3.25} rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that there are monks who live like this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.3.27} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.3.28} Buddha rebuked them … “How can those foolish men live like this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘After being received, the tonics allowable for sick monks—that is, ghee, butter, oil, honey, and syrup—should be used from storage for at most seven days.\footnote{For the rendering of \textit{bhesajja} as “tonic”, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } If one uses them longer than that, one commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.’” }

SED defines \textit{\textsanskrit{phāṇita}} as “the inspissated juice of the sugar cane or other plants”, in other words, “cane syrup”. According to the commentary at Sp 1.623 it can be either cooked or uncooked, the difference presumably whether it is raw or concentrated. “Syrup” seems closer to the mark than “molasses”. } %
\item[After being received, they should be used from storage for at most seven days: ] they are to be used for seven days at a maximum. %

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, Venerable Upananda the Sakyan said to his brother’s student, “Come, let’s go wandering the country.” 

“I\marginnote{1.4} can’t, venerable, my robes are worn out.” 

“I’ll\marginnote{1.6} give you a robe.” And he gave him a robe. 

Soon\marginnote{1.8} afterwards that monk heard that the Buddha was about to go wandering the country. He thought, “Now I’ll go wandering with the Buddha instead.” Then, when Upananda said, “Let’s go,” he replied, “I’m not going with you, but with the Buddha.” 

“Well,\marginnote{1.15} that robe I gave you is going with me,” and he just took it back in anger. 

That\marginnote{1.17} monk told other monks what had happened. And the monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda, “How could Venerable Upananda give away a robe and then take it back in anger?” 

After\marginnote{1.20} rebuking him in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, Upananda, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.22} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.23} Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} in the Bamboo Grove, the monks from the group of six were making robes and they asked for a large amount of thread.\footnote{From the origin story to Bu Pc 32 it seems \textit{\textsanskrit{cīvarakārasamaya}} refers to any time one is making a robe, see \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32/en/brahmali\#9.1.10}{Bu Pc 32:9.1.10}. } But when their robes were finished, there was much thread left over. They said, “Well, let’s ask for even more thread and get weavers to weave us robe-cloth.” Yet even when that robe-cloth had been woven, there was much thread left over. A second time they asked for more thread and had weavers weave them robe-cloth. Once again there was much thread left over. A third time they asked for more thread and had weavers weave them robe-cloth. People complained and criticized them, “How could the Sakyan monastics ask for thread and then get weavers to weave them robe-cloth?” 

The\marginnote{1.13} monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How could the monks from the group of six ask for thread and then get weavers to weave them robe-cloth?” 

After\marginnote{1.16} rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned those monks: “Is it true, monks, that you did this?”

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, a man who was going away said to his wife, “Please weigh some thread, take it to the weavers, get them to weave robe-cloth, and put the robe-cloth aside. When I return, I’ll give it to Venerable Upananda.” 

An\marginnote{1.4} alms-collecting monk heard that man speaking those words. He then went to Upananda the Sakyan and said, “Upananda, you have much merit. In such-and-such a place I heard a man, as he was going away, tell his wife to get robe-cloth woven so that he could give it to you when he returned.” 

“He’s\marginnote{1.7} my supporter.” And the weaver was Upananda’s supporter too. 

Upananda\marginnote{1.9} then went to that weaver and said, “This robe-cloth that you’re weaving for me, make it long and wide. And make it closely woven, well-woven, well-stretched, well-scraped, and well-combed.” 

“Venerable,\marginnote{1.11} they’ve already weighed the thread and given it to me, telling me to weave the robe-cloth with that. I won’t be able to make it long, wide, or closely woven. But I’m able to make it well-woven, well-stretched, well-scraped, and well-combed.” 

“Just\marginnote{1.15} make it long, wide, and closely woven. There’ll be enough thread.” 

Then,\marginnote{1.17} when all the thread had been used up, that weaver went to that woman and said, “Ma’am, I need more thread.” 

“But\marginnote{1.18} didn’t I tell you to weave the robe-cloth with that thread?” 

“You\marginnote{1.19} did. But Venerable Upananda told me to make it long, wide, and closely woven. And he said there would be enough thread.” That woman then gave him as much thread again as she had done the first time. 

When\marginnote{1.23} Upananda heard that the husband had returned from his travels, he went to his house and sat down on the prepared seat. That man approached him, bowed, and sat down. He then said to his wife, “Has the robe-cloth been woven?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.26} it has.” 

“Please\marginnote{1.27} bring it. I’ll give it to Venerable Upananda.” 

She\marginnote{1.28} then got the robe-cloth, gave it to her husband, and told him what had happened. After giving the robe-cloth to Upananda, he complained and criticized him, “These Sakyan monastics have great desires; they’re not content. It’s no easy matter to give them robe-cloth. How could Venerable Upananda go to the weavers and say what kind of robe-cloth he wanted without first being invited by me?” 

The\marginnote{1.33} monks heard the complaints of that man, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda, “How could Venerable Upananda go to a householder’s weavers and say what kind of robe-cloth he wants without first being invited?” 

After\marginnote{1.36} rebuking him in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Upananda: “Is it true, Upananda, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.38} true, sir.” 

“Is\marginnote{1.39} he a relative of yours?” 

“No,\marginnote{1.40} sir.” 

“Foolish\marginnote{1.41} man, people who are unrelated don’t know what’s appropriate and inappropriate, what’s good and bad, in dealing with each other. And still you did this. This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, a government official who was about to set out on a journey sent a message to the monks, saying, “Come, venerables, I wish to give robe-cloth to those who have completed the rainy-season residence.” 

The\marginnote{1.1.4} monks thought, “The Buddha has allowed such robes only for those who have completed the rains residence,” and being afraid of wrongdoing they did not go. That government official complained and criticized them, “How could they not come when I send a message? I’m about to set out with the army. It’s hard to know whether I’ll live or die.” 

The\marginnote{1.1.11} monks heard the complaints of that government official, and they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to receive a haste-cloth, and then store it.” }

When\marginnote{1.2.1} they heard about this, monks received haste-cloths and stored them beyond the robe season, keeping them in bundles on a bamboo robe rack. 

While\marginnote{1.2.5} walking about the dwellings, Venerable Ānanda saw that cloth, and he asked the monks, “Whose cloth is this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.2.7} our haste-cloth.” 

“But\marginnote{1.2.8} how long have you stored it?” 

They\marginnote{1.2.9} told him. Ānanda then complained and criticized them, “How could these monks receive haste-cloth and then store it beyond the robe season?” 

After\marginnote{1.2.12} rebuking those monks in many ways, Ānanda told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that there are monks who do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.2.14} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.2.15} Buddha rebuked them … “Monks, how could those foolish men do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘When there are ten days left to the Kattika full moon that ends the first rainy-season residence and haste-cloth is given to a monk, he may receive it if he regards it as urgent.

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time monks who had completed the rainy-season residence were staying in wilderness dwellings. Thieves who were active during the month of Kattika attacked those monks, thinking, “They have been given things.” 

The\marginnote{1.1.5} monks told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow monks who are staying in wilderness dwellings to store one of their three robes in an inhabited area.” }

When\marginnote{1.2.1} they heard about this, monks stored one of their three robes in inhabited areas, staying apart from them for more than six days. The robes were lost, destroyed, burned, and eaten by rats. As a consequence, those monks became poorly dressed. Other monks asked them why, and they told them what had happened. The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How could those monks store one of their three robes in an inhabited area and then stay apart from it for more than six days?” 

After\marginnote{1.2.9} rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that there are monks who do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.2.11} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.2.12} Buddha rebuked them … “Monks, how could those foolish men do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘There are wilderness dwellings that are considered risky and dangerous. After observing the Kattika full moon that ends the rainy season, a monk who is staying in such a dwelling may, if he so desires, store one of his three robes in an inhabited area so long as he has a reason for staying apart from that robe. He should stay apart from that robe for six days at the most.

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, an association had prepared a meal together with robe-cloth for the Sangha, intending to offer the robe-cloth after giving the meal. 

But\marginnote{1.4} the monks from the group of six went to that association and said, “Please give this robe-cloth to us.” 

“Venerables,\marginnote{1.7} we can’t do that. We’ve prepared our annual alms-offering together with robe-cloth for the Sangha.” 

“The\marginnote{1.9} Sangha has many donors and supporters. But since we’re staying here, we look to you for support. If you don’t give to us, who will? So give us the robe-cloth.” Being pressured by the monks from the group of six, that association gave the prepared robe-cloth to them and served the food to the Sangha. 

The\marginnote{1.14} monks who knew that a meal together with robe-cloth had been prepared for the Sangha, but who did not know that the robe-cloth had been given to the monks from the group of six, said, “Please offer the robe-cloth.” 

“There\marginnote{1.16} isn’t any. The monks from the group of six have diverted to themselves the robe-cloth we had prepared.” 

The\marginnote{1.18} monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How could the monks from the group of six divert to themselves things they knew were intended for the Sangha?” 

After\marginnote{1.20} rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.22} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.23} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\item[Monk: ] … The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case. %
\item[He knows: ] he knows by himself or others have told him or the donor has told him.\footnote{The meaning of the last of these three ways of knowing, \textit{so \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{āroceti}}, is not clear. CPD suggests: “\textit{sa (\textsanskrit{sā}) \textsanskrit{āroceti}} (?). Perhaps this last form is conformable to sa. \textit{\textsanskrit{ārocayate}} med. caus. in the meaning: he or she makes inquiries (of others).” However, this does not fit with the parallel usage at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29/en/brahmali\#3.1.6}{Bu Pc 29:3.1.6} where the text says that she tells (\textit{\textsanskrit{sā} \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{āroceti}}) him, presumably referring to the nun telling the monk. In this case \textit{\textsanskrit{āroceti}} cannot refer to the monk making inquiries. The commentaries are silent, and I therefore assume that a straightforward meaning is the most likely one. I would suggest, then, that it simply refers to the donor telling the monk directly. } %
\item[For the Sangha: ] given to the Sangha, given up to the Sangha. %
\item[Material support: ] robe-cloth, almsfood, a dwelling, and medicinal supplies; even a bit of bath powder, a tooth cleaner, or a piece of string. %

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, the monks from the group of six were arguing with and speaking abusively to the good monks. They reviled and insulted them about their caste, name, family, occupation, profession, illnesses, physical traits, defilements, and offenses, and by calling them names. The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can the monks from the group of six argue with and abuse good monks? How can they revile and insult them about these things?” 

After\marginnote{1.1.7} rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that you’re doing this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.1.9} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.1.10} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\subparagraph*{Jataka }

“Once\marginnote{1.2.1} upon a time, monks, there was a brahmin in \textsanskrit{Takkasilā} who had an ox called \textsanskrit{Nandivisāla}. On one occasion the ox said to that brahmin, ‘Go, brahmin, and bet a thousand coins with the wealthy merchant that your ox will pull one hundred carts tied together.’ And that brahmin did just that. Then, after tying one hundred carts together and yoking \textsanskrit{Nandivisāla} to them, he said, ‘Go, you fraud! Pull, you liar!’ But \textsanskrit{Nandivisāla} didn’t budge. 

Then\marginnote{1.2.10} that brahmin became depressed because he had lost a thousand coins. \textsanskrit{Nandivisāla} said to him, ‘Why are you depressed?’ 

‘Because\marginnote{1.2.13} I lost one thousand coins because of you.’ 

‘But\marginnote{1.2.14} why did you disgrace me by calling me a fraud when I’m not? Now go, brahmin, and make the same bet with that merchant, but increase the stakes to two thousand coins. Just don’t disgrace me by calling me a fraud.’ Once again that brahmin did just that. Then, after tying one hundred carts together and yoking \textsanskrit{Nandivisāla} to them, he said, ‘Go, good ox! Pull, good ox!’ And \textsanskrit{Nandivisāla} pulled those one hundred carts. 

\begin{verse}%
‘One\marginnote{1.2.23} should say what’s pleasant, \\
Never what’s unpleasant. \\
Because of his pleasant speech, \\
Heavy loads were pulled, \\
And he obtained wealth; \\
And he was delighted with that.’ 

%
\end{verse}

Even\marginnote{1.2.29} at that time, monks, reviling and insulting was unpleasant to me. How then could reviling and insulting be pleasant now? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, the monks from the group of six were engaged in malicious talebearing between monks who were arguing. After hearing something on one side they reported it to the other side, and vice versa, in order to create division between them. In this way they started new quarrels and made existing quarrels worse. 

The\marginnote{1.5} monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can the monks from the group of six engage in malicious talebearing between monks who are arguing? How can they report to one side what they have heard on the other side, and vice versa, in order to create division, and in this way start new quarrels and make existing quarrels worse?” 

After\marginnote{1.9} rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned those monks: “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.12} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.13} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk engages in malicious talebearing between monks, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”\footnote{This is translated somewhat freely in accordance with the explanation below and in the commentary. According to \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc3/en/brahmali\#2.3.1}{Bu Pc 3:2.3.1} the offense is only incurred when a monk brings the words of another monk to the attention of yet another monk, and thus the translation “between monks”. Sp 2.37 supports the plural rendering “monks”: \textit{\textsanskrit{Bhikkhūnaṁ} \textsanskrit{pesuññe}}, “Malicious talebearing of monks”. } }

\subsection*{Definitions }

\begin{description}%
\item[Malicious talebearing: ] there is malicious talebearing in two ways: for one wanting to endear himself and for one aiming at division. One engages in malicious talebearing in ten ways: about caste, about name, about family, about occupation, about profession, about illnesses, about physical traits, about defilements, about offenses, and by name-calling. %

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, the monks from the group of six were instructing lay followers to memorize the Teaching. Those lay followers became disrespectful, undeferential, and rude toward the monks. 

The\marginnote{1.4} monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can the monks from the group of six instruct lay followers to memorize the Teaching?” 

After\marginnote{1.7} rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.10} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.11} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this?” This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Āḷavī} at the \textsanskrit{Aggāḷava} Shrine. At that time the lay followers were coming to the monastery to listen to the Teaching. When the instruction was over, the senior monks went to their own dwellings, but the newly ordained monks lay down right there in the assembly hall together with the lay followers—absentminded, heedless, naked, muttering, and snoring. The lay followers complained and criticized them, “How can the venerables lie down absentminded, heedless, naked, muttering, and snoring?” 

The\marginnote{1.7} monks heard the complaints of those lay followers, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How can monks lie down in the same sleeping place as people who are not fully ordained?” 

After\marginnote{1.10} rebuking those newly ordained monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that monks did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.12} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.13} Buddha rebuked them … “How could those foolish men do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk lies down in the same sleeping place as a person who is not fully ordained, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.18} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

After\marginnote{2.1} staying at \textsanskrit{Āḷavī} for as long as he wanted, the Buddha set out wandering toward \textsanskrit{Kosambī}. When he eventually arrived, he stayed at the \textsanskrit{Badarikā} Monastery. 

Just\marginnote{2.3} then the monks there said to Venerable \textsanskrit{Rāhula}, “\textsanskrit{Rāhula}, the Buddha has laid down a training rule that we can’t lie down in the same sleeping place as a person who’s not fully ordained. Please find another sleeping place.” Since \textsanskrit{Rāhula} was not able to find a sleeping place, he lay down in the restroom. 

Then,\marginnote{2.7} after rising early in the morning, the Buddha went to the restroom where he cleared his throat. \textsanskrit{Rāhula}, too, cleared his throat. 

“Who’s\marginnote{2.9} there?” 

“It’s\marginnote{2.10} me, sir, \textsanskrit{Rāhula}.” 

“Why\marginnote{2.11} are you sitting here, \textsanskrit{Rāhula}?” 

\textsanskrit{Rāhula}\marginnote{2.12} told the Buddha what had happened. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to lie down in the same sleeping place as a person who isn’t fully ordained for two or three nights. }

And\marginnote{2.15} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk lies down more than two or three nights in the same sleeping place as a person who is not fully ordained, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, Venerable Anuruddha was walking through the Kosalan country on his way to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}, when one evening he arrived at a certain village. Just then a woman in that village had prepared her guesthouse.\footnote{Sp 2.55: \textit{\textsanskrit{Āvasathāgāranti} \textsanskrit{āgantukānaṁ} \textsanskrit{vasanāgāraṁ}}, “A house for visitors to stay.” } Anuruddha went to that woman and said, “If it’s not inconvenient for you, I’d like to stay in your guesthouse for one night.” 

“Please\marginnote{1.5} stay, venerable.” 

Other\marginnote{1.6} travelers also went to that woman and said, “Ma’am, if it’s not troublesome for you, we’d like to stay in your guesthouse for one night.” 

“Sirs,\marginnote{1.7} a monastic is already staying there. If he agrees, you may stay.” 

Those\marginnote{1.8} travelers then approached Anuruddha and said, “If you don’t mind, venerable, we’d like to stay one night in the guesthouse.” 

“No\marginnote{1.9} problem.” 

Now\marginnote{1.10} as soon as that woman had seen Anuruddha, she had fallen in love with him. She now went to him and said, “Sir, you won’t be comfortable surrounded by these people. Why don’t I prepare a bed for you in the main house?” Anuruddha consented by remaining silent. 

After\marginnote{1.14} preparing a bed in the main house, she put on jewelery and perfume, and she went to Anuruddha and said, “You’re attractive, sir, and so am I. Why don’t you take me as your wife?” But Anuruddha remained silent. She said the same thing a second time, but again got no response. And a third time she said, “You’re attractive, sir, and so am I. Why don’t you take me and all this property?” Once again Anuruddha remained silent. She then threw off her wrap, and she walked back and forth, stood, sat down, and lay down in front of him. But Anuruddha controlled his senses and neither looked at nor spoke to her. Then that woman said, “It’s astonishing and amazing. Many people pay a hundred or a thousand coins to be with me. But this monastic doesn’t want me and all this property, even when I beg him!” After dressing, she bowed down with her head at Anuruddha’s feet and said, “Sir, I’ve made a mistake. I’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful. Please forgive me so that I may restrain myself in the future.” 

“You\marginnote{1.31} have certainly made a mistake. You’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful. But since you acknowledge your mistake and make proper amends, I forgive you. For this is called growth in the training of the noble ones: acknowledging a mistake, making proper amends, and undertaking restraint for the future.”\footnote{“Training” renders \textit{vinaya}.  See Appendix of Technical Terms for a discussion. } 

The\marginnote{1.34} following morning that woman personally served and satisfied Anuruddha with various kinds of fine foods. When he had finished his meal, she bowed and sat down to one side. And Anuruddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching. She then said to him, “Wonderful, sir, wonderful! Just as one might set upright what’s overturned, or reveal what’s hidden, or show the way to one who’s lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see what is there—just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha of monks. Please accept me as a lay follower who’s gone for refuge for life.” 

Soon\marginnote{1.42} afterwards, after arriving at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}, Anuruddha told the monks what had happened. The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How can Venerable Anuruddha lie down in the same sleeping place as a woman?” 

After\marginnote{1.45} rebuking him in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Anuruddha: “Is it true, Anuruddha, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.47} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.48} Buddha rebuked him … “Anuruddha, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

At that time Venerable \textsanskrit{Udāyī} was associating with and visiting a number of families in \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. After robing up one morning, he took his bowl and robe and went to a certain family. Just then the housewife was sitting at the door to the house, while the daughter-in-law at the door to guesthouse. \textsanskrit{Udāyī} went up to the housewife and gave her a teaching, whispering in her ear.

After\marginnote{1.8} teaching the housewife in this way, \textsanskrit{Udāyī} went up to the daughter-in-law and gave her a teaching in the same way. Then the housewife thought, “Is this monastic my daughter-in-law’s lover, or is he speaking indecently?” 

When\marginnote{1.11} \textsanskrit{Udāyī} had left, the housewife said to her daughter-in-law, “Hey, what did that monastic say to you?” 

“He\marginnote{1.14} gave me a teaching, ma’am. But what did he say to you?” 

“He\marginnote{1.16} gave me a teaching, too.” 

And\marginnote{1.17} they complained and criticized him, “How can Venerable \textsanskrit{Udāyī} give teachings by whispering in the ear? Should not teachings be given audibly and openly?”

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards some female lay followers saw some monks and said to them, “Venerables, please give a teaching.” 

“It’s\marginnote{2.3} not allowable for us to teach women.” 

“Just\marginnote{2.4} teach five or six sentences. That might be enough for us to understand.” 

“It’s\marginnote{2.5} not allowable for us to teach women.” And being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not teach them. 

Those\marginnote{2.7} female lay followers complained and criticized them, “How can they not teach us when asked?” 

The\marginnote{2.9} monks heard the complaints of those female lay followers, and they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to teach five or six sentences to a woman. }

And\marginnote{2.13} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Second preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk gives a teaching of more than five or six sentences to a woman, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{2.15} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Third sub-story }

When\marginnote{3.1} the monks from the group of six heard that the Buddha had made this allowance, they taught women more than five or six sentences with a man who did not understand sitting nearby. The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can the monks from the group of six teach women more than five or six sentences with a man who doesn’t understand sitting nearby?” 

After\marginnote{3.4} rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{3.6} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{3.7} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\scrule{‘If a monk gives a teaching of more than five or six sentences to a woman, except in the presence of a man who understands, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood near \textsanskrit{Vesālī}, a number of monks who were friends had entered the rainy-season residence on the banks of the river \textsanskrit{Vaggumudā}. At that time \textsanskrit{Vajjī} was short of food and afflicted with hunger, with crops affected by whiteheads and turned to straw. It was not easy to get by on almsfood.\footnote{“Whiteheads” renders \textit{\textsanskrit{setaṭṭ}(h)\textsanskrit{ikā}}, literally, “white bones”. Sp 4.403: \textit{\textsanskrit{Setaṭṭhikā} \textsanskrit{nāma} \textsanskrit{rogajātīti} eko \textsanskrit{pāṇako} \textsanskrit{nāḷimajjhagataṁ} \textsanskrit{kaṇḍaṁ} vijjhati, yena \textsanskrit{viddhattā} nikkhantampi \textsanskrit{sālisīsaṁ} \textsanskrit{khīraṁ} \textsanskrit{gahetuṁ} na sakkoti}, “The disease called \textit{\textsanskrit{setaṭṭhikā}} means: an insect penetrates the stem, goes to the middle of the stalk, from the penetration of which the rice grains are not able to get sap.” This seems to be a description of so-called “whiteheads”, pale panicles without rice grains, caused by stem borers. } 

The\marginnote{1.1.4} monks considered the difficult circumstances, and they thought, “How can we live together in peace and harmony, have a comfortable rains, and get almsfood without trouble?” 

Some\marginnote{1.1.5} said, “We could work for the householders, and they’ll support us in return.” 

Others\marginnote{1.1.7} said, “There’s no need to work for the householders. Let’s instead take messages for them, and they’ll support us in return.” 

Still\marginnote{1.1.10} others said, “There’s no need to do work or take messages for them. Let’s instead talk up one another’s superhuman qualities to the householders: ‘That monk has the first absorption, that monk the second absorption, that monk the third, that monk the fourth; that monk is a stream-enterer, that monk a once-returner, that a non-returner, that a perfected one; that monk has the three true insights, and that the six direct knowledges.’ Then they’ll support us. In this way we’ll have a comfortable rains, live together in peace and harmony, and get almsfood without trouble. This is the way to go.” 

Then\marginnote{1.1.16} those monks did just that. And the people there thought, “We’re so fortunate that such monks have come to us for the rainy-season residence. Such virtuous and good monks have never before entered the rains residence with us.” And they gave such food and drink to those monks that they did not even eat and drink themselves, or give to their parents, to their wives and children, to their slaves, servants, and workers, to their friends and companions, or to their relatives. Soon those monks had a good color, bright faces, clear skin, and sharp senses. 

Now\marginnote{1.2.1} it was the custom for monks who had completed the rainy-season residence to go and visit the Buddha. And so, when the three months were over and they had completed the rains residence, those monks put their dwellings in order, took their bowls and robes, and set out for \textsanskrit{Vesālī}. When they eventually arrived, they went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. There they approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. 

At\marginnote{1.2.5} that time the monks who had completed the rains residence in that region were thin, haggard and pale, with veins protruding all over their bodies. Yet the monks from the banks of the \textsanskrit{Vaggumudā} had a good color, bright faces, clear skin, and  sharp senses. 

Since\marginnote{1.2.7} it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly-arrived monks, the Buddha said to them,  “I hope you’re keeping well, monks, I hope you’re getting by?  I hope you had a comfortable and harmonious rains, and got almsfood without trouble?” 

“We’re\marginnote{1.2.11} keeping well, sir, we’re getting by. We had a comfortable and harmonious rains, and got almsfood without trouble.” 

When\marginnote{1.2.13} Buddhas know what is going on, sometimes they ask and sometimes not. They know the right time to ask and when not to ask. Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, otherwise not, for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial.\footnote{“Incapable of doing” renders \textit{\textsanskrit{setughāta}}, literally, “destroyed the bridge”. Sp 1.16: \textit{Setu vuccati maggo, maggeneva \textsanskrit{tādisassa} vacanassa \textsanskrit{ghāto}, samucchedoti \textsanskrit{vuttaṁ} hoti}, “The path is called the bridge. What is said is that there is the destruction and cutting off of such speech by the path.” The commentary seems to take \textit{setu}, “bridge”, as a reference to the eightfold path. I prefer to understand “bridge” as a metaphor for access, that is, the Buddhas no longer have the possibility of doing what is unbeneficial. } Buddhas question the monks for two reasons: to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule. 

And\marginnote{1.2.18} the Buddha said to those monks, “In what way, monks, did you have a comfortable and harmonious rains? And how did you get almsfood without trouble?” 

They\marginnote{1.2.19} then told him. 

“But\marginnote{1.2.20} did you really have those superhuman qualities?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.2.21} sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.2.22} Buddha rebuked them, “How could you for the sake of your stomachs talk up one another’s superhuman qualities to householders? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\begin{description}%
\item[Tells: ] if a monk means to say to a person who is not fully ordained, “I attained the first absorption,” but actually says, “I attained the second absorption,” then, if the listener understands, he commits an offense entailing confession; if the listener does not understand, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.\footnote{“If the listener understands” renders \textit{\textsanskrit{paṭivijānantassa}}. This is in accordance with Sp 1.219, which has this to say: \textit{Atha pana yassa \textsanskrit{āroceti}, so na \textsanskrit{jānāti} “ki \textsanskrit{ayaṁ} \textsanskrit{bhaṇatī}”ti, \textsanskrit{saṁsayaṁ} \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{āpajjati}, \textsanskrit{ciraṁ} \textsanskrit{vīmaṁsitvā} \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{pacchā} \textsanskrit{jānāti}, \textsanskrit{appaṭivijānanto} icceva \textsanskrit{saṅkhyaṁ} gacchati}, “When he who is informed does not understand, thinking, ‘What does he say?’ or he has doubt, or he understands after reflecting for a long time, then it is considered ‘one who does not understand.’” Grammatically \textit{\textsanskrit{paṭivijānantassa}} could refer to either the speaker or the listener (it can be regarded as a genitive agreeing with \textit{\textsanskrit{bhaṇantassa}}, thus referring to the speaker, or it can be regarded as a dative of the person spoken to, that is, the listener), but logically it seems it must refer to the listener. In accordance with common usage, “understanding” (\textit{\textsanskrit{paṭivijānantassa}}) must refer to understanding the overall meaning of what is said, not to knowing the exact words that have been spoken. Since the speaker knows he is lying, he understands the overall meaning. It follows that the understanding here must refer to the listener. A parallel construction is found at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali\#8.4.10}{Bu Pj 1:8.4.10} where \textit{\textsanskrit{paṭivijānāti}} is used in connection with giving up the monastic training. Here the verb clearly refers to understanding on the part of the listener, that is, one has only succeeded in renouncing the training if the listener understands what one is saying. At \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3/en/brahmali\#4.1.4}{Bu Ss 3:4.1.4} the same verb, this time in the aorist form \textit{\textsanskrit{paṭivijāni}}, again refers to the listener. } %

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, Venerable Upananda the Sakyan was quarreling with the monks from the group of six. 

He\marginnote{1.3} then committed an offense of intentional emission of semen. He asked the Sangha for probation for that offense, which he received. Just then an association in \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} was offering a meal to the Sangha. Because Upananda was on probation, he sat on the last seat in the dining hall. The monks from the group of six then told those lay followers, “This Venerable Upananda, the esteemed associate of your families, eats the food given in faith with the same hand he uses to masturbate. After committing an offense of intentional emission of semen, he asked the Sangha for probation for that offense, which he received. And because he’s on probation, he now sits on the last seat.” 

The\marginnote{1.12} monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How could the monks from the group of six tell a person who’s not fully ordained about a monk’s grave offense?” … “Is it true, monks, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.15} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.16} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

At that time the monks of \textsanskrit{Āḷavī} were doing building work, and they cut down trees and had them cut down. Then, when a certain monk was cutting down a tree, the deity that lived in it said to him, “Venerable, don’t cut down our dwelling because you want to build a dwelling for yourself.” Not taking any heed, he just cut it down, and he hurt the arm of that deity’s child. The deity thought, “Why don’t I just kill this monk?” But then it reconsidered, “It wouldn’t be right to just kill this monk. Let me instead tell the Buddha about this matter.” And it approached the Buddha and told him what had happened. 

“Well\marginnote{1.13} done, deity! It’s good that you didn’t kill that monk. If you had killed that monk, you would have made much demerit. The tree over there is empty. Take that as your dwelling.”

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Kosambī} in Ghosita’s Monastery, Venerable Channa was misbehaving. Then, when he was examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha, he spoke evasively, “Who has committed an offense? What offense was committed? In regard to what was it committed? How was it committed? Who are you talking about? What are you talking about?” 

The\marginnote{1.4} monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How can Venerable Channa speak evasively when examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha?”… “Is it true, Channa, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.9} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.10} Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking him … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Well then, monks, the Sangha should charge Channa with evasive speech. And he is to be charged like this. A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 

‘Please,\marginnote{1.19} venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The monk Channa speaks evasively when examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha. If the Sangha is ready, it should charge him with evasive speech. This is the motion. 

Please,\marginnote{1.23} venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The monk Channa speaks evasively when examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha. The Sangha is charging him with evasive speech. Any monk who approves of charging him with evasive speech should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. 

The\marginnote{1.28} Sangha has charged the monk Channa with evasive speech. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’” 

After\marginnote{1.30} rebuking Channa in many ways, the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk speaks evasively, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.33} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Later,\marginnote{2.1} when Channa was again being examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha, he thought, “By speaking evasively I’ll commit an offense,” and he instead harassed the Sangha by remaining silent. 

The\marginnote{2.3} monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “When he’s examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha, how can Venerable Channa harass the Sangha by remaining silent?” … “Is it true, Channa, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{2.6} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{2.7} Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking him … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Well then, monks, the Sangha should charge Channa with harassment. And he is to be charged like this. A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 

‘Please,\marginnote{2.15} venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The monk Channa, when examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha, harasses the Sangha by remaining silent. If the Sangha is ready, it should charge him with harassment. This is the motion. 

Please,\marginnote{2.19} venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The monk Channa, when examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha, harasses the Sangha by remaining silent. The Sangha is charging him with harassment. Any monk who approves of charging him of harassment should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. 

The\marginnote{2.24} Sangha has charged the monk Channa with harassment. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’” 

After\marginnote{2.26} rebuking Channa in many ways, the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … “And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk speaks evasively or harasses, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”\footnote{There is no equivalent of the “or” in the Pali, but it is implied by the origin story, which gives a separate offense for speaking evasively. } }

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. At that time Venerable Dabba the Mallian was assigning the dwellings and designating the meals, and the monks Mettiya and \textsanskrit{Bhūmajaka} were newly ordained. They had little merit, getting inferior dwellings and meals. They then complained about Dabba to other monks, “Dabba the Mallian assigns dwellings and designates meals based on favoritism.” 

The\marginnote{1.7} monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can the monks Mettiya and \textsanskrit{Bhūmajaka} complain about Venerable Dabba to other monks?”… “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.10} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.11} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk complains, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.16} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Knowing\marginnote{2.1} that the Buddha had prohibited complaining, the monks Mettiya and \textsanskrit{Bhūmajaka} thought of other ways of getting the monks to hear about their grievances. They then criticized Dabba the Mallian in the vicinity of other monks, “Dabba assigns dwellings and designates meals based on favoritism.” 

The\marginnote{2.4} monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can the monks Mettiya and \textsanskrit{Bhūmajaka} criticize Venerable Dabba?”… “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{2.7} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{2.8} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk complains or criticizes, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”\footnote{There is no equivalent of the “or” in the Pali, but it is implied by the origin story, which gives a separate offense for complaining. } }

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery during winter, the monks put furniture out in the open in order to warm themselves in the sun. But when the time for departure was announced, they departed without putting it away, having it put away, or informing anyone.\footnote{For the meaning of \textit{\textsanskrit{senāsana}}, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } The furniture was rained on. 

The\marginnote{1.1.4} monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How could those monks put furniture out in the open and then depart without putting it away, having it put away, or informing anyone? The furniture was rained on.” 

After\marginnote{1.1.6} rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that you did this?” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\scrule{‘If a monk takes a bed, a bench, a mattress, or a stool belonging to the Sangha and puts it out in the open or has it put out in the open, and he then departs without putting it away, having it put away, or informing anyone, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.1.10} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{1.2.1} afterwards, monks who had stayed out in the open brought the furniture back even though it was not the rainy season. The Buddha saw this. After giving a teaching, he addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, during the eight months outside of the rainy season, I allow you to store furniture under a roof cover or at the foot of a tree or wherever crows or ravens don’t leave droppings.” }

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time two monks were staying in a dwelling with an upper story belonging to the Sangha, one staying below and one above. The monk above sat down hastily on a bed with detachable legs. A leg fell off and hit the monk below on the head. He cried out. Monks rushed up and asked him why, and he told them what had happened. 

The\marginnote{1.9} monks of few desires complained and criticized him, 

“How\marginnote{1.10} could a monk sit down hastily on a bed with detachable legs on an upper story in a dwelling belonging to the Sangha?” 

After\marginnote{1.11} rebuking that monk in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monk, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.13} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.14} Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Kosambī} in Ghosita’s Monastery, a government official who was Venerable Channa’s supporter was making him a dwelling. When the dwelling was finished, Channa had it roofed and plastered over and over. Being overloaded, the dwelling collapsed. Then, while collecting grass and sticks, Channa spoiled the barley field belonging to a certain brahmin. That brahmin complained and criticized him, “How can the venerables spoil my barley field?” 

The\marginnote{1.8} monks heard the complaints of that brahmin, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized Channa, “How could Venerable Channa have a finished dwelling roofed and plastered over and over until it collapsed from overloading?” 

After\marginnote{1.11} rebuking him in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Channa: “Is it true, Channa, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.13} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.14} Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘When a monk is building a large dwelling, then standing where there are no cultivated plants, he may apply two or three layers of roofing material, taking it as far as the doorcase and using it for fixing the door and for treating the window openings.

\subsection*{Definitions }

\begin{description}%
\item[A large dwelling: ] one with an owner is what is meant. %
\item[A dwelling: ] plastered inside or plastered outside or plastered both inside and outside. %
\item[Is building: ] building it himself or having it built. %
\item[As far as the doorcase: ] a distance of an arm’s reach next to the door frame. %
\item[For fixing the door:\footnote{Sp 3.135: \textit{\textsanskrit{Aggaḷaṭṭhapanāyāti} \textsanskrit{sakavāṭakadvārabandhaṭṭhapanāya}; \textsanskrit{sakavāṭakassa} \textsanskrit{dvārabandhassa} \textsanskrit{niccalabhāvatthāyāti} attho}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Aggaḷaṭṭhapanāya}}: for the fixing of the doorframe together with the door panel. It is for the purpose of making the doorframe together with the door panel stable: this is the meaning.” } ] for the fixing of the door. %
\item[For treating the window openings: ] for treating the window openings there is white color, black color, and treating with red ocher; and there is making a garland pattern, a creeper pattern, a shark-teeth pattern, and the fivefold pattern.\footnote{“A shark-teeth pattern” renders \textit{makaradantaka}, literally, “with teeth like a \textit{makara}”. In later Buddhism the \textit{makara} is the name of a mythological marine animal, but what it refers to in this context is not clear. According to Sp-yoj 4.243 \textit{makara} is the name of a certain species of fish: \textit{Makaradantaketi \textsanskrit{makaranāmakassa} macchassa dantasadise dante}, “Teeth like the teeth of a fish called \textit{makara}.” Vin-vn-\textsanskrit{ṭ} 3048, \textit{Makaradantakanti \textsanskrit{girikūṭākāraṁ}}, “\textit{Makaradantaka} means making (a design) like the peak of a hill.” PED suggests “the tooth of a swordfish”, but apparently swordfish do not have teeth. Given that the \textit{makara} were fearsome creatures and that their teeth looked like the peak of a hill, presumably meaning that their teeth were pointed, “shark teeth” seems like a reasonable approximation. | “The fivefold pattern” renders \textit{\textsanskrit{pañcapaṭika}}. Vmv 4.299: \textit{\textsanskrit{Pāḷiyaṁ} \textsanskrit{pañcapaṭikanti} \textsanskrit{jātiādipañcappakāravaṇṇamaṭṭhaṁ}}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Pañcapaṭika}} in the canonical text means treated with the color of the five kinds, starting with jasmine.” The meaning is not clear. It seems unlikely, however, that it should refer to colors, since such have just been listed. } %
\item[Standing where there are no cultivated plants, he may apply two or three layers of roofing material: ] cultivated plants: grain and vegetables; if he applies it while standing where there are cultivated plants, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. For someone covering by the line, after covering with two layers, he may ask for a third layer, and he should then leave.\footnote{“By the line” renders \textit{maggena}. Sp 2.136: \textit{\textsanskrit{Aparikkhipitvā} ujukameva \textsanskrit{chādanaṁ}}, “Not encircling, just straight covering.” As for “two layers”, \textit{dve magge}, the context requires that this refers to lines on top of each other rather than next to each other. The implied purpose of “leave”, \textit{\textsanskrit{pakkamitabbaṁ}}, according to Sp 2.136, is to show that he may not keep on asking: \textit{Sace na pakkamati, \textsanskrit{tuṇhībhūtena} \textsanskrit{ṭhātabbaṁ}}, “If he does not leave, he should stand in silence.” } For someone covering by the layer, after covering with two layers, he may ask for a third layer, and he should then leave.\footnote{Sp 3.126: \textit{\textsanskrit{Pariyāyenāti} parikkhepena}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Pariyāya}}: by encircling.” However, since the word \textit{\textsanskrit{pariyāya}} is used in the sense of “layer” just before, I am assuming the meaning must be the same here. } %
\item[If he applies more than that, even if he stands where there are no cultivated plants: ] if he is covering with bricks, then for every brick, he commits an offense entailing confession. If he is covering with slate, then for every piece of slate, he commits an offense entailing confession. If he is covering with plaster, then for every lump, he commits an offense entailing confession. If he is covering with grass, then for every handful, he commits an offense entailing confession.

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time the senior monks who were instructing the nuns received robe-cloth, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal supplies. When the monks from the group of six found out about this, they thought, “Well then, let’s instruct the nuns.” They then went to the nuns and said, “Come to us, Sisters, and we too will instruct you.” 

Soon\marginnote{1.7} afterwards those nuns went to the monks from the group of six, bowed, and sat down. But after giving just a short teaching, those monks spent the day on worldly talk. They then dismissed the nuns, saying, “Go, Sisters.” 

The\marginnote{1.10} nuns went to the Buddha and bowed, and the Buddha said to them, “Nuns, I hope the instruction was effective?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{1.11} how could the instruction be effective? After giving just a short teaching, the monks from the group of six spent the day on worldly talk, and then dismissed us.” 

The\marginnote{1.13} Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened those nuns with a teaching. The nuns bowed, circumambulated the Buddha with their right sides toward him, and left. 

Soon\marginnote{1.15} afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks from the group of six: “Is it true, monks, that you acted like this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.17} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.18} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how could you act like this? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

“Monks,\marginnote{1.23} you should appoint an instructor of the nuns.\footnote{“Should” renders \textit{\textsanskrit{anujānāmi}}. See Appendix of Technical Terms for discussion. } And this is how he should be appointed. First a monk should be asked and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 

‘Please,\marginnote{1.27} venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. If the Sangha is ready, it should appoint monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns. This is the motion. 

Please,\marginnote{1.30} venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns. Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. 

For\marginnote{1.34} the second time, I speak on this matter. … For the third time, I speak on this matter. Please, venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns. Any monk who approves of appointing monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. 

The\marginnote{1.40} Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as an instructor of the nuns. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’” 

Then,\marginnote{1.42} after rebuking the monks from the group of six in many ways, the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk who has not been appointed instructs the nuns, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.45} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

After\marginnote{2.1} being appointed to do so, the senior monks who instructed the nuns still received robe-cloth, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal supplies. When they found out about this, the monks from the group of six said, “Well then, let’s go outside the monastery zone, appoint each other as instructors of the nuns, and then instruct them.” After doing just that, they again went to the nuns and said, “Sisters, we too have been appointed. Come to us, and we will instruct you.” 

Once\marginnote{2.7} again the nuns went to the monks from the group of six and everything unfolded as before. 

The\marginnote{2.16} Buddha then had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks from the group of six: “Is it true, monks, that you acted like this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{2.20} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{2.21} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how could you act like this? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

“Monks,\marginnote{2.26} you may appoint a monk who possesses eight qualities as an instructor of the nuns:\footnote{This set of eight qualities is also found at \href{https://suttacentral.net/an8.52/en/brahmali\#2.1}{AN 8.52:2.1}. } 

\begin{enumerate}%
\item He is virtuous and restrained by the Monastic Code. His conduct is good, he associates with the right people, and he sees danger in minor faults. He undertakes and trains in the training rules. %
\item He has learned much, and he retains and accumulates what he has learned. Those teachings that are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, that have a true goal and are well articulated, and that set out the perfectly complete and pure spiritual life—he has learned many such teachings, retained them in mind, recited them verbally, mentally investigated them, and penetrated them well by view. %
\item He has properly learned both Monastic Codes in detail. He has analyzed them well, thoroughly mastered them, and investigated them well, both in terms of the rules and their detailed exposition. %
\item He is well-spoken and has a good voice. %
\item He is generally liked by and pleasing to the nuns. %
\item He is capable of instructing the nuns. %
\item He has never committed a heavy offense against a Buddhist nun. %
\item He has been fully ordained for at least twenty years. %
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, the senior monks were taking turns instructing the nuns. Then, on one occasion, it was Venerable \textsanskrit{Cūḷapanthaka}’s turn. The nuns said, “Today the instruction won’t be effective. Venerable \textsanskrit{Cūḷapanthaka} will just be repeating the same thing over and over.” 

Soon\marginnote{1.4} afterwards those nuns went to \textsanskrit{Cūḷapanthaka}, bowed, and sat down. \textsanskrit{Cūḷapanthaka} then said to them, “Are you all here, Sisters?”\footnote{“Are you all here” renders \textit{\textsanskrit{samaggāttha}}, literally, “are you united”. Sp 2.149: \textit{\textsanskrit{Samaggātthāti} \textsanskrit{sabbā} \textsanskrit{āgatatthāti} attho}, “Are you united: the meaning is ‘Have you all come?’” } 

“We’re\marginnote{1.6} all here, venerable.” 

“Are\marginnote{1.7} you keeping the eight important principles?” 

“We\marginnote{1.8} are.” 

After\marginnote{1.9} saying, “This is the instruction,” he uttered the same heartfelt exclamation again and again: 

\begin{verse}%
“For\marginnote{1.10} the heedful one possessed of the higher mind, \\
For the sage training on the path to sagacity—\\
There are no sorrows for such a one, \\
The peaceful one, who is always mindful.” 

%
\end{verse}

And\marginnote{1.14} the nuns said, “Didn’t we say that the instruction wouldn’t be effective, that Venerable \textsanskrit{Cūḷapanthaka} would just be repeating the same thing over and over?” \textsanskrit{Cūḷapanthaka} overheard that conversation between the nuns. He then rose up into the air, walked back and forth in space, and he stood, sat down, and lay down there. He emitted smoke and fire, and he disappeared, all the while uttering the same heartfelt exclamation and many other sayings by the Buddha. The nuns said, “It’s astonishing and amazing! No previous instruction has been as effective as this one from Venerable \textsanskrit{Cūḷapanthaka}!” And \textsanskrit{Cūḷapanthaka} kept on instructing those nuns until the dark of night and then dismissed them, saying, “Go, Sisters.” 

But\marginnote{1.21} because the gates to town were closed, those nuns spent the night outside and only entered early in the morning. People complained and criticized them, “These nuns aren’t celibate. They spend the night in the monastery with the monks and only now do they enter town.” 

The\marginnote{1.24} monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized \textsanskrit{Cūḷapanthaka}, “How could Venerable \textsanskrit{Cūḷapanthaka} instruct the nuns after the sun has set?”… “Is it true, \textsanskrit{Cūḷapanthaka}, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.28} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.29} Buddha rebuked him … “\textsanskrit{Cūḷapanthaka}, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country in the Banyan Tree Monastery at Kapilavatthu, the monks from the group of six went to the nuns’ dwelling place and instructed the nuns from the group of six. 

Soon\marginnote{1.3} afterwards, other nuns said to the nuns from the group of six, “Come, venerables, let’s go to the instruction.” 

“There’s\marginnote{1.5} no need. The monks from the group of six came and instructed us right here.” 

The\marginnote{1.6} nuns complained and criticized the monks from the group of six, “How could the monks from the group of six go and instruct the nuns at their dwelling place?” Then those nuns told the monks. 

The\marginnote{1.9} monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How could those monks do this?”… “Is it true, monks, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.12} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.13} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk goes to the nuns’ dwelling place, and then instructs them, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.18} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards \textsanskrit{Mahāpajāpati} \textsanskrit{Gotamī} became sick. The senior monks went to see her and said, “We hope you’re bearing up, \textsanskrit{Gotamī}, we hope you’re getting better?” 

“I’m\marginnote{2.5} not bearing up, venerables, and I’m not getting better. Please give me a teaching.” 

“It’s\marginnote{2.7} not allowable for us to go and teach the nuns at their dwelling place.” And being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not teach her. 

Soon\marginnote{2.8} afterwards, after robing up in the morning, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to \textsanskrit{Mahāpajāpati} \textsanskrit{Gotamī} where he sat down on the prepared seat. He said to her, “I hope you’re bearing up, \textsanskrit{Gotamī}, I hope you’re getting better?” 

“Previously,\marginnote{2.11} sir, the senior monks would come and teach me, and because of that I would be comfortable. But now that this has been prohibited by the Buddha, they don’t teach because they’re afraid of wrongdoing. Because of that I’m not comfortable.” 

After\marginnote{2.15} instructing, inspiring, and gladdening her with a teaching, the Buddha got up from his seat and left. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to go and instruct a sick nun at her dwelling place. }

And\marginnote{2.18} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

On\marginnote{1.1} one occasion when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, a certain monk was walking for almsfood along a street in \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}, as was a certain nun. That monk said to that nun, “Go to such-and-such a place, Sister, and you’ll get alms,” and she said the same to him. And because they met frequently, they became friends. 

Just\marginnote{1.6} then robe-cloth belonging to the Sangha was being distributed. Then, after going to the instruction, that nun went to that monk and bowed. He then said to her, “Sister, will you accept my share of the robe-cloth?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.9} venerable, my robes are worn.” 

And\marginnote{1.10} he gave his robe-cloth to that nun. As a consequence, his robes, too, became worn. Other monks said to him, “Why don’t you make a robe for yourself?” And he told them what had happened. 

The\marginnote{1.14} monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How could a monk give robe-cloth to a nun?” … “Is it true, monk, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.17} true, sir.” 

“Is\marginnote{1.18} she a relative of yours?” 

“No.”\marginnote{1.19} 

“Foolish\marginnote{1.20} man, a man and a woman who are unrelated don’t know what’s appropriate and inappropriate, what’s good and bad, in dealing with each other. And still you did this. This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk gives robe-cloth to an unrelated nun, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.25} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Once\marginnote{2.1} this had happened, the monks did not even give robe-cloth to the nuns in exchange, being afraid of wrongdoing. The nuns complained and criticized them, “How can they not give us robe-cloth in exchange?” 

The\marginnote{2.4} monks heard the complaints of those nuns and they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to give things in exchange to five kinds of people: monks, nuns, trainee nuns, novice monks, and novice nuns. }

And\marginnote{2.10} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk gives robe-cloth to an unrelated nun, except in exchange, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time Venerable \textsanskrit{Udāyī} had become skilled in making robes. On one occasion a certain nun went to \textsanskrit{Udāyī} and said to him, “Venerable, would you please sew me a robe?” 

He\marginnote{1.5} then sewed a robe for that nun, well-dyed and beautifully made, and he drew a picture in the middle of it. He then folded it and put it aside.\footnote{“Picture” renders \textit{\textsanskrit{paṭibhānacittaṁ}}. Sp 2.175: \textit{\textsanskrit{Paṭibhānacittanti} attano \textsanskrit{paṭibhānena} \textsanskrit{katacittaṁ}, so kira \textsanskrit{cīvaraṁ} \textsanskrit{rajitvā} tassa majjhe \textsanskrit{nānāvaṇṇehi} \textsanskrit{vippakatamethunaṁ} \textsanskrit{itthipurisarūpamakāsi}}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Paṭibhānacitta}}: a picture made through one’s own impromptu imagination. After dyeing the robe, he made a multi-colored picture in the middle of a man and a woman having sexual intercourse.” } Soon afterwards that nun went to \textsanskrit{Udāyī} and said, “Sir, where’s the robe?” 

“Now,\marginnote{1.8} Sister, take this robe as it’s folded and put it aside. When the Sangha of nuns goes to the instruction, then put it on and follow right behind the other nuns.” 

And\marginnote{1.9} that nun did just that. People complained and criticized her, “How indecent these nuns are, what shameless scoundrels, in drawing pictures on their robes!” 

The\marginnote{1.12} nuns asked her, “Who did this?” 

“Venerable\marginnote{1.14} \textsanskrit{Udāyī}.” 

“This\marginnote{1.15} sort of work would not even make an indecent, shameless scoundrel look good, let alone Venerable \textsanskrit{Udāyī}.”

“It’s\marginnote{1.20} true, sir.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. At that time the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} was associating with a family from which she received a regular meal. 

Now\marginnote{1.3} on one occasion the head of that family had invited some senior monks. On the same day, the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} robed up in the morning, took her bowl and robe, and went to that family. And she asked the head of the family, “Why have you prepared so much food?” 

“’Cause,\marginnote{1.6} venerable, I’ve invited the senior monks.” 

“But\marginnote{1.7} who are those senior monks?” 

“Venerable\marginnote{1.8} \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna}, Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahākaccāna}, Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahākoṭṭhika}, Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahākappina}, Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahācunda}, Venerable Anuruddha, Venerable Revata, Venerable \textsanskrit{Upāli}, Venerable Ānanda, and Venerable \textsanskrit{Rāhula}.” 

“But\marginnote{1.9} why do you invite such inferior monks instead of the great ones?” 

“Who\marginnote{1.10} are these great monks?” “Venerable Devadatta, Venerable \textsanskrit{Kokālika}, Venerable \textsanskrit{Kaṭamodakatissaka}, Venerable \textsanskrit{Khaṇḍadeviyāputta}, and Venerable Samuddadatta.” 

While\marginnote{1.12} this conversation was taking place, the senior monks entered. \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} said, “Is it true that you’ve invited these great monks?” 

“Just\marginnote{1.14} before you called them inferior and now you call them great.” And that lay person threw her out of the house and made an end of her regular meal. 

The\marginnote{1.16} monks of few desires complained and criticized Devadatta, “How could Devadatta eat almsfood knowing that a nun had it prepared?” … “Is it true, Devadatta, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.19} true, sir.”

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards a monk who had earlier left \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} returned to see his family. Because it was a long time since he had last returned, people prepared food for him respectfully. And the nun who was associating with that family said to them, “Give food to that monk.” The monk thought, “The Buddha has prohibited us from eating almsfood knowing that a nun had it prepared,” and being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not accept it. And because he was unable to walk for alms, he missed his meal. 

After\marginnote{2.8} returning to the monastery, he told the monks what had happened, and they in turn told the Buddha. 

Soon\marginnote{2.10} afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to eat almsfood knowing that a nun had it prepared if the householder had intended to prepare it anyway. }

And\marginnote{2.12} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, Venerable \textsanskrit{Udāyī}’s ex-wife became a nun.

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, a certain association was preparing an almsmeal at a public guesthouse not far from \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

Then,\marginnote{1.3} after robing up in the morning, the monks from the group of six took their bowls and robes and entered \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} for alms. Not getting anything, they went to that public guesthouse. Because it was a long time since they had been there, people served them respectfully. 

A\marginnote{1.5} second and a third day those monks did the same thing. Then they thought, “What’s the point of returning to the monastery? Tomorrow we’ll just have to come back here.” So they stayed on and on right there, eating alms at the guesthouse, while the monastics of other religions left. People complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan monastics stay on and on, eating alms at the guesthouse? We don’t prepare the almsfood just for them; we prepare it for everyone.” 

The\marginnote{1.15} monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How could the monks from the group of six stay on and on, eating alms at a public guesthouse?” … “Is it true, monks, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.19} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.20} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk eats more than one almsmeal at a public guesthouse, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.25} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} was traveling through the Kosalan country on his way to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} when he came to a public guesthouse. Because it was a long time since he had been there, people served him respectfully. After he had eaten, \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} became severely ill, and he was unable to leave that guesthouse. 

On\marginnote{2.4} the second day, too, those people said to him, “Please eat, venerable.” But since he knew that the Buddha had prohibited eating alms at a public guesthouse after staying on and on, and because he was afraid of wrongdoing, he did not accept. As a consequence, he missed his meal. 

When\marginnote{2.9} he arrived at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}, he told the monks what had happened, and they in turn told the Buddha. 

Soon\marginnote{2.11} afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow a sick monk to stay on at a public guesthouse and eat alms there. }

And\marginnote{2.13} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk who is not sick eats more than one almsmeal at a public guesthouse, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. At that time, because of his loss of material support and honor, Devadatta and his followers had to ask families repeatedly to get invited to meals. People complained and criticized him, “How can the Sakyan monastics repeatedly ask families to get invited to meals? Who doesn’t like nice food? Who doesn’t prefer tasty food?” 

The\marginnote{1.6} monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How can Devadatta and his followers repeatedly ask families to get invited to meals?” … “Is it true, Devadatta, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.10} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.11} Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{First preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk eats in a group, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.16} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards people invited sick monks to a meal. But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow a sick monk to eat in a group. }

And\marginnote{2.6} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Second preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk eats in a group, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession. This is the appropriate occasion: he is sick.’” }

In\marginnote{2.9} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Third sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{3.1} afterwards, during the robe-giving season, people prepared a meal together with robe-cloth and then invited the monks, saying, “We wish to offer a meal and then give robe-cloth.” But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. As a result, they only got a small amount of robe-cloth. They told the Buddha. … 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to eat in a group during the robe-giving season. }

And\marginnote{3.7} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

In\marginnote{4.8} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Fifth sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{5.1} afterwards some monks went traveling with a group of people. The monks said to those people, “Please wait a moment while we walk for alms.” They replied, “Venerables, please eat right here.” But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. They told the Buddha. … 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to eat in a group when you’re traveling. }

In\marginnote{5.12} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Sixth sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{6.1} afterwards some monks were traveling by boat with a group of people. The monks said to those people, “Please go to the shore for a moment while we walk for alms.” They replied, “Venerables, please eat right here.” But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. They told the Buddha. … 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to eat in a group when on board a boat. }

In\marginnote{6.10} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Seventh sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{7.1} afterwards monks who had completed the rainy-season residence in various regions were coming to \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} to visit the Buddha. People saw those monks who had come from various countries and invited them for a meal. But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. They told the Buddha. … 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to eat in a group on big occasions. }

And\marginnote{7.6} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Seventh preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk eats in a group, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession. These are the appropriate occasions: he is sick; it is the robe-giving season; it is a time of making robes; he is traveling; he is on a boat; it is a big occasion.’” }

In\marginnote{7.9} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Eighth sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{8.1} afterwards a relative of King Seniya \textsanskrit{Bimbisāra} of Magadha who had gone forth with the \textsanskrit{Ājīvaka} ascetics went to the king and said, “Great king, I wish to make a meal for the monastics of all religions.” 

“That’s\marginnote{8.2} fine, sir, if you first feed the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha.” 

“I’ll\marginnote{8.3} do that.” 

And\marginnote{8.4} he sent a message to the monks: “Please accept a meal from me tomorrow.” But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating in a group and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. That \textsanskrit{Ājīvaka} ascetic then went to the Buddha, exchanged pleasantries with him, and said, “Good Gotama has gone forth and so have I. One who has gone forth should receive alms from another who has gone forth. Good Gotama, please accept a meal from me tomorrow together with the Sangha of monks.” The Buddha consented by remaining silent. The \textsanskrit{Ājīvaka} understood that the Buddha had consented, and he left. 

Soon\marginnote{8.12} afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to eat in a group when the meal is given by a monastic. }

And\marginnote{8.14} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood near \textsanskrit{Vesālī}, a succession of fine meals had been arranged in \textsanskrit{Vesālī}. A certain poor worker thought, “Why don’t I prepare a meal? It must be really worthwhile, seeing as these people prepare a meal with such respect.” 

He\marginnote{1.4} then went to his boss Kira and said, “Sir, I wish to prepare a meal for the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha. Please give me my salary.” Because Kira also had faith and confidence, he gave the worker his salary and much extra. Soon afterwards that worker went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said, “Sir, please accept a meal from me tomorrow together with the Sangha of monks.” 

“The\marginnote{1.10} Sangha is large.” 

“No\marginnote{1.11} problem! I’ve prepared much jujube, supplemented with jujube drinks.” The Buddha consented by remaining silent, and the worker understood. 

He\marginnote{1.14} got up from his seat, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 

The\marginnote{1.15} monks heard that a poor worker had invited the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha on the following day for a meal supplemented with jujube drinks. And so they ate in the morning after walking for alms. 

When\marginnote{1.17} people heard that a poor worker had invited the Sangha of monks headed by the Buddha for a meal, they brought much food of various kinds to him. The following morning that worker prepared his food, and then had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready. 

The\marginnote{1.19} Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe and, together with the Sangha of monks, went to the house of that poor worker where he sat down on the prepared seat in the dining hall. The worker served the monks, but they kept saying, “Give just a little.” 

“Venerables,\marginnote{1.22} don’t accept so little because you think I’m just a poor worker. I’ve prepared much food of various kinds. Please accept as much as you like.” 

“We’re\marginnote{1.25} not accepting so little because of that, but because we ate in the morning after walking for alms.” 

That\marginnote{1.27} poor worker complained and criticized them, “How could the venerables eat elsewhere when invited by me? Am I not able to give as much as they need?” 

The\marginnote{1.30} monks heard the complaints of that worker, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How could those monks eat elsewhere when invited for a meal?” … “Is it true, monks, that monks did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.34} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.35} Buddha rebuked them … “How could those foolish men do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{First preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk eats a meal before another, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.40} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards a certain monk became sick. Another monk took some almsfood, went to that monk, and told him to eat it. 

“I\marginnote{2.3} can’t. I’m expecting another meal.” 

But\marginnote{2.4} since that almsfood only arrived at midday, that monk did not get to eat as much as he had intended. They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow a sick monk to eat a meal before another. }

And\marginnote{2.8} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Second preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk eats a meal before another, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession. This is the appropriate occasion: he is sick.’” }

In\marginnote{2.11} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Third sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{3.1} afterwards, during the robe-giving season, people prepared a meal together with robe-cloth and then invited the monks, saying, “We wish to offer a meal and give robe-cloth.” But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating a meal before another and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. As a result, they only got a small amount of robe-cloth. They told the Buddha. … 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to eat a meal before another during the robe-giving season. }

And\marginnote{3.6} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Third preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk eats a meal before another, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession. These are the appropriate occasions: he is sick; it is the robe-giving season.’” }

In\marginnote{3.9} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Fourth sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{3.10.1} afterwards people invited the robe-making monks for a meal. But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating a meal before another and being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not accept. They told the Buddha. … 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to eat a meal before another at a time when you are making robes. }

And\marginnote{3.14} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk eats a meal before another, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession. These are the appropriate occasions: he is sick; it is the robe-giving season; it is a time of making robes.’” }

In\marginnote{3.17} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Fifth sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{4.1} afterwards, after robing up in the morning, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to a certain family with Venerable Ānanda as his attendant. He sat down on the prepared seat, and the people there gave cooked food. Being afraid of wrongdoing, Ānanda did not accept it. The Buddha said, “Accept it, Ānanda.” 

“I\marginnote{4.5} can’t, sir, I’m expecting another meal.” 

“Well\marginnote{4.6} then, Ānanda, assign that meal to someone else and then receive this.” 

Soon\marginnote{4.7} afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to eat a meal before another if you assign the other meal to someone else. }

And,\marginnote{4.9} monks, this is how it should be assigned: ‘I give my expected meal to so-and-so.’”

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time there was a female lay follower \textsanskrit{Kāṇamātā} who had faith and confidence. She had a daughter, \textsanskrit{Kāṇā}, who had been given in marriage to a man in a certain village. 

On\marginnote{1.1.4} one occasion \textsanskrit{Kāṇā} went to her mother’s house on some business. \textsanskrit{Kāṇā}’s husband sent her a message: “Please come, \textsanskrit{Kāṇā}, I want you back.” \textsanskrit{Kāṇamātā} thought, “It’s shameful to go empty-handed,” and she baked some cookies. Just when the cookies were finished, an alms-collecting monk entered \textsanskrit{Kāṇamātā}’s house, and she gave him some. After leaving, he told another monk, and he too was given cookies. And the same happened a third time. At that, all the cookies were gone. 

A\marginnote{1.1.11} second time \textsanskrit{Kāṇā}’s husband sent her the same message, and everything unfolded as before. 

A\marginnote{1.1.18} third time he sent the same message, adding, “If \textsanskrit{Kāṇā} doesn’t come, I’ll find another wife.” But once again all the cookies were given to monks. \textsanskrit{Kāṇā}’s husband found another wife, and when \textsanskrit{Kāṇā} heard what had happened, she cried. 

Soon\marginnote{1.1.28} afterwards, after robing up in the morning, the Buddha took his bowl and robe and went to \textsanskrit{Kāṇamātā}’s house where he sat down on the prepared seat. \textsanskrit{Kāṇamātā} approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. The Buddha asked her why \textsanskrit{Kāṇā} was crying, and she told him what had happened. After instructing, inspiring, and gladdening her with a teaching, the Buddha got up from his seat and left. 

Soon\marginnote{1.2.1} afterwards a certain caravan was ready to go south from \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}. An alms-collecting monk went up to that caravan to get almsfood, and a lay follower gave him flour products.\footnote{“Flour products” renders \textit{sattu}. See discussion in Appendix of Technical Terms. } After leaving, that monk told another monk, and he too was given flour products. And the same happened a third time. At that, all his provisions were gone. 

That\marginnote{1.2.7} lay follower said to the other people in the caravan, “Sirs, please wait one day. I’ve given my provisions to the monks. I need to prepare more.” 

“We\marginnote{1.2.10} can’t wait. The caravan is already on its way.” And they left. 

After\marginnote{1.2.11} preparing provisions, that lay follower followed after the caravan, but he was robbed by thieves. People complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan monastics receive without moderation? This man gave to them, and then because he was following after the caravan he was robbed by thieves.” 

The\marginnote{1.2.15} monks heard the complaints of those people and they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons: for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad people, for the ease of good monks, for the restraint of the corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of the corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training. And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk goes to a family and is invited to take cookies or crackers, he may accept two or three bowlfuls if he wishes.

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, a certain brahmin had invited the monks for a meal. When the monks had finished and refused an invitation to eat more, they went to their respective families, where some ate and some took away almsfood. 

Soon\marginnote{1.4} afterwards that brahmin said to his neighbors, “The monks have been satisfied by me. Come, and I’ll satisfy you, too.” “How could you satisfy us? Those monks who were invited by you came to our houses. Some of them ate there and some took away almsfood.” 

That\marginnote{1.9} brahmin complained and criticized those monks, “How could the venerables eat in our house and afterwards eat elsewhere? Am I not able to give them as much as they need?” 

The\marginnote{1.12} monks heard the complaints of that brahmin, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How could those monks finish their meal and refuse an invitation to eat more, and then eat elsewhere?” … “Is it true, monks, that monks did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.16} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.17} Buddha rebuked them … “How could those foolish men do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk has finished his meal and refused an invitation to eat more, and then eats fresh or cooked food, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”\footnote{I normally render \textit{\textsanskrit{pavārita}} as “invited”, but the word also means “satisfied”. In the present case, the contextual meaning (see below) is that the monk has expressed his satisfaction after being invited to take more, thus “refused an invitation to eat more”. } }

In\marginnote{1.22} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards the monks were bringing back fine almsfood for the sick monks. But because the sick monks were unable to eat as much as they had intended, the monks threw the leftovers away. When the Buddha heard the loud sound of crows cawing, he asked Venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, why is there this loud sound of crows cawing?” Ānanda told him what had happened, and the Buddha said, 

“But\marginnote{2.8} Ānanda, don’t the monks eat the leftovers from those who are sick?” 

“No,\marginnote{2.9} sir.” 

Soon\marginnote{2.10} afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to eat the leftovers both from those who are sick and from those who are not sick. }

And,\marginnote{2.12} monks, this is how you make food left over: ‘I’ve had enough.’ And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk has finished his meal and refused an invitation to eat more, and then eats fresh or cooked food that is not left over, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time two monks were traveling through the Kosalan country on their way to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. One monk misbehaved and the other said to him, “Don’t do that! It’s not allowable.” Because of that the first monk became resentful. They then carried on to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

Soon\marginnote{1.8} afterwards an association in \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} was offering a meal to the Sangha. When the second monk had finished his meal and refused an invitation to eat more, the resentful monk brought back some almsfood from his own family. He then said to the other, “Please eat!” 

“There’s\marginnote{1.12} no need. I’m full.” 

“The\marginnote{1.13} almsfood is nice, please eat.” 

And\marginnote{1.14} because he was pressured, he ate the almsfood. The resentful monk then said to him, “Who are you to correct me when you eat food that’s not left over even though you have finished your meal and refused an invitation to eat more?” 

“Shouldn’t\marginnote{1.17} you have told me?”\footnote{That is, why did he not say that the food was not left over. } 

“Shouldn’t\marginnote{1.18} you have asked?” 

The\marginnote{1.19} second monk told the monks what had happened, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized the other, “How could a monk invite another monk to eat food that’s not left over, when the other has finished his meal and refused an invitation to eat more ?” … “Is it true, monk, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.23} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.24} Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk invites a monk, whom he knows has finished his meal and refused an invitation to eat more, to eat fresh or cooked food that is not left over, saying, “Here, monk, eat,” aiming to criticize him, then when the other has eaten, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

Perhaps this last form is conformable to sa. \textit{\textsanskrit{ārocayate}} med. caus. in the meaning: he or she makes inquiries (of others).” However, this does not fit with the parallel usage at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29/en/brahmali\#3.1.6}{Bu Pc 29:3.1.6} where the text says that she tells (\textit{\textsanskrit{sā} \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{āroceti}}) him, presumably referring to the nun telling the monk. In this case \textit{\textsanskrit{āroceti}} cannot refer to the monk making inquiries. The commentaries are silent, and I therefore assume that a straightforward meaning is the most likely one.

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} in the Bamboo Grove, there was a hilltop fair in \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, which the monks from the group of seventeen went to see. When people saw the monks, they bathed them, anointed them, fed them cooked food, and gave them fresh food. They took that food and brought it back to the monastery. And they said to the monks from the group of six, “Help yourselves!” 

“But\marginnote{1.7} where did you get this food?” And they told them what had happened. 

“So,\marginnote{1.9} do you eat at the wrong time?” 

“Yes.”\marginnote{1.10} 

The\marginnote{1.11} monks from the group of six complained and criticized them, “How can those monks from the group of seventeen eat at the wrong time?” 

They\marginnote{1.13} told the monks, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can the monks from the group of seventeen eat at the wrong time?” … “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.17} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.18} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

At that time Venerable \textsanskrit{Belaṭṭhasīsa}, Venerable Ānanda’s preceptor, was staying in the wilderness. After walking for alms, he brought plain boiled rice back to the monastery where he dried and stored it. Whenever he got hungry, he moistened and ate it. As a result, he only went the village for alms after a long time. 

The\marginnote{1.5} monks asked him, “Why do you only go for alms after such a long time?” And he told them. 

“But\marginnote{1.8} do you eat food that you’ve stored?” 

“Yes.”\marginnote{1.9} 

The\marginnote{1.10} monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How can Venerable \textsanskrit{Belaṭṭhasīsa} eat food that he has stored?” … “Is it true, \textsanskrit{Belaṭṭhasīsa}, that you do this?”

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, the monks from the group of six were eating fine foods that they had requested for themselves. People complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan monastics eat fine foods that they have requested for themselves? Who doesn’t like nice food? Who doesn’t prefer tasty food?” 

The\marginnote{1.6} monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How can the monks from the group of six eat fine foods that they have requested for themselves?” … “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.10} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.11} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk asks for any of these kinds of fine foods for himself—that is, ghee, butter, oil, honey, syrup, fish, meat, milk, and curd—and then eats it, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.16} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

At\marginnote{2.1} one time a number of monks were sick. The monks who were looking after them asked, “I hope you’re bearing up? I hope you’re getting better?” 

“Previously\marginnote{2.4} we ate fine foods that we had requested ourselves, and then we were comfortable. But now that the Buddha has prohibited this, we don’t request because we’re afraid of wrongdoing. And because of that we’re not comfortable.” 

They\marginnote{2.6} told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow a sick monk to eat fine foods that he has requested for himself. }

And\marginnote{2.9} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk who is not sick asks for any of these kinds of fine foods for himself—that is, ghee, butter, oil, honey, syrup, fish, meat, milk, and curd—and then eats it, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood near \textsanskrit{Vesālī}. At that time a monk who only used discarded things was staying in a charnel ground. He disliked receiving things from people. Instead he would take whatever was offered to the dead at the charnel ground, at the foot of trees, or at the threshold, and he would use that.\footnote{“The threshold”, \textit{\textsanskrit{ummāra}}, would seem to refer the entry point to the charnel ground. Sp-yoj 2.263: \textit{\textsanskrit{Ummārepīti} \textsanskrit{susānassa} \textsanskrit{indakhīlepi}}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Ummārepī}}: also at the entry post to the charnel ground.” } People complained and criticized him, “How can this monk take the offerings to our ancestors and use them?\footnote{Although this is not specified by the text, such offerings would mostly have been food. } This monk is big and strong. He probably eats human flesh too!” 

The\marginnote{1.7} monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How can this monk eat food that hasn’t been given?” … “Is it true, monk, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.11} true, sir.”

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood near \textsanskrit{Vesālī}, the Sangha had an abundance of fresh food. Venerable Ānanda told the Buddha, who said, “Well then, Ānanda, give the cookies to those who take leftovers.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.1.4} sir.” Ānanda had them sit in a row and gave them one cookie each, until he accidentally gave two to a female wanderer. The female wanderers sitting next to her said to her, “This monastic is your lover.” 

“He’s\marginnote{1.1.6} not. He gave me two, thinking they were one.” 

And\marginnote{1.1.7} a second time … And a third time Ānanda gave them one cookie each, until he accidentally gave two to that same female wanderer. Once again the female wanderers sitting next to her said to her, “This monastic is your lover.” 

“He’s\marginnote{1.1.10} not. He gave me two, thinking they were one.” 

And\marginnote{1.1.11} they started to argue about whether or not they were lovers. 

A\marginnote{1.2.1} certain \textsanskrit{Ājīvaka} ascetic, too, went to that distribution of food. A monk mixed rice with a large amount of ghee and gave him a large lump. He took it and left. Another \textsanskrit{Ājīvaka} asked him, “Where did you get that lump?” 

“From\marginnote{1.2.5} the food distribution of the ascetic Gotama, that shaven-headed householder.” 

Some\marginnote{1.2.6} lay followers overheard that conversation between those \textsanskrit{Ājīvaka} ascetics. They then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said, “Sir, these monastics of other religions want to disparage the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Sangha. It would be good if the monks didn’t personally give anything to the monastics of other religions.” 

After\marginnote{1.2.10} the Buddha had instructed, inspired, and gladdened those lay followers with a teaching, they got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated him with their right sides toward him, and left. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons: for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad people, for the ease of good monks, for the restraint of the corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of the corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training. And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

On\marginnote{1.1} one occasion when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, Venerable Upananda the Sakyan said to his brother’s student, “Come, let’s go to the village for alms.” Then, without getting him any food, he sent him away, saying, “Go away! I’m not comfortable talking or sitting with you, but only if I talk and sit by myself.” But since the right time for eating was coming to an end, the student was unable to walk for alms. As he returned to the monastery, there was nobody offering food, and so he missed his meal. 

He\marginnote{1.7} then went to the monastery and told the monks what had happened. The monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda, “How could Venerable Upananda say to a monk, ‘Come, let’s go to the village for alms,’ and then send him away without getting him any food?” … “Is it true, Upananda, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.11} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.12} Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

On\marginnote{1.1} one occasion when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, Venerable Upananda the Sakyan went to the house of a friend and sat down with his wife in their bedroom. The husband approached Upananda, bowed, and sat down. He then said to his wife, “Please give him alms.” And she did so. 

Soon\marginnote{1.6} afterwards he said, “Please leave, sir, the alms have been given.” 

But\marginnote{1.7} the woman, knowing that her husband was lustful, said, “Please sit, sir, don’t go.” 

A\marginnote{1.8} second time and a third time he repeated his request, and both times his wife repeated hers. 

He\marginnote{1.11} then left the house and complained to the monks, “Venerables, Venerable Upananda is seated with my wife in our bedroom. When I ask him to leave because we’re busy, he doesn’t want to go.” 

The\marginnote{1.15} monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda, “How could Venerable Upananda sit down intruding on a lustful couple?” … “Is it true, Upananda, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.18} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.19} Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} in the Bamboo Grove, a family that was supporting Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had invited him to a meal, and they had invited other monks too. But since Upananda was visiting other families before that meal, the other monks said to that family, “Please give the meal.” 

“Please\marginnote{1.7} wait, sirs, until Venerable Upananda arrives.” 

A\marginnote{1.8} second time … A third time those monks said, “Please give the meal before it is too late.” 

“But\marginnote{1.11} we prepared the meal because of Venerable Upananda. Please wait until he arrives.” 

Then,\marginnote{1.13} after visiting those families, Upananda arrived late, and those monks did not eat as much as they had intended. The monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda, “How can Venerable Upananda visit families first when invited to a meal?” … “Is it true, Upananda, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.18} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.19} Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{First preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk who has been invited to a meal visits families beforehand, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.24} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards a family that was supporting Upananda sent fresh food to the Sangha. They instructed that the food should be shown to Upananda and then given to the Sangha. 

But\marginnote{2.3} on that occasion Upananda had gone to the village for alms. When those people arrived at the monastery, they asked for Upananda, and they were told where he was. They said, “Venerables, after showing it to Venerable Upananda, this fresh food is to be given to the Sangha.” The monks told the Buddha, who then gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Well then, monks, receive it and put it aside until Upananda returns.” 

When\marginnote{2.11} he heard that the Buddha had prohibited visiting families before the meal, Upananda visited them after the meal instead. As a consequence, he returned late to the monastery, and the food had to be returned to the donors. 

The\marginnote{2.12} monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda, “How can Venerable Upananda visit families after the meal?” … “Is it true, Upananda, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{2.15} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{2.16} Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Second preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk who has been invited to a meal visits families beforehand or afterwards, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{2.21} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Third sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{3.1} afterwards it was the robe-giving season. But being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not visit families. As a result, they only got a small amount of robe-cloth. They told the Buddha. … 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to visit families during the robe-giving season. }

And\marginnote{3.5} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Third preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk who has been invited to a meal visits families beforehand or afterwards, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession. This is the appropriate occasion: it is the robe-giving season.’” }

In\marginnote{3.8} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Fourth sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{4.1} afterwards the monks were making robes, and they needed a needle, thread, and scissors. But being afraid of wrongdoing, they did not visit families. They told the Buddha. … 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to visit families at a time of making robes. }

And\marginnote{4.5} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Fourth preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk who has been invited to a meal visits families beforehand or afterwards, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession. These are the appropriate occasions: it is the robe-giving season; it is a time of making robes.’” }

In\marginnote{4.8} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Fifth sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{5.1} afterwards there were sick monks who needed medicines. But being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not visit families. They told the Buddha. … 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to visit families after informing an available monk. }

And\marginnote{5.5} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk who has been invited to a meal visits families beforehand or afterwards without informing an available monk, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession.

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country in the Banyan Tree Monastery at Kapilavatthu, \textsanskrit{Mahānāma} the Sakyan had an abundance of tonics.\footnote{“Tonics” renders \textit{bhesajja}. In the origin story below \textit{bhesajja} seems to refer to the five standard tonics, and I translate it accordingly. The commentary at Sp 2.306 glosses \textit{bhesajja} with \textit{\textsanskrit{sappitelādīsu}}, “Ghee, oil, etc.”, which lends some support to this view. In the actual rule, however, the word \textit{paccaya} is used, which suggests a broader meaning. See comment to the actual rule below. } He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said, “Sir, I wish to invite the Sangha to ask for tonics for four months.” 

“Good,\marginnote{1.1.5} good, \textsanskrit{Mahānāma}. Please do so.” 

But\marginnote{1.1.7} the monks were afraid of wrongdoing and did not accept. They then told the Buddha what had happened. … 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to accept an invitation to ask for tonics for four months.” }

Yet\marginnote{1.2.1} the monks only asked \textsanskrit{Mahānāma} for a small amount of tonics, and so he still had an abundance. A second time he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said, “Sir, I wish to invite the Sangha to ask for tonics for a further four months.” 

“Good,\marginnote{1.2.4} good, \textsanskrit{Mahānāma}. Please do so.” 

Again\marginnote{1.2.6} the monks were afraid of wrongdoing and did not accept. They told the Buddha. … 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to accept a further invitation.” }

Once\marginnote{1.3.1} again the monks only asked \textsanskrit{Mahānāma} for a small amount of tonics, and so he still had an abundance. A third time he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said, “Sir, I wish to invite the Sangha to ask for tonics for life.” 

“Good,\marginnote{1.3.4} good, \textsanskrit{Mahānāma}. Please do so.” 

Yet\marginnote{1.3.6} again the monks were afraid of wrongdoing and did not accept. They told the Buddha. … 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to accept a permanent invitation.” }

At\marginnote{1.4.1} that time the monks from the group of six were shabbily dressed and improper in appearance. \textsanskrit{Mahānāma} criticized them, “Venerables, why are you shabbily dressed and improper in appearance? Shouldn’t one who has gone forth be suitably dressed and proper in appearance?” 

The\marginnote{1.4.4} monks from the group of six developed a grudge against \textsanskrit{Mahānāma}. Thinking of ways to humiliate him, it occurred to them, “\textsanskrit{Mahānāma} has invited the Sangha to ask for tonics. Let’s ask him for ghee.” 

They\marginnote{1.4.7} then went to \textsanskrit{Mahānāma} and said, “We need a \textit{\textsanskrit{doṇa}} measure of ghee.”\footnote{According T. W.

“Please\marginnote{1.4.8} wait until tomorrow. People have gone to the cow-pen to get ghee. You may come and get it in the morning.” 

A\marginnote{1.4.11} second time and a third time the monks from the group of six said the same thing, and \textsanskrit{Mahānāma} replied as before. They then said, “Why do you give an invitation if you don’t wish to give?” 

\textsanskrit{Mahānāma}\marginnote{1.4.17} complained and criticized them, “How can they not wait for one day when asked?” 

The\marginnote{1.4.18} monks heard the complaints of \textsanskrit{Mahānāma}, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How could the monks from the group of six not wait for one day when asked by \textsanskrit{Mahānāma}?” … “Is it true, monks, that you acted like this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.4.22} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.4.23} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how could you act like this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘A monk who is not sick may accept an invitation to ask for requisites for four months. If he accepts one beyond that limit, except if it is a further invitation or a permanent invitation, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”\footnote{I render \textit{paccaya} as “requisites”, not as “tonics”. It might seem from the origin story and the word commentary below that this rule deals with tonics or medicines, \textit{bhesajja}. The problem with this view, however, is that \textit{paccaya}, when used alone, never has this meaning in the Vinaya, nor in the four main \textsanskrit{Nikāyas}. When \textit{paccaya} is used by itself, it invariably means cause, condition, foundation, support, or something to this effect. It only refers to medicines in compounds such as \textit{\textsanskrit{gilāna}-ppaccaya-bhesajja-\textsanskrit{parikkhāra}}, “medicines and requisites to \textit{support} the sick”, where it is the context that gives it its specific reference. In the present rule there is no such context. The meaning of the word remains “support”. Given that the rules must have existed before the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga}, the meaning of the rule is independent of it. We can only conclude that the meaning of \textit{paccaya} must be “support”, that is, any material requisite that supports the monastic life. See \href{https://suttacentral.net/an4.79/en/brahmali\#2.1}{AN 4.79} for the use of \textit{paccaya} in this sense. } }

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

On\marginnote{1.1} one occasion when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, King Pasenadi of Kosala was marching out with the army, and the monks from the group of six went to see it. When King Pasenadi saw the monks coming, he summoned them and said, “Venerables, why have you come here?” 

“We\marginnote{1.7} wish to see the great king.” 

“What’s\marginnote{1.8} the use of seeing me finding pleasure in battle? Shouldn’t you see the Buddha?” 

And\marginnote{1.10} people complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan monastics go to see the army? It’s our misfortune that we must go out with the army for the sake of our livelihoods and because of our wives and children.” 

The\marginnote{1.13} monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How could the monks from the group of six go to see the army?” … “Is it true, monks, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.17} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.18} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk goes to see an army, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.23} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards a certain monk had a sick uncle in the army. The uncle sent a message to that monk: “I’m with the army and I’m sick. Please come, venerable. I want you to come.” 

Knowing\marginnote{2.6} that the Buddha had laid down a rule against going to see an army, that monk thought, “I have a sick uncle in the army. What should I do now?” And he told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to go to the army when there’s a suitable reason. }

And\marginnote{2.12} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk goes to see an army, except if there is a suitable reason, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”\footnote{“Army” renders \textit{uyyutta sena}, which might be rendered “a mobilized army”. At the time of the Buddha it seems armies consisted entirely of reserve troops that would then be mobilized at times of war. With the advent of professional armies, however, armies are always more or less mobilized. Thus my rendering. } }

\subsection*{Origin story }

On\marginnote{1.1} one occasion when the Buddha was wandering in the country of Ceti on his way to \textsanskrit{Bhaddavatikā}, he was seen by a number of cowherds, shepherds, farmers, and travelers.\footnote{This a standard group of people also found at \href{https://suttacentral.net/mn50/en/brahmali\#10.3}{MN 50} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/mn86/en/brahmali\#3.3}{MN 86}. } They said to him, “Sir, don’t go to Ambatittha. There’s a highly venomous dragon with supernormal powers there, in the hermitage of a dreadlocked ascetic. Don’t let it harm you.” The Buddha was silent. They repeated their request a second and a third time, and the Buddha remained silent. 

The\marginnote{1.13} Buddha then continued on to \textsanskrit{Bhaddavatikā}, and he stayed there. 

Just\marginnote{1.14} then Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāgata} went to the hermitage of that dreadlocked ascetic and entered his fire hut. After preparing a spread of grass, he sat down, crossed his legs, straightened his body, and established mindfulness in front of him. Seeing that \textsanskrit{Sāgata} had entered the fire hut, the dragon was upset and emitted smoke. \textsanskrit{Sāgata}, too, emitted smoke. The dragon was not able to contain his rage and emitted flames. \textsanskrit{Sāgata} entered the fire element and he, too, emitted flames. Then, after conquering fire with fire, \textsanskrit{Sāgata} went to \textsanskrit{Bhaddavatikā}. 

After\marginnote{1.20} staying at \textsanskrit{Bhaddavatikā} for as long as he liked, the Buddha set out wandering toward \textsanskrit{Kosambī}. 

When\marginnote{1.22} he arrived, the lay followers there received him. 

But\marginnote{1.23} the lay followers at \textsanskrit{Kosambī} had heard about \textsanskrit{Sāgata} fighting the Ambatittha dragon. And so after receiving the Buddha, they went to see \textsanskrit{Sāgata}. They bowed, stood to one side, and said, “Venerable, what can we prepare for you that’s delicious but hard to get?” 

The\marginnote{1.25} monks from the group of six replied, “There’s a delicious liquor called \textsanskrit{Kāpotikā}, which is hard for the monks to get. Prepare that.” 

And\marginnote{1.26} the lay followers prepared \textsanskrit{Kāpotikā} in house after house. Then, when they saw that \textsanskrit{Sāgata} had entered the town for alms, they said to him, “Drink, venerable, drink the \textsanskrit{Kāpotikā} liquor.” \textsanskrit{Sāgata} drank that liquor in house after house, and as he was leaving town, he collapsed at the town gate. 

Just\marginnote{1.28} then the Buddha, together with a number of monks, was also leaving town, and he saw \textsanskrit{Sāgata} at the town gate. He said, “Monks, pick up \textsanskrit{Sāgata}.” Saying, “Yes, sir,” they led him to the monastery, where they put him down with his head toward the Buddha. But \textsanskrit{Sāgata} turned around, pointing his feet toward the Buddha. 

The\marginnote{1.32} Buddha said, “Previously, monks, wasn’t \textsanskrit{Sāgata} respectful and deferential toward me?” 

“Yes.”\marginnote{1.33} 

“But\marginnote{1.34} is he now?” 

“Certainly\marginnote{1.35} not.” 

“Just\marginnote{1.36} recently, didn’t \textsanskrit{Sāgata} fight the Ambatittha dragon?” 

“Yes.”\marginnote{1.37} 

“Would\marginnote{1.38} he now be able to fight a dragon?” 

“Certainly\marginnote{1.39} not.” 

“So,\marginnote{1.40} monks, should one drink that which makes one senseless?” 

“Certainly\marginnote{1.41} not, sir.” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.42} not suitable, monks, it’s not proper for \textsanskrit{Sāgata}, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could \textsanskrit{Sāgata} drink alcoholic drinks? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

On\marginnote{1.1} one occasion when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, the monks from the group of seventeen were playing in the water of the river \textsanskrit{Aciravatī}. Just then, while King Pasenadi of Kosala was up in his finest stilt house with Queen \textsanskrit{Mallikā}, he saw the monks from the group of seventeen playing in the river. He said to Queen \textsanskrit{Mallikā}, “\textsanskrit{Mallikā}, these perfected ones are playing in the water.” 

“Great\marginnote{1.7} king, no doubt the Buddha hasn’t laid down a rule. Either that, or these monks are ignorant.” 

King\marginnote{1.9} Pasenadi thought, “How can the Buddha find out about these monks playing in the water without me telling him?” 

Having\marginnote{1.11} sent for those monks, King Pasenadi gave them a large lump of sugar, saying, “Sirs, please give this lump of sugar to the Buddha.” 

The\marginnote{1.13} monks took the lump of sugar, went to the Buddha, and said, “Sir, this lump of sugar is a gift from King Pasenadi.” 

“But,\marginnote{1.16} monks, where did you see the king?” 

“From\marginnote{1.17} the river \textsanskrit{Aciravatī}, while playing in the water.” 

The\marginnote{1.18} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you play in water? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1.1} one time the Buddha was staying in the Bhagga country at \textsanskrit{Susumāragira} in the \textsanskrit{Bhesakaḷā} Grove, the deer park. At that time, during winter, the monks were warming themselves after setting fire to a hollow log. Heated by the fire, a black snake came out of the log and attacked the monks. The monks ran here and there. 

The\marginnote{1.1.5} monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How could those monks light a fire to warm themselves?” … “Is it true, monks, that monks did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.1.8} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.1.9} Buddha rebuked them … “How could those foolish men do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{First preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk lights a fire to warm himself, or has one lit, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.1.14} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.2.1} one time a number of monks were sick. The monks who were looking after them asked, “I hope you’re bearing up? I hope you’re getting better?” 

“Previously\marginnote{1.2.4} we lit a fire to warm ourselves, and then we were comfortable. But now that the Buddha has prohibited this, we don’t warm ourselves because we’re afraid of wrongdoing. Because of that we’re not comfortable.” 

They\marginnote{1.2.7} told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow a sick monk to light a fire to warm himself, or to have one lit. }

And\marginnote{1.2.9} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Second preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk who is not sick lights a fire to warm himself, or has one lit, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.2.11} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks.

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards the monks did not light lamps, small fires, or saunas because they were afraid of wrongdoing.\footnote{Sp 2.352: \textit{\textsanskrit{Jotikepīti} \textsanskrit{pattapacanasedakammādīsu} \textsanskrit{jotikaraṇe}}, “\textit{Jotikepi}: making a fire to fire a bowl, to make sweat, etc.” } They told the Buddha …

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} in the Bamboo Grove, the monks were bathing in the hot springs. Just then King Seniya \textsanskrit{Bimbisāra} of Magadha went to the hot springs, intending to wash his hair. He waited respectfully for the monks to finish, but they kept on bathing until dark. Only then was King \textsanskrit{Bimbisāra} able to wash his hair. And because the town gates had been shut, he had to spend the night outside the city.\footnote{\textit{Asambhinnena vilepanena} is an unusual expression. Sp-\textsanskrit{ṭ} 2.357: \textit{\textsanskrit{Asambhinnenāti} amakkhitena, \textsanskrit{anaṭṭhenāti} attho}, “\textit{Asambhinnena}: the meaning is ‘with (make-up) not smeared, not lost’.” } 

In\marginnote{1.6} the morning, with his make-up still on, he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. The Buddha said to him, “Great king, why have you come so early in the morning, with your make-up still on?” The king told him what had happened. The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which the king got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 

Soon\marginnote{1.10} afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that monks bathed without moderation, even after seeing the king?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.12} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.13} Buddha rebuked them … “How could those foolish men act in this way? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{First preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk bathes at intervals of less than a half-month, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.18} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards, because they were afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not bathe when it was hot or when they had a fever, and they went to sleep covered in sweat. As a consequence, their robes and beds got dirty. They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, if it’s hot or you have a fever, I allow you to bathe at intervals of less than a half-month. }

And\marginnote{2.5} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Second preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk bathes at intervals of less than a half-month, except on an appropriate occasion, he commits an offense entailing confession. This is the appropriate occasion: it is the two-and-a-half-month period of summer and the fever season, comprising the last one-and-a-half months of summer and the first month of the rainy season.’” }

\subsubsection*{Fourth sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{4.1} afterwards the monks were doing building work, but because they were afraid of wrongdoing they did not bathe. As a consequence, they went to sleep covered in sweat, and their robes and beds got dirty. They told the Buddha. … 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to bathe at intervals of less than a half-month when you’re working. }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, a number of monks and wanderers were robbed while traveling from \textsanskrit{Sāketa} to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. The king’s men set out from \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} and caught the thieves and their loot. They then sent a message to the monks: “Venerables, please come and pick out your own robes.” But the monks did not recognize them. The people complained and criticized them, “How can they not recognize their own robes?” 

The\marginnote{1.8} monks heard the complaints of those people, and they told the Buddha. He had the Sangha gathered, gave a teaching on what is right and proper, and then addressed the monks: “Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons: for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad people, for the ease of good monks, for the restraint of the corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of the corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training. And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘When a monk gets a new robe, he should apply one of three kinds of stains: blue-green, mud-color, or dark brown. If a monk uses a new robe without applying any of the three kinds of stains, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, Venerable Upananda the Sakyan assigned the ownership of a robe to a monk who was his brother’s student.

The\marginnote{1.5} monks of few desires complained and criticized Upananda, “How could Venerable Upananda use a robe he had assigned to a monk, without that monk first relinquishing it?” … “Is it true, Upananda, that you did this?”

At that time the monks from the group of six were reopening a legal issue that they knew had been legitimately settled, saying, “The legal procedure hasn’t been done;” “It’s been done badly;” “It should be done again;” “It hasn’t been settled;” “It’s been badly settled;” “It should be settled again.”\footnote{The Pali appears as a single sentence enclosed in quotes. Yet it is hard to see how this could have been spoken in one go, since some of the constituent clauses are mutually contradictory. For instance, the same legal procedure cannot have been both not done and badly done. I therefore take it that the individual clauses were spoken at different times. This method of putting together a number of independent utterances into a single quote is in fact quite common in the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka}. In most such cases I separate out the individual quotes. } 

The\marginnote{1.4} monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can the monks from the group of six reopen a legal issue that they know has been legitimately settled?” … “Is it true, monks, that you’re doing this?”

“Do\marginnote{1.9} others who have committed this offense need to do the same?”

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. At that time in \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} there was a group of seventeen boys who were friends, with \textsanskrit{Upāli} as their leader. 

\textsanskrit{Upāli}’s\marginnote{1.4} parents considered, “How can we make sure that \textsanskrit{Upāli} is able to live happily without exhausting himself after we’ve passed away? He could become a clerk, but then his fingers will hurt. Or he could become an accountant, but then his chest will hurt. Or he could become a banker, but then his eyes will hurt. But these Sakyan monastics have pleasant habits and a happy life. They eat nice food and sleep in beds sheltered from the wind. If \textsanskrit{Upāli} goes forth with them, he’ll be able to live happily without exhausting himself after we’ve passed away.” 

\textsanskrit{Upāli}\marginnote{1.18} overheard this conversation between his parents. He then went to the other boys and said, “Come, let’s go forth with the Sakyan monastics.” 

“If\marginnote{1.21} you go forth, so will we.” 

The\marginnote{1.22} boys went each to his own parents and said, “Please allow me to go forth into homelessness.” Since the parents knew that the boys all had the same desire and good intention, they gave their approval. The boys then went to the monks and asked for the going forth. And the monks gave them the going forth and the full ordination. 

Soon\marginnote{1.28} afterwards they got up early in the morning and cried, “Give us congee, give us a meal, give us fresh food.” 

The\marginnote{1.30} monks said, “Wait until it gets light. If any of that becomes available then, you can have it. If not, you’ll eat after walking for alms.” 

But\marginnote{1.36} they carried on as before. And they defecated and urinated on the furniture. 

After\marginnote{1.39} rising early in the morning, the Buddha heard the sound of those boys. He asked Venerable Ānanda, who told him what was happening. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the monks give the full ordination to people they know are less than twenty years old?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.45} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.46} Buddha rebuked them … “How can those foolish men do this? A person who is less than twenty years old is unable to endure cold and heat; hunger and thirst; horseflies, mosquitoes, wind, and the burning sun; creeping animals and insects; and rude and unwelcome speech. And they are unable to bear up with bodily feelings that are painful, severe, sharp, and destructive of life.\footnote{Sp-\textsanskrit{ṭ} 4.295: \textit{\textsanskrit{Sarīsapeti} ye keci sarante gacchante \textsanskrit{dīghajātike}}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Sarīsape}}: whatever long creatures are moving by flowing.” } But a person who’s twenty is able to endure these things. This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

If,\marginnote{2.1.9} intending to give the full ordination, he searches for a group, a teacher, a bowl, or a robe, or he establishes a monastery zone, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.\footnote{“Monastery zone” renders \textit{\textsanskrit{sīmā}}.  See Appendix of Technical Terms for discussion. } After the motion, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.\footnote{The Pali just says \textit{\textsanskrit{dukkaṭa}}, without specifying that it is an \textit{\textsanskrit{āpatti}}, “an offense”.

The implication is that in these contexts \textit{\textsanskrit{dukkaṭa}} should be read as \textit{\textsanskrit{āpatti} \textsanskrit{dukkaṭassa}}, “an offense of wrong conduct”. } After each of the first two announcements, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. When the last announcement is finished, the preceptor commits an offense entailing confession, while the group and the teacher commit an offense of wrong conduct.

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, a certain group of travelers was about to go south from \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}. A monk said to those people, “Let me travel with you.” 

“But\marginnote{1.5} we’re smuggling goods.” 

“That’s\marginnote{1.6} your business.”\footnote{\textit{\textsanskrit{Pajānāth}’\textsanskrit{āvuso}}, literally, “You know, friends.” According to the commentary to DN-a 2.436: \textit{\textsanskrit{Tvaṁ} \textsanskrit{pajānāhīti} \textsanskrit{tvaṁ} \textsanskrit{jāna}. Sace \textsanskrit{gaṇhitukāmosi}, \textsanskrit{gaṇhāhīti} \textsanskrit{vuttaṁ} hoti}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Tvaṁ} \textsanskrit{pajānāhi}}: you know. If you wish to take it, please do: this is what is meant.” In other words, it’s up to you to do what you like. } 

The\marginnote{1.7} customs officers heard about that group of travelers. They then blocked the road, caught the group, confiscated the goods, and asked that monk, “Venerable, why are you knowingly traveling with a group of thieves?” And they detained him. 

After\marginnote{1.13} being released, that monk went to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}, where he told the monks what had happened. The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How could a monk knowingly travel by arrangement with a group of thieves?” … “Is it true, monk, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.17} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.18} Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, a monk who was traveling through the Kosalan country on his way to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} walked through the gateway of a certain village. A woman who had had an argument with her husband walked through the same gateway. When she saw that monk, she asked him, “Venerable, where are you going?” 

“I’m\marginnote{1.5} going to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}.” 

“May\marginnote{1.6} I go with you?” 

“Sure.”\marginnote{1.7} 

Soon\marginnote{1.8} afterwards that woman’s husband also left that village. He asked around, “Have you seen such-and-such a woman?” 

“She’s\marginnote{1.10} walking along with a monastic.” 

He\marginnote{1.11} then followed after them, caught that monk, and gave him a beating. The monk sat down fuming at the foot of a tree. And the woman said to her husband, “This monk didn’t make me go; I was the one who went with him. He’s innocent. Go and ask his forgiveness.” And he did so. 

That\marginnote{1.19} monk then went to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} where he told the monks what had happened. The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How could a monk travel by arrangement with a woman?” … “Is it true, monk, that you did this?”

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time the monk \textsanskrit{Ariṭṭha}, an ex-vulture-killer, had the following bad and erroneous view: “As I understand the Teaching of the Buddha, the things he calls obstacles are unable to obstruct one who indulges in them.” 

A\marginnote{1.4} number of monks heard that \textsanskrit{Ariṭṭha} had that view. They went to him and asked, “Is it true, \textsanskrit{Ariṭṭha}, that you have such a view?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.11} indeed. As I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, the things he calls obstacles are unable to obstruct one who indulges in them.” 

“No,\marginnote{1.12} \textsanskrit{Ariṭṭha}, don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for it’s not good to misrepresent him. The Buddha would never say such a thing. The Buddha has given many discourses about the obstacles being obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them. The Buddha has said that the enjoyment provided by worldly pleasures is small, whereas the suffering and trouble with them are huge, and so their drawbacks are greater. The Buddha has said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeleton … similar to a piece of meat … similar to a grass torch … similar to a pit of coals … similar to a dream … similar to borrowed goods … similar to fruits on a tree … similar to a knife and chopping block … similar to swords and stakes … similar to a snake’s head; the suffering and trouble with them are huge, and so their drawbacks are greater.” 

But\marginnote{1.25} even though the monks corrected \textsanskrit{Ariṭṭha} like this, he stubbornly held on to that bad and erroneous view, and continued to insist on it. Since they were unable to make him give up that view, they went to the Buddha and told him what had happened. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned \textsanskrit{Ariṭṭha}: “Is it true, \textsanskrit{Ariṭṭha}, that you have such a view?” 

“Yes\marginnote{1.31} indeed, sir.” 

“Foolish\marginnote{1.32} man, who do you think I have taught like this? Haven’t I given many discourses about the obstacles being obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them? I have said that the enjoyment provided by worldly pleasures is small, whereas the suffering and trouble with them are huge, and so their drawbacks are greater. I have said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeleton … similar to a piece of meat … similar to a grass torch … similar to a pit of coals … similar to a dream … similar to borrowed goods … similar to fruits on a tree … similar to a knife and chopping block … similar to swords and stakes … similar to a snake’s head; the suffering and trouble with them are huge, and so their drawbacks are greater. And yet, foolish man, by misunderstanding you have misrepresented me, hurt yourself, and made much demerit. This will be for your long-lasting harm and suffering. 

This\marginnote{1.47} will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\scrule{‘If a monk says,  “As I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, the things he calls obstacles are unable to obstruct one who indulges in them,”  then the monks should correct him like this:  “No, venerable, don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for it’s not good to misrepresent the Buddha. The Buddha would never say such a thing.  In many discourses the Buddha has declared the obstacles to be obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them.” If that monk continues as before, the monks should press him up to three times to make him give up that view. If he then gives it up, all is well.  If he does not, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time the novice monastic \textsanskrit{Kaṇṭaka} had the following bad and erroneous view: “As I understand the teachings of the Buddha, the things he calls obstacles are unable to obstruct one who indulges in them.” 

A\marginnote{1.4} number of monks heard that the novice monastic \textsanskrit{Kaṇṭaka} had that view. They went to see him and asked, “Is it true, \textsanskrit{Kaṇṭaka}, that you have such a view?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.9} indeed. As I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, the things he calls obstacles are unable to obstruct one who indulges in them.” 

“No,\marginnote{1.10} \textsanskrit{Kaṇṭaka}, don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for it’s not good to misrepresent him. The Buddha would never say such a thing. The Buddha has given many discourses about the obstacles being obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them. The Buddha has said that the enjoyment provided by worldly pleasures is small, whereas the suffering and trouble with them are huge, and so their drawbacks are greater. …” But even though the monks corrected \textsanskrit{Kaṇṭaka} like this, he stubbornly held on to that bad and erroneous view, and he continued to insist on it. 

Since\marginnote{1.15} those monks were unable to make him give up that view, they went to the Buddha and told him what had happened. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the \textsanskrit{Kaṇṭaka}: “Is it true, \textsanskrit{Kaṇṭaka}, that you have such a view?” 

“Yes\marginnote{1.19} indeed, venerable sir.” 

“Foolish\marginnote{1.20} man, who do you think I have taught like this? Haven’t I given many discourses about the obstacles being obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them? I have said that the enjoyment provided by worldly pleasures is small, whereas the suffering and trouble with them are huge, and so their drawbacks are greater. I have said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeleton … similar to a snake’s head; the suffering and trouble with them are huge, and so their drawbacks are greater. And yet, foolish man, by misunderstanding you have misrepresented me, hurt yourself, and made much demerit. This will be for your long-lasting harm and suffering. 

This\marginnote{1.27} will affect people’s confidence, and cause some to lose it.” 

Having\marginnote{1.29} rebuked him … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Well then, monks, the Sangha should expel the novice monastic \textsanskrit{Kaṇṭaka}. And this is how he should be expelled: ‘From today, \textsanskrit{Kaṇṭaka}, you may not refer to the Buddha as your teacher. And, unlike other novices, you can no longer share a sleeping place with the monks for two or three nights. Go! Away with you!’” The Sangha then expelled \textsanskrit{Kaṇṭaka}. 

Soon\marginnote{1.37} afterwards the monks from the group of six befriended \textsanskrit{Kaṇṭaka}, and they were attended on by him, lived with him, and shared a sleeping place with him. Yet they knew that he had been expelled. The monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How can the monks from the group of six befriend \textsanskrit{Kaṇṭaka}, and be attended on by him, live with him, and share a sleeping place with him, even though they know that he has been expelled?” … “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.41} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.42} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

“It’s\marginnote{1.9} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.10} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how could you say this during the recitation of the Monastic Code? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} in the Bamboo Grove, Venerable Dabba the Mallian, who was the assigner of dwellings and the designator of meals, had a robe that was worn out. Just then the Sangha had obtained a robe, which it gave to Dabba. The monks from the group of six complained and criticized it, “The monks are diverting the Sangha’s material things according to friendship.” 

The\marginnote{1.8} monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How could the monks from the group of six give out a robe as part of a unanimous Sangha and then criticize it afterwards?” … “Is it true, monks, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.11} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.12} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, an association had prepared a meal together with robe-cloth for the Sangha. They said, “After giving the food, we’ll offer the robe-cloth.” 

But\marginnote{1.4} the monks from the group of six went to that association and said, “Please give the robe-cloth to these monks.” 

“Venerables,\marginnote{1.7} we can’t do that. We’ve prepared our annual alms-offering together with robe-cloth for the Sangha.” 

“The\marginnote{1.9} Sangha has many donors and supporters. But since these monks are staying here, they are looking to you for support. If you don’t give to them, who will? So give them the robe-cloth.” Being pressured by the monks from the group of six, that association gave the prepared robe-cloth to those monks and served the food to the Sangha. 

The\marginnote{1.14} monks who knew that a meal together with robe-cloth had been prepared for the Sangha, but not that the robe-cloth had been given to those monks from the group of six, said, “You may offer the robe-cloth.” 

“There\marginnote{1.16} isn’t any. The robe-cloth we had prepared was diverted by the monks from the group of six.” 

The\marginnote{1.18} monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How could the monks from the group of six divert to an individual things they knew were intended for the Sangha?” … “Is it true, monks, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.21} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.22} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, King Pasenadi of Kosala told his park-keeper, “Go and clean up the park; I’ll be going there.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.1.3} sir.” While cleaning the park, he saw the Buddha seated at the foot of a tree. He then went to King Pasenadi and said, “The park is clean, sir, but the Buddha is sitting there.” “Marvelous! I’ll visit him.” 

The\marginnote{1.1.6} king went to the park and approached the Buddha, but just then a lay follower was seated there. When the king saw him, he became fearful and stopped. But he considered, “This man isn’t likely to be bad, since he’s visiting the Buddha,” and so he approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. But when that lay follower, because of his respect for the Buddha, neither bowed down to the king nor stood up for him, the king became annoyed. The Buddha realized what was happening and said to the king, “Great king, this lay follower is learned, a master of the tradition, and he’s free from sensual desire.” 

The\marginnote{1.1.11} king thought, “This lay follower doesn’t deserve to be in an inferior position, since even the Buddha praises him.” And he said to that lay follower, “Please say what you want.” 

“Thank\marginnote{1.1.13} you, sir.”\footnote{\textit{\textsanskrit{Suṭṭhu}, \textsanskrit{devāti}}, literally, “It is good, sir.” The exact contextual meaning is not clear to me. } 

The\marginnote{1.1.14} Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened King Pasenadi with a teaching, after which the king got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. 

Soon\marginnote{1.1.15} afterwards King Pasenadi was up in his finest stilt house, when he saw that lay follower walking along the street, holding a sunshade. He summoned him and said, “You are a learned Buddhist, a master of the tradition. Please teach my harem.” 

“Whatever\marginnote{1.1.18} I know, sir, I know because of the monks. They should teach the harem.” 

Knowing\marginnote{1.2.1} that the lay follower was right, the king went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said, “Sir, please ask a monk to teach my harem.” The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened King Pasenadi with a teaching, after which the king got up from his seat, paid his respects as before, and left. 

Soon\marginnote{1.2.4} afterwards, the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda, “Well then, Ānanda, teach the king’s harem.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.2.5} sir.” And from time to time he would enter the harem and teach. 

Then,\marginnote{1.2.6} after robing up in the morning, Ānanda took his bowl and robe and went to King Pasenadi’s house. 

On\marginnote{1.2.7} that occasion the king was in bed with Queen \textsanskrit{Mallikā}. The queen saw Ānanda coming and she quickly got up, but her burnished golden dressing gown fell off. Ānanda turned around right there and returned to the monastery. And he told the monks what had happened. 

The\marginnote{1.2.10} monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How could Venerable Ānanda enter the royal compound without first being announced?” … “Is it true, Ānanda, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.2.13} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.2.14} Buddha rebuked him … “Ānanda, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … Having rebuked him … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

“Monks,\marginnote{1.3.1} there are these ten dangers of entering a royal compound.\footnote{For the rendering of \textit{antepura} as “royal compound”, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } What ten? 

It\marginnote{1.3.3} may be that a monk enters where the king is sitting with his queen. The queen smiles when she sees the monk or the monk smiles when he sees the queen. The king thinks, ‘Surely they’ve done it, or they’re going to.’ 

Again,\marginnote{1.3.9} because the king is very busy, he does not remember having slept with a certain woman, yet she becomes pregnant because of that. The king thinks, ‘Only the monk enters here. Is he responsible for this?’ 

Again,\marginnote{1.3.16} a gem disappears from the royal compound. The king thinks, ‘Only the monk enters here. Is he responsible for this?’ 

Again,\marginnote{1.3.21} secret discussions in the royal compound are spread outside. The king thinks, ‘Only the monk enters here. Is he responsible for this?’ 

Again,\marginnote{1.3.26} in the royal compound a father longs for his son, or a son longs for his father.\footnote{This may refer to illegitimate offspring, and the monk acting as an informant. } They think, ‘Only the monk enters here. Is he responsible for this?’ 

Again,\marginnote{1.3.31} the king promotes someone. Those who dislike this think, ‘The king is close to the monk. Is he responsible for this?’ 

Again,\marginnote{1.3.36} the king demotes someone. Those who dislike this think, ‘The king is close to the monk. Is he responsible for this?’ 

Again,\marginnote{1.3.41} the king sends out the army at an inappropriate time. Those who dislike this think, ‘The king is close to the monk. Is he responsible for this?’ 

Again,\marginnote{1.3.46} after sending out the army at an appropriate time, the king orders it to turn back while still en route. Those who dislike this think, ‘The king is close to the monk. Is he responsible for this?’ 

Again,\marginnote{1.3.51} a royal compound is crowded with elephants, horses, and chariots, as well as enticing sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and tangibles that are not suitable for a monk. 

Monks,\marginnote{1.3.53} these are the ten dangers of entering a royal compound.” 

Then,\marginnote{1.3.54} after rebuking Ānanda in many ways, the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk, without first being announced, crosses the threshold to the bedroom of a consecrated aristocrat king, when both the king and the queen are present, he commits an offense entailing confession.’”\footnote{The Pali just says threshold: “The threshold of a consecrated king”.

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, a monk was bathing in the river \textsanskrit{Aciravatī}, when a brahmin, too, came there to bathe. He deposited a bag with five hundred coins on the ground, bathed, forgot about the bag, and left. The monk thought, “This is the bag belonging to that brahmin; it wouldn’t be nice if it got lost,” and he picked it up. 

Soon\marginnote{1.4} the brahmin remembered. He hurried back and asked that monk, “Sir, did you see my bag?” 

Saying,\marginnote{1.5} “I did indeed,” he gave it to him. 

The\marginnote{1.6} brahmin thought, “How can I avoid giving a reward to this monk?” And he said, “I didn’t have five hundred coins, I had a thousand!” And he seized hold of that monk. 

After\marginnote{1.8} being released, that monk went to the monastery and told the monks what had happened. The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How could a monk pick up precious things?” … “Is it true, monk, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.12} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.13} Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{First preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk picks up something precious or something regarded as precious, or he has it picked up, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.18} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards there was a celebration in \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. People were going to the park all dressed up, as did \textsanskrit{Visākhā} \textsanskrit{Migāramātā}. As she was leaving her village, she thought, “What will I do when I get to the park? Why don’t I pay a visit to the Buddha!” She then removed all her ornaments, bound them in a bundle with her upper robe, and gave it to her slave girl, saying, “Listen, look after this bundle.” 

\textsanskrit{Visākhā}\marginnote{2.5} then went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. And the Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching, after which she got up from her seat, bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left. And the slave girl left too, forgetting the bundle. 

The\marginnote{2.8} monks saw it and told the Buddha. “Well then, monks, pick it up and put it aside.” Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Within a monastery, monks, you should pick up precious things or what’s regarded as precious, or have it picked up, and then put it aside with the thought, ‘Whoever owns it will come and get it.’ And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Second preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk picks up something precious or something regarded as precious, or he has it picked up, except within a monastery, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{2.13} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Third sub-story }

At\marginnote{3.1} that time the householder \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika} had a whole village working for him in the country of \textsanskrit{Kāsi}, and he had told an apprentice there that if the monks arrive he should make them a meal. Soon afterwards a number of monks were wandering in the country of \textsanskrit{Kāsi}, when they came to that village. When that man saw them coming, he approached them, bowed, and said, “Venerables, please accept a meal from \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika} tomorrow.” The monks accepted by remaining silent. 

The\marginnote{3.6} following morning, after having various kinds of fine foods prepared, he had the monks informed that it was time for the meal. He removed a ring from his finger and then offered the food to the monks, saying, “Venerables, please leave after you’ve eaten. I have to go to work.” And he left, forgetting his ring. 

The\marginnote{3.8} monks saw it and said, “If we just go, this ring will be lost,” and so they stayed right there. When that man returned from work, he saw the monks and said to them, “Why are you still here?” And the monks told him what had happened. 

Those\marginnote{3.11} monks then went to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} where they told the monks, who in turn told the Buddha. 

After\marginnote{3.13} giving a teaching, the Buddha addressed the monks: “Within a monastery, monks, or inside a lodging, you should pick up precious things or what’s regarded as precious, or have it picked up, and then put it aside with the thought, ‘Whoever owns it will come and get it.’ And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk picks up something precious or something regarded as precious, or he has it picked up, except within a monastery or inside a lodging, he commits an offense entailing confession. If he picks up something precious or something regarded as precious, or he has it picked up, within a monastery or inside a lodging, he should put it aside with the thought, “Whoever owns it will come and get it.” This is the proper procedure.’” }

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time the monks from the group of six entered the village at the wrong time, sat down in the public meeting hall, and talked about all sorts of worldly things: about kings, gangsters, and officials; about armies, dangers, and battles; about food, drink, clothes, and beds; about garlands and perfumes; about relatives, vehicles, villages, towns, and countries; about women and heroes; gossip; about the departed; about various trivialities; about the world and the sea; about the various kinds of existence. 

People\marginnote{1.4} complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan monastics enter the village at the wrong time, sit down in the public meeting hall, and talk about such worldly things? They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 

The\marginnote{1.8} monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How can the monks from the group of six do this?” … “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.16} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.17} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{First preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk enters an inhabited area at the wrong time, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.24} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards a number of monks were walking through the Kosalan country on their way to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}, when one evening they came to a certain village. People saw them and said, “Venerables, please enter the village.” But knowing that entering a village at the wrong time had been prohibited by the Buddha and being afraid of wrongdoing, they declined. And so thieves robbed them. 

They\marginnote{2.7} then went to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} and told the monks what had happened, who in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to enter an inhabited area at the wrong time after informing someone. }

And\marginnote{2.11} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Second preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk, without informing anyone, enters an inhabited area at the wrong time, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{2.13} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Third sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{3.1} afterwards a monk was walking through the Kosalan country on his way to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}, when one evening he came to a certain village. People saw him and said, “Venerable, please enter the village.” But knowing that entering a village at the wrong time without informing anyone had been prohibited by the Buddha and being afraid of wrongdoing, he declined. And so thieves robbed him. 

He\marginnote{3.7} then went to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} and told the monks what had happened, who in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to enter an inhabited area at the wrong time after informing an available monk. }

And\marginnote{3.11} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Third preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk, when a monk is available, enters an inhabited area at the wrong time without informing him, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{3.13} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Fourth sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{4.1} afterwards a monk was bitten by a snake. Another monk went to the village to get fire. He then remembered that the Buddha has prohibited entering a village at the wrong time without informing an available monk. And being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not enter.\footnote{The ellipses points are not found in the PTS version. In fact, the ellipses points do not fit, since they imply that the monk gets robbed (as above), which does not fit the context. I therefore follow the PTS punctuation. } They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to enter an inhabited area at the wrong time without informing an available monk if there is some appropriate urgent business. }

And\marginnote{4.8} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country in the Banyan Tree Monastery at Kapilavatthu. At that time an ivory-worker had invited the monks who needed needle cases to ask for one. And the monks asked for many needle cases. Those who had small needle cases asked for large ones, and those who had large needle cases asked for small ones. The ivory-worker was so busy making needle cases for the monks that he was unable to make goods for sale. He could not make a living for himself, and his wives and children suffered. People complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan monastics not have any sense of moderation and ask for many needle cases?

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, he allowed rainy-season robes for the monks. Knowing this, the monks from the group of six wore rainy-season robes that were inappropriate in size. As they were walking about, they were dragging them along, both in front and behind. 

The\marginnote{1.6} monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How can the monks from the group of six wear such rainy-season robes?” … “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.9} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.10} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk is having a rainy-season robe made, it should be made the right size. This is the right size: six standard handspans long and two-and-a-half wide.\footnote{For an explanation of rendering \textit{sugata} as “standard”, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } If it exceeds that, it is to be cut down, and he commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time there was a handsome and graceful monk called Venerable Nanda, the Buddha’s cousin. He was seven centimeters shorter than the Buddha,\footnote{That is, four fingerbreadths. For a discussion of the \textit{\textsanskrit{aṅgula}}, see \textit{sugata} in Appendix of Technical Terms. } but he wore a robe that was the same size as the Buddha’s.\footnote{Here I render \textit{sugata} as “Buddha”, which seems required by the narrative. I do not think, however, that this narrative usage ties our hands in the interpretation of this term. See below. } When the senior monks saw him coming, they thought it was the Buddha and got up from their seats. 

But\marginnote{1.7} when he came close, they realized who it was, and they complained and criticized him, “How can Venerable Nanda wear a robe the same size as the Buddha’s?” … “Is it true, Nanda, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.10} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.11} Buddha rebuked him … “Nanda, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

Venerables,\marginnote{0.5} these four rules on acknowledgment come up for recitation. 

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, a certain nun was returning from almsround in \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. She saw a monk and said to him, “Here, venerable, please take some almsfood.” 

Saying,\marginnote{1.4} “Alright, Sister,” he took everything. But because the time for eating was coming to an end, she was not able to go for alms, and she missed her meal. 

The\marginnote{1.6} next day and the following day the same thing happened again. On the fourth day that nun was walking along a street, trembling. A wealthy merchant coming by carriage in the opposite direction saw her and shouted out, “Watch out, venerable!” As she stepped aside, she collapsed right there. 

The\marginnote{1.15} merchant asked her for forgiveness: “Forgive me, venerable, since you fell because of me.” 

“I\marginnote{1.17} didn’t fall because of you, but because I’m weak.” 

“But\marginnote{1.19} why are you so weak?” 

The\marginnote{1.20} nun told him what had happened. He then brought her to his house and gave her a meal. Afterwards he complained and criticized the monks, “How can the venerables receive food directly from a nun? It’s difficult for women to get material support.” 

The\marginnote{1.24} monks heard the complaints of that merchant, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized that monk, “How could a monk receive food directly from a nun?” … “Is it true, monk, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.28} true, sir.” 

“Is\marginnote{1.29} she a relative of yours?” 

“No,\marginnote{1.30} sir.” 

“Foolish\marginnote{1.31} man, a man and a woman who are unrelated don’t know what’s appropriate and inappropriate, what’s good and bad, in dealing with each other. So how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a monk receives fresh or cooked food directly from an unrelated nun who has entered an inhabited area, and then eats it, he must acknowledge it: “I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’” }

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. At that time, when families invited monks to meals, the nuns from the group of six were directing people toward the monks from the group of six, saying, “Give curry here; give rice there.” The monks from the group of six ate as much as they wanted, but not so the other monks. 

The\marginnote{1.7} monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How could the monks from the group of six not restrain the nuns from giving directions?” … “Is it true, monks, that you didn’t do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.10} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.11} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how could you not do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time in \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} there was a family where both the husband and the wife had confidence. They were growing in faith, but declining in wealth. Whatever food they had in the morning, they gave to the monks. Sometimes they went without food. 

People\marginnote{1.4} complained and criticized the monks, “How can the Sakyan monastics not have a sense of moderation in receiving offerings? After giving to them, these people sometimes go without.” 

The\marginnote{1.7} monks heard the complaints of those people and they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, if a family’s faith is growing, but its wealth is declining, you should designate it as ‘in training’, through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and one announcement. }

And\marginnote{1.11} the designation should be given like this. A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: 

‘Please,\marginnote{1.13} venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. Such-and-such a family is growing in faith, but declining in wealth. If the Sangha is ready, it should designate that family as “in training”. This is the motion. 

Please,\marginnote{1.17} venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. Such-and-such a family is growing in faith, but declining in wealth. The Sangha designates that family as “in training”. Any monk who approves of designating that family as “in training” should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. 

The\marginnote{1.22} Sangha has designated such-and-such a family as “in training”. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’ 

“And,\marginnote{1.24} monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{First preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘There are families that are designated as “in training”. If a monk eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from such a family, he must acknowledge it: “I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’” }

In\marginnote{1.27} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards there was a celebration in \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} and people invited the monks for a meal. And so did the family that had been designated as in training. But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from such a family, and being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not accept. That family complained and criticized them, “What is it with us that they don’t receive from us?” 

The\marginnote{2.8} monks heard the complaints of those people and they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, if you have been invited, I allow you to eat fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from a family designated as in training. }

And\marginnote{2.12} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Second preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘There are families that are designated as “in training”. If a monk, without first being invited, eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from such a family, he must acknowledge it: “I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’” }

In\marginnote{2.15} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Third sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{3.1} afterwards a certain monk was associating with that family. One morning he robed up, took his bowl and robe, went to them, and sat down on the prepared seat. Just then that monk was sick, and so they invited him to eat. But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited an uninvited monk from eating fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from such a family, and being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not accept. And being unable to walk for alms, he missed his meal. 

He\marginnote{3.10} then returned to the monastery and told the monks what had happened, who in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow a sick monk to eat fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from a family designated as in training. }

And\marginnote{3.14} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘There are families that are designated as “in training”. If a monk, without being sick and without first being invited, eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from such a family, he must acknowledge it: “I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’” }

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country in the Banyan Tree Monastery at Kapilavatthu, the slaves of the Sakyans were rebelling. The Sakyan women wished to prepare a meal at the wilderness dwellings, but the slaves heard about this and besieged the path. When the Sakyan women took various kinds of fine foods and set out for a wilderness dwelling, the slaves emerged, and they robbed and raped those Sakyan women. Soon afterwards the Sakyan men came out, and they got hold of those criminals together with their loot. They then complained and criticized the monks, “How could they not inform us that there are criminals staying near the monastery?” 

The\marginnote{1.11} monks heard the complaints of the Sakyans and they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons: for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad people, for the ease of good monks, for the restraint of the corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of the corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training. And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\scrule{‘There are wilderness dwellings that are considered risky and dangerous. If a monk, without first making an announcement about those dwellings, eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it inside that monastery, he must acknowledge it: “I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’” }

In\marginnote{1.18} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards a monk in a wilderness dwelling was sick. People took fresh and cooked food and went to that wilderness dwelling, and they invited that monk to eat. But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited the eating of fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it at a wilderness dwelling, and being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not accept it. And being unable to walk for alms, he missed his meal. 

He\marginnote{2.7} then told the monks what had happened, and they in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow a sick monk, without first making an announcement, to eat fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it at a wilderness dwelling. }

And\marginnote{2.11} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘There are wilderness dwellings that are considered risky and dangerous. If a monk who is not sick, without first making an announcement about those dwellings, eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it inside that monastery, he must acknowledge it:\footnote{It is hard to make out from the Pali what the announcement is about. The crucial word \textit{\textsanskrit{appaṭisaṁviditaṁ}} can be read as an adjective qualifying \textit{\textsanskrit{khādanīyaṁ}} and \textit{\textsanskrit{bhojanīyaṁ}}, in which case it is the food that needs to be announced. Alternatively, it can be regarded as an independent sentence verb, in which case it would seem that it is the risky and dangerous nature of the dwellings that needs to be announced. The word commentary in part supports the former interpretation, whereas the origin story supports the latter. Given this uncertainty, I have opted to translate according to what seems to make the best sense. } “I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’” }

\subsection*{Definitions }

\begin{description}%
\item[There are wilderness dwellings: ] a wilderness dwelling: if it is at least 800 meters away from any inhabited area.\footnote{That is, 500 bow-lengths. For a discussion of the \textit{dhanu}, see \textit{sugata} in Appendix of Technical Terms. } %
\item[Risky: ] in the monastery, or in the vicinity of the monastery, criminals have been seen camping, eating, standing, sitting, or lying down. %
\item[Dangerous: ] in the monastery, or in the vicinity of the monastery, criminals have been seen injuring, robbing, or beating people. %
\item[A: ] whoever … %
\item[Monk: ] … The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case. %
\item[About those dwellings: ] about such kinds of dwellings. %
\item[Without making an announcement: ] if an announcement is made to any of one’s five co-monastics, this is called “without making an announcement”.\footnote{Sp 2.573: \textit{\textsanskrit{Pañcannaṁ} \textsanskrit{paṭisaṁviditanti} \textsanskrit{pañcasu} sahadhammikesu}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Pañcannaṁ} \textsanskrit{paṭisaṁviditaṁ}} means the five co-monastics.” That is, a monk, a nun, a trainee nun, a novice monk, or a novice nun. The point here is that the announcement needs to be made directly to the lay supporters to be valid. } If an announcement is made about anything apart from the monastery or its vicinity, this is called “without making an announcement”. %
\item[Making an announcement: ] if a woman or a man comes to the monastery or the vicinity of the monastery and says, “Venerable, people will be bringing so-and-so’s fresh or cooked food,” then, if it is risky, this should be declared, and if it is dangerous, that should be declared.\footnote{Presumably this refers to a servant or a messenger coming to the monastery to let the monks know of the forthcoming offering of food. The “people” would then be other servants bringing the food on behalf of the donor. } If the person says, “Never mind, it will be brought,” then the criminals are to be told, “People are coming here; go away.” When an announcement has been made in regard to congee, and accompanying food is brought, this is called “announced”. When an announcement has been made in regard to rice, and accompanying food is brought, this is called “announced”. When an announcement has been made in regard to fresh food, and accompanying food is brought, this is called “announced”. When an announcement has been made in regard to a particular family, then when any person from that family brings fresh or cooked food, this is called “announced”. When an announcement has been made in regard to a particular village, then when any person from that village brings fresh or cooked food, this is called “announced”. When an announcement has been made in regard to a particular association, then when any person from that association brings fresh or cooked food, this is called “announced”. %
\item[Fresh food: ] apart from the five cooked foods, the post-midday tonics, the seven-day tonics, and the lifetime tonics—the rest is called “fresh food”. %
\item[Cooked food: ] there are five kinds of cooked food: cooked grain, porridge, flour products, fish, and meat. %
\item[Inside that monastery: ] if the monastery is enclosed, then within the enclosure. If the monastery is unenclosed, then in the vicinity. %
\item[Who is not sick: ] who is able to walk for alms. %
\item[Who is sick: ] who is unable to walk for alms. %
\end{description}

If,\marginnote{3.1.36} without making an announcement, one who is not sick receives fresh or cooked food with the intention of eating it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. For every mouthful swallowed, he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment. 

\subsection*{Permutations }

If\marginnote{3.1.38.1} there has been no announcement, and he does not perceive that there has, and he, not being sick, eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it inside that monastery, then he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment. If there has been no announcement, but he is unsure of it, and he, not being sick, eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it inside that monastery, then he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment. If there has been no announcement, but he perceives that there has, and he, not being sick, eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it inside that monastery, then he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment. 

If\marginnote{3.1.41} he receives post-midday tonics, seven-day tonics, or lifetime tonics for the purpose of food, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. For every mouthful swallowed, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If there has been an announcement, but he does not perceive that there has, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If there has been an announcement, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If there has been an announcement, and he perceives that there has, there is no offense. 

\subsection*{Non-offenses }

There\marginnote{3.2.1} is no offense: if there has been an announcement;  if he is sick;  if he eats the leftovers from where there has been an announcement or from one who is sick;  if he receives the food outside the monastery and then eats it inside;  if he eats a root, bark, a leaf, a flower, or a fruit originating in that monastery;  if, when there is a reason, he uses post-midday tonics, seven-day tonics, or lifetime tonics;  if he is insane;  if he is the first offender. 

\scendsutta{The fourth training rule entailing acknowledgment is finished. }

“Venerables,\marginnote{3.2.11} the four rules on acknowledgment have been recited. In regard to this I ask you, ‘Are you pure in this?’ A second time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?’ A third time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?’ You are pure in this and therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.”

Venerables,\marginnote{0.6} these rules to be trained in come up for recitation. 

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, the monks from the group of six were wearing their sarongs hanging down in front and behind. People complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan monastics wear their sarongs hanging down in front and behind? They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 

The\marginnote{1.5} monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How can the monks from the group of six wear their sarongs hanging down in front and behind?” 

After\marginnote{1.8} rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks from the group of six: “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.11} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.12} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘“I will wear my sarong evenly all around,” this is how you should train.’” }

One\marginnote{1.17} should wear one’s sarong evenly all around, covering the navel and the knees. If a monk, out of disrespect, wears his sarong hanging down in front or behind, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time the monks from the group of six ate rice and bean curry that they had requested themselves. People complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan monastics eat rice and bean curry that they have requested themselves? Who doesn’t like nice food? Who doesn’t prefer tasty food?” 

The\marginnote{1.7} monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How can the monks from the group of six do this?” … “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.11} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.12} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘“I will not request bean curry or rice for myself and then eat it,” this is how you should train.’” }

In\marginnote{1.17} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards a number of monks were sick. The monks who were looking after them asked, “I hope you’re bearing up? I hope you’re getting better?” 

“Previously\marginnote{2.4} we ate rice and bean curry that we had requested ourselves, and then we were comfortable. But now that the Buddha has prohibited this, we don’t ask because we’re afraid of wrongdoing. And because of that we’re not comfortable.” 

They\marginnote{2.7} told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow a sick monk to eat rice and bean curry that he has requested for himself. }

And\marginnote{2.9} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘“When not sick, I will not request bean curry or rice for myself and then eat it,” this is how you should train.’” }

When\marginnote{2.11} one is not sick, one should not request bean curry or rice for oneself and then eat it. If a monk who is not sick, out of disrespect, eats bean curry or rice that he has requested for himself, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 

\subsection*{Non-offenses }

There\marginnote{2.13.1} is no offense: if it is unintentional;  if he is not mindful;  if he does not know;  if he is sick;  if it is from relatives;  if it is from those who have given an invitation;  if it is for the benefit of someone else;  if it is by means of his own property;  if there is an emergency;  if he is insane;  if he is the first offender.

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Kosambī} in Ghosita’s Monastery, a brahmin prepared a milk drink for the Sangha. The monks slurped while drinking the milk. A monk who was previously an entertainer made a joke of it, saying, “It’s as if the whole Sangha is cooled.”\footnote{This is a play on words in the Pali. The Pali word here translated as “cooled”, \textit{\textsanskrit{sītīkata}} (literally, “made cool”), is similar to \textit{\textsanskrit{sītibhūta}}, “become cool”, an epithet for \textit{arahants}, “perfected ones”. } 

The\marginnote{1.6} monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How could a monk joke about the Sangha?” … “Is it true, monk, that you did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.9} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.10} Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking him … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, you should not joke about the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Sangha. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” }

After\marginnote{1.17} rebuking that monk in many ways, the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying in the Bhagga country at \textsanskrit{Susumāragira} in the \textsanskrit{Bhesakaḷā} Grove, the monks from the group of six gave teachings to people holding a sunshade. 

The\marginnote{1.3} monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How can the monks from the group of six give teachings to people holding a sunshade?” … “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.6} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.7} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘“I will not give a teaching to anyone holding a sunshade,” this is how you should train.’” }

In\marginnote{1.12} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards, being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not give teachings to sick people holding a sunshade. People complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan monastics not give teachings to someone who’s sick holding a sunshade?” 

The\marginnote{2.4} monks heard the complaints of those people, and they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow you to give a teaching to someone who’s sick holding a sunshade. }

And\marginnote{2.8} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this:

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time the monks from the group of six were sitting on low seats while giving teachings to people sitting on high seats. 

The\marginnote{1.3} monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can the monks from the group of six sit on low seats while giving teachings to people sitting on high seats?” … “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.6} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.7} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\subparagraph*{Jataka }

“Once\marginnote{1.12.1} upon a time in \textsanskrit{Bārāṇasī}, monks, there was a low-caste man whose wife became pregnant. She said to him, ‘I’m pregnant. I crave mangoes.’ 

‘But\marginnote{1.16} there are no mangoes. It’s the wrong season.’ 

‘If\marginnote{1.17} I don’t get any, I’ll die.’ 

At\marginnote{1.18} that time the king had a mango tree that was always bearing fruit. Then that low-caste man went to that mango tree, climbed it, and hid himself. Just then the king and his brahmin counselor went to that same mango tree. There the king sat on a high seat while learning the Vedas. The low-caste man thought, ‘How wrong-headed this king is, sitting on a high seat while learning the Vedas. And the brahmin is wrong-headed too, sitting on a low seat while teaching the Vedas to one sitting on a high seat. And I’m wrong-headed too, stealing mangoes from the king because of a woman. This is all so low!’\footnote{Sp-\textsanskrit{ṭ} 2.647: \textit{\textsanskrit{Yaṁ} amhehi \textsanskrit{tīhi} janehi \textsanskrit{kataṁ}, \textsanskrit{sabbamidaṁ} \textsanskrit{kiccaṁ} \textsanskrit{lāmakaṁ} \textsanskrit{nimmariyādaṁ} \textsanskrit{adhammikaṁ}}, “What the three of us have done is all low, outside of acceptable bounds, and unrighteous.” }  And he fell out of the tree right there. 

\begin{verse}%
\scspeaker{The\marginnote{1.27.0} low-caste man says: }\\
‘Neither understands what is good,\footnote{The attribution of speakers is according to Sp 2.647. } \\
Neither sees the Truth: \\
Not he who teaches the Vedas, \\
Nor he who learns improperly.’ 

\scspeaker{The\marginnote{1.31.0} brahmin replies: }\\
‘I’ve eaten the finest rice, \\
With a curry of pure meat: \\
Therefore I’m not practicing the Teaching, \\
The Teaching praised by the Noble Ones.’ 

\scspeaker{The\marginnote{1.35.0} low-caste man replies in turn: }\\
‘A curse it is the obtaining of wealth, \\
And so is becoming popular, brahmin; \\
These things come with a low rebirth, \\
Or with wrong-headed behavior. 

‘Go\marginnote{1.39} forth, great brahmin, \\
Other beings will do the cooking; \\
Don’t go against the Teaching, \\
Because you’ll break like a jar.’ 

%
\end{verse}

Even\marginnote{1.43} at that time, monks, I was displeased by someone teaching the Vedas while sitting on a low seat to someone sitting on a high seat. How, then, could it not be displeasing now? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘“I will not give a teaching while sitting on a low seat to anyone sitting on a high seat who is not sick,” this is how you should train.’” }

One\marginnote{1.47} should not give a teaching while sitting on a low seat to anyone sitting on a high seat who is not sick. If a monk, out of disrespect, gives a teaching while sitting on a low seat to someone sitting on a high seat who is not sick, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time the monks from the group of six were defecating, urinating, and spitting in water. People complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan monastics defecate, urinate, and spit in water? They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 

The\marginnote{1.5} monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How can the monks from the group of six do this?” … “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.9} true, sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.10} Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsubsection*{Preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘“I will not defecate, urinate, or spit in water,” this is how you should train.’” }

In\marginnote{1.15} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards, being afraid of wrongdoing, sick monks did not defecate, urinate, or spit in water. They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow a sick monk to defecate, urinate, or spit in water. }

And\marginnote{2.5} so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘“When not sick, I will not defecate, urinate, or spit in water,” this is how you should train.’” }

If\marginnote{2.7} one is not sick, one should not defecate, urinate, or spit in water. If, out of disrespect, a monk who is not sick defecates, urinates, or spits in water, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. 

\subsection*{Non-offenses }

There\marginnote{2.9.1} is no offense: if it is unintentional;  if he is not mindful;  if he does not know;  if he is sick;  if he does it on dry ground, but it then spreads to water;  if there is an emergency;  if he is insane;  if he is deranged;  if he is overwhelmed by pain;  if he is the first offender.

\section*{The Translator}

Bhikkhu Brahmali was born Norway in 1964. He first became interested in Buddhism and meditation in his early 20s after a visit to Japan. Having completed degrees in engineering and finance, he began his monastic training as an anagarika (keeping the eight precepts) in England at Amaravati and Chithurst Buddhist Monastery.

After hearing teachings from Ajahn Brahm he decided to travel to Australia to train at Bodhinyana Monastery. Bhikkhu Brahmali has lived at Bodhinyana Monastery since 1994, and was ordained as a Bhikkhu, with Ajahn Brahm as his preceptor, in 1996. In 2015 he entered his 20th Rains Retreat as a fully ordained monastic and received the title Maha Thera (Great Elder).

Bhikkhu Brahmali’s knowledge of the Pali language and of the Suttas is excellent. Bhikkhu Bodhi, who translated most of the Pali Canon into English for Wisdom Publications, called him one of his major helpers for the 2012 translation of \emph{The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha}. He has also published two essays on Dependent Origination and a book called \emph{The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts} with the Buddhist Publication Society in collaboration with Bhante Sujato.

The monastics of the Buddhist Society of WA (BSWA) often turn to him to clarify Vinaya (monastic discipline) or Sutta questions. They also greatly appreciate his Sutta and Pali classes. Furthermore he has been instrumental in most of the building and maintenance projects at Bodhinyana Monastery and at the emerging Hermit Hill property in Serpentine.

\section*{Creation Process}

Translated from the Pali. The primary source was the \textsanskrit{Mahāsaṅgīti} edition, with occasional reference to other Pali editions, especially the \textsanskrit{Chaṭṭha} \textsanskrit{Saṅgāyana} edition and the Pali Text Society edition. I cross-checked with I.B. Horner’s English translation, “The Book of the Discipline”, as well as Bhikkhu \textsanskrit{Ñāṇatusita}’s “A Translation and Analysis of the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha}” and Ajahn \textsanskrit{Ṭhānissaro}’s “Buddhist Monastic Code”.

\section*{The Translation}

This is the first complete translation of the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka} in English. The aim has been to produce a translation that is easy to read, clear, and accurate, and also modern in vocabulary and style.

SuttaCentral is driven by volunteer contributions, and in addition we employ professional developers. We offer a sponsorship program for high quality translations from the original languages. Financial support for SuttaCentral is handled by the SuttaCentral Development Trust, a charitable trust registered in Australia.

\section*{About Bilara}

“Bilara” means “cat” in Pali, and it is the name of our Computer Assisted Translation (CAT) software. Bilara is a web app that enables translators to translate early Buddhist texts into their own language. These translations are published on SuttaCentral with the root text and translation side by side.

\section*{About SuttaCentral Editions}

The SuttaCentral Editions project makes high quality books from selected Bilara translations. These are published in formats including HTML, EPUB, PDF, and print.

You are welcome to print any of our Editions.
