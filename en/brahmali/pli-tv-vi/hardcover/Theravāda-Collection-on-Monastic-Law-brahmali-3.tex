\scbyline{Bhikkhu Brahmali, 2024}

The present volume is the third of six, the total of which constitutes a complete translation of the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka}, the Monastic Law. This volume consists of the \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī}-\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga}, the Nuns’ \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} rules and their analysis, which I will call the Nuns’ Analysis for short. In the present introduction, I will survey the contents of volume 3, and also make observations of points of particular interest. For a general introduction to the Monastic Law, see volume 1.

The existence of the Nuns’ Analysis is a result of the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}} having a separate \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha}, that is, they have different rules from the monks. Because they have different rules, they have to recite the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} separately, which in turn means that the legal procedures of the two Sanghas were also done apart. And so, given that the Buddha laid different rules for the nuns, he must have envisaged an autonomous nuns’ Sangha from the beginning. This is the basis for the nuns being largely independent of the monks. I will return to this important point just below.

The structure of the Nuns’ Analysis is the same as for the Monks’ Analysis, the Bhikkhu-\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga}, for which see the introduction to volume 1. The classes of rules are the same, with the exception of the \textit{aniyatas}, the “indeterminate offenses”, which do not occur in the \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī}-\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga}. The sequence of the classes is also the same. Altogether the \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī}-\textsanskrit{pātimokkha} consists of 311 rules around which the Nuns’ Analysis is structured. This means that the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}} have 84 more \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} rules than the \textit{bhikkhus}. The \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} rules are distributed as follows over the various classes of offenses:

\begin{enumerate}%
\item 8 offenses entailing expulsion, \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājikas}} (Pj)%
\item 17 offenses entailing suspension, \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesas}} (Ss)%
\item 30 offenses entailing relinquishment and confession, \textit{nissaggiya \textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} (NP)%
\item 166 offenses entailing confession, \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} (Pc)%
\item 8 offenses entailing acknowledgment, \textit{\textsanskrit{pāṭidesanīyas}} (Pd)%
\item 75 rules of training, \textit{sekhiyas} (Sk)%
\item 7 principles for settling legal issues, \textit{\textsanskrit{adhikaraṇasamathadhammas}}, or just \textit{\textsanskrit{adhikaraṇasamathas}} (As).%
\end{enumerate}

These rules can be divided into those that are in common with the monks and those that are unique to the nuns. As to the rules held in common, the nuns are to practice them in the same way as the monks (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd20/en/brahmali\#4.1.3}{Kd~20:4.1.3}). This means that there is a separate \textit{\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga}}, “analysis”, only for the rules that are unique to the nuns. The distribution of shared and unique rules is as follows:

\begin{description}%
\item[8 \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājikas}} (Pj)] 4 shared with monks%
\item[17 \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesas}} (Ss)] 4 unique to nuns%
\item[30 \textit{nissaggiya \textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} (NP)] 7 shared%
\item[166 \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} (Pc)] 10 unique%
\item[8 \textit{\textsanskrit{pāṭidesanīyas}} (Pd)] 18 shared%
\item[75 \textit{sekhiyas} (Sk)] 12 unique%
\item[7 \textit{\textsanskrit{adhikaraṇasamathas}} (As)] 70 shared%
\end{description}

We see here that the \textit{sekhiyas} and the \textit{\textsanskrit{adhikaraṇasamathas}} are exactly the same for the monks and the nuns. That the \textit{sekhiyas} are the same may be because the social etiquette of monks and nuns was determined by their status as monastics rather than the gender differences as found in society at large.

More interesting are the \textit{\textsanskrit{adhikaraṇasamathas}}. As I discussed briefly in the introduction to volume 1, these are the overarching rules that govern the execution of Sangha business. That they are the same for monks and nuns suggests that the overall framework for the governance of the two Sanghas is the same. Given, as we have seen above, that the two Sanghas operate independently of each other, this means that the nuns have internal autonomy in their decision making, with no possibility for the monks to interfere. Thus, the \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī}-sangha may well be the world’s first attested large-scale institution governed by women. There are a few exceptions to this autonomy, which I will return to in the introduction to volume 5.

\section*{Differences between the Nuns’ Analysis and the Monks’ Analysis}

Beyond the similarities sketched out above, there are some important differences between the two sets of rules. The first, as noted above, is the absence in the nuns’ rules of the class called \textit{aniyata}, of which the monks have two rules. As I have argued in the introduction to volume 1, these rules were laid down to give lay women a voice when monks acted in sexually inappropriate ways. Because of the imbalance in power between the genders in ancient India, there was presumably no need to have equivalent rules for the nuns.

The second obvious difference is in the number of rules, with the nuns having 84 more rules than the monks. One might expect this to be the result of discrimination against women in a patriarchal culture. Although this is likely to be part of the explanation, the reality is more complex.

The main reason why the nuns have more rules is simply that they inherited most of their rules from the monks, in total 181 out of 311, whereas there is no evidence that the monks inherited anything from the nuns. There is no discussion in the Canonical texts of how or by whom these rules were selected, but it seems reasonable to think that it was done to create a foundation for the nuns’ training. The chosen rules were presumably the ones considered most relevant.

A second reason is that the nuns’ rules were added to for a considerable period after the monks’ rules were fixed. This can be seen by comparing the rules across the various schools for which we still have a nuns’ \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha}.\footnote{Kabilsingh, 1998. } Whereas the monks’ rules, with the exception of the \textit{sekhiyas}, are very similar across the different schools,\footnote{Pachow, 2000. } the nuns’ rules vary significantly, especially among the \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}}.\footnote{Kabilsingh, 1984. } It may be that the monks’ position as teachers and instructors of the nuns disposed them to lay down new rules into the sectarian period, decades and even centuries after the Buddha had passed away.

There are further reasons why the nuns have more rules. To enable a proper discussion of this, however, I will first have to discuss the rules. I will then return to this question toward the end of this introduction. Before turning to the rules, there are a few more general issues worthy of attention.

Although the \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī}-\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga} has the same basic structure as the Monks’ Analysis, it is much shorter and simpler. For instance, the four \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājikas}} that are common to the two Sanghas cover a total of 109 pages in the PTS edition, whereas the four \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājikas}} unique to the nuns cover just 11 pages. Although the difference is especially pronounced for the \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} rules, it is symptomatic of the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga} as a whole.

The difference in the extent of the two \textit{\textsanskrit{vibhaṅgas}} is most obvious in two areas: the permutation series and the case studies. Whereas the monks’ rules often have long permutation series attached to them, this is only the case for the nuns’ fifth \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} rule. As to the case studies, there is none in the Nuns’ Analysis. It is interesting, however, that as part of the case studies pertaining to the monks’ rules, there are a few cases that actually concern nuns, including two in \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} 1, three in \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} 2, and one in \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} 3.\footnote{Respectively at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali\#10.5.1}{Bu~Pj~1:10.5.1}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali\#10.6.6}{Bu~Pj~1:10.6.6}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2/en/brahmali\#7.6.20}{Bu~Pj~2:7.6.20}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2/en/brahmali\#7.45.1}{Bu~Pj~2:7.45.1}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2/en/brahmali\#7.45.12}{Bu~Pj~2:7.45.12}, and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj3/en/brahmali\#5.33.10}{Bu~Pj~3:5.33.10}. } These stories may originally have been part of a larger \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī}-\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga} or perhaps it was considered expedient from the start to consolidate all the case studies in one place. Lastly, apart from the permutation series and the case studies, the 130 rules that are unique to the nuns are rarely amended, thus reducing the overall length of the origin stories. The nuns only have four amended unique rules as compared to a total of 39 for the monks.\footnote{This is not counting the eight \textit{\textsanskrit{pāṭidesanīyas}} for \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}}. Although these are normally included in the count of 130 unique rules for the nuns, for all practical purposes they are shared with Bu Pc 39. The four amended rules are \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3/en/brahmali\#1.16.1}{Bi~Ss~3}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51/en/brahmali\#1.12.1}{Bi~Pc~51}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc84/en/brahmali\#1.1.14.1}{Bi~Pc~84}, and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc85/en/brahmali\#1.1.14.1}{Bi~Pc~85}. For the monks the equivalent is 39 out of 227. I include all the monks’ rules, not just the unique ones, because they all originated with the monks. In effect, we are comparing the \textit{\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga}} of the rules that originated with the nuns to the \textit{\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga}} of the rules that originated with the monks. }

There are probably a number of reasons for these differences between the two \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅgas}. An obvious one is that the nuns’ rules were generally laid down later than those of the monks. They would have had less time to evolve, especially during the Buddha’s lifetime. A second reason is that we have grounds to believe that the monks were the chief maintainers of the Vinaya. Both the first and the second Councils, \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅgītis}}, were only attended by monks. Moreover, the nuns are repeatedly depicted, especially in the Bhikkhuni-kkhandhaka, as depending on the monks for their understanding of the Vinaya.\footnote{See \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd20/en/brahmali\#6.1.1}{Kd~20:6.1.1}–8.1.13. } Third, the monks are likely to have had the most experts on the Monastic Law. They had better access to the Buddha, they started earlier, and there were more of them. The final reason is the patriarchal culture that would have regarded it as more important to analyze the monks’ rules. This would have been especially so after the Buddha passed away, which is when most of the \textit{\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga}} material was laid down.

\section*{The personalities of the \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī}-\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga}}

In the introduction to the Bhikkhu-\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga} in volume 1, we looked at some of the characters that feature in the origin stories. As it happens, the nuns too have their fair share of notorious personalities. To start with, we find a group of six nuns, who seem to be modeled on the group of six monks.\footnote{Alternatively, they can be understood as the nuns belonging to the group of six, that is, they were affiliated with the group of six monks. } Sometimes the group of six nuns commit exactly the same misconduct as the group of six monks. They accumulate bowls and refuse to return bowls relinquished by others (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-np1/en/brahmali\#1.2}{Bi~NP~1} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-np1/en/brahmali\#3.1}{Bi~NP~1:3.1}), which is exactly what the group of six monks do (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np21/en/brahmali\#1.2}{Bu~NP~21}). Then we have the fact that the group of six nuns use oversize bathing robes (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc22/en/brahmali\#1.4}{Bi~Pc~22}), as do the group six monks (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc91/en/brahmali\#1.4}{Bu~Pc~91}), and that the group of six nuns ask for fine foods (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pd1/en/brahmali\#1.1.1}{Bi~Pd~1–8}), just like their monastic brothers (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39/en/brahmali\#1.1}{Bu~Pc~39}). There are a number of further similarities that I will leave out in the name of brevity. Yet most telling of all is that the group of six nuns are said to be the originators of all, or virtually all, of the \textit{sekhiya} offenses for nuns,\footnote{The \textit{sekhiya} section for nuns is contracted, and so it is not obvious whether all the origin stories feature the group of six nuns, or whether they just feature in the same rules as do the group of six monks, that is, 72 out of 75. } just as the group of six monks are the originators of the same offenses for monks. These origin stories make little sense because the \textit{sekhiyas} are clearly a common set of rules that do not require separate origin stories for the nuns. So it seems as if the group of six nuns, as in the case of the group of six monks, often function as a convenient group upon which offenses were projected, especially in cases where the original perpetrators had been forgotten.

The group of six does not exhaust the rogues’ gallery of notorious nuns. The two most infamous nuns in the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka} are \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} and, to a lesser extent, her unruly disciple \textsanskrit{Caṇḍakāḷī}. \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} is the original offender for a large number of the rules that are unique to the nuns: two out of four \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājikas}}, four of ten \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesas}}, seven of twelve \textit{nissaggiya \textsanskrit{pācittiyas}}, and lastly twenty-four of ninety-six \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}}. \textsanskrit{Thullanandā}’s student \textsanskrit{Caṇḍakāḷī} is the originator of a further two \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesas}}, as well as four \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}}.

Where \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} is not the originator of a rule, she is often involved in other ways. It seems \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} was one of four sisters, all of whom became nuns (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5/en/brahmali\#1.6}{Bi~Pj~5:1.6}). One of her sisters, \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā}, was the originator of Bi Pj 5, which is concerned with lustful bodily contact. The origin story to the following rule, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6/en/brahmali\#1.2}{Bi~Pj~6}, carries on from the previous one, with \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} hiding the \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} offense of the same sister, who has now become pregnant by her lover. In this way \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} herself becomes the originator of a \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} offense. At \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12/en/brahmali\#1.2}{Bi~Ss~12} it is \textsanskrit{Thullanandā}’s students who behave badly and then hide each other’s offenses. In the following rule, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13/en/brahmali\#1.2}{Bi~Ss~13}, \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} disregards the Sangha’s admonishment and encourages her students to carry on as before. And so, two \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesa}} offenses come into being.

\textsanskrit{Thullanandā} was well disposed toward some of the most notorious monks of the time. She praises Devadatta and his followers, comparing them favorably to some of the Buddha’s greatest disciples, including \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} and \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna} (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29/en/brahmali\#1.9}{Bu~Pc~29:1.9}). At another time, she dismisses a number of senior monks so that she can ordain a trainee nun with the help of Devadatta and his friends (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc81/en/brahmali\#1.1}{Bi~Pc~81:1.1}). She is also connected to other disreputable monks, such as \textsanskrit{Ariṭṭha} who was ejected from the Bhikkhu-sangha for his wrong views (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd11/en/brahmali\#32.3.25}{Kd~11:32.3.25}). When she takes his side, she becomes the offender giving rise to \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj7/en/brahmali\#1.1}{Bi~Pj~7}. With such bad friends, it is hardly surprising \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} would be a difficult character herself, in turn also affecting her own students, particularly \textsanskrit{Caṇḍakāḷī}.

Indeed, \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} comes across as troublesome and difficult, rarely accepting the authority of the Sanghas. As we have seen, \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} disregards the Sangha’s admonishment (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13/en/brahmali\#1.2}{Bi~Ss~13:1.2}). Elsewhere, she readmits \textsanskrit{Caṇḍakāḷī} without consultation after the latter had been ejected by the Sangha, thus giving rise to a \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesa}} offense (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4/en/brahmali\#1.16}{Bi~Ss~4:1.16}). She also reviles the community of nuns out of anger (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc53/en/brahmali\#1.18}{Bi~Pc~53}).

In a significant number of \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} rules \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} is portrayed as selfish and inconsiderate toward other nuns, including her own students (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc33/en/brahmali\#1.1}{Bi~Pc~33}–\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc35/en/brahmali\#1.1}{35}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc45/en/brahmali\#1.1}{45}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc47/en/brahmali\#1.1}{47}–\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc48/en/brahmali\#1.1}{48}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc68/en/brahmali\#1.1}{68}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc70/en/brahmali\#1.1}{70}, and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc77/en/brahmali\#1.1}{77}–\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc78/en/brahmali\#1.1}{78}). She was immoderate and greedy, often trying to get extra cloth at the expense of other nuns (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-np2/en/brahmali\#1.1}{Bi~NP~2}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc26/en/brahmali\#1.1}{Bi~Pc~26}–\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc27/en/brahmali\#1.1}{27}, and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc29/en/brahmali\#1.1}{29}–\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc30/en/brahmali\#1.1}{30}). She would often engage in trading, e.g. at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-np3/en/brahmali\#1.1}{Bi~NP~3}–\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-np5/en/brahmali\#1.1}{5} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-np10/en/brahmali\#1.1}{10}–\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-np12/en/brahmali\#1.1}{12}, and she curried favors with householders (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc28/en/brahmali\#1.1}{Bi~Pc~28} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc46/en/brahmali\#1.1}{46}). We even have a \textsanskrit{Jātaka} tale where we witness \textsanskrit{Thullanandā}’s greed also in a past life, in this case highlighting the negative consequences of excessive desires (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1/en/brahmali\#1.25.1}{Bi~Pc~1}).

Yet, as has been pointed out,\footnote{Ohnuma, 2013. } \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} is a more complex character than she might appear at first sight. According to the origin stories to several rules, especially \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-np10/en/brahmali\#1.2}{Bi~NP~10}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-np11/en/brahmali\#1.2}{11}, and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-np12/en/brahmali\#1.2}{12}, she is a learned, confident, and gifted teacher of the Dhamma, with many people visiting her and making offerings. At Bi NP 11 and 12, she inspires King Pasenadi with a Dhamma talk to the point where he makes her the generous offer to ask for anything she wants. The background story to \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss4/en/brahmali\#1.1}{Bi~Ss~4} suggests she was an expert on the Monastic Law. According to \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29/en/brahmali\#1.2}{Bu~Pc~29}, she was invited to receive regular meals from householders, showing that she was well respected. The origin story to \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1/en/brahmali\#1.25}{Bi~Ss~1} shows her standing up for the rights of \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}}, hinting, perhaps, that she was an early feminist. The origin story to \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2/en/brahmali\#1.1}{Bi~Ss~2} might be read in a similar light.\footnote{See Ohnuma, pp. 53–56. }

We are left with the portrait of a complex character. This, of course, is exactly what we would expect of a real person, for human beings are rarely one-dimensional. In fact, the number and nature of the details we have from \textsanskrit{Thullanandā}’s life suggest she is a historical figure. In addition to what we have seen already, these details include her involvement in plots that carry on over several rules and her association with monks who are well attested in the Pali tradition, such as Ānanda and \textsanskrit{Mahākassapa}. Significantly, she is encountered with similar frequency also in the other schools of Buddhism.\footnote{For instance, in the \textsanskrit{Mahāsaṅghika} Vinaya, where she is the originator of a large number of rules, including, Bi Ss 4, 9, 15, and 18; and Bi NP 11, 12, 13, 16, 18, and 29. }

Given these details of \textsanskrit{Thullanandā}’s character, it is perhaps not surprising that she is involved, directly and indirectly, in so many offenses. This is probably what we should expect from a strong, fiery, and sometimes problematic personality. Nevertheless, it seems likely that she was at times a convenient scapegoat, especially in the many cases where the true origin story had been forgotten. In the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī} nissaggiya \textsanskrit{pācittiyas}}, for instance, a total of nine very similar rules are attributed to \textsanskrit{Thullanandā}’s misbehavior. It is hard not to suspect that her name was sometimes copied and pasted from one rule to the next.

\section*{The \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājikas}} (Pj)}

The nuns have eight \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} rules, consisting of the same four as the monks and an additional four that are unique to the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}}. I have discussed the general aspects of the \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājikas}} in the introduction to volume 1. Here I will focus on the aspects that are peculiar to the nuns.

Of the four \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājikas}} that the nuns have in common with the monks, the first one is in fact slightly different.\footnote{In other schools of Buddhism, such as the \textsanskrit{Mahāsaṅghikas}, the rules are identical. See the translations by \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{Vimalañāṇī} at https://vimalanyani.github.io/vinaya-lzh/mg/pm/. } First, the nuns’ version adds the word \textit{chandaso}, “willingly”, and second, it omits the phrase \textit{\textsanskrit{sikkhaṁ} \textsanskrit{appaccakkhāya} \textsanskrit{dubbalyaṁ} \textsanskrit{anāvikatvā}}, “without first renouncing the training and revealing his/her weakness”. Both of these differences are worthy of a brief discussion.

The purpose of adding the word “willingly” is presumably to acknowledge the problem of rape in ancient India and to ensure that the nuns were not penalized for being the victims of violence. There is no origin story, however, that explains the circumstances in which this addition was made, as is normally the case for the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} rules. It could be that this addition to the rule has its origin in the story of \textsanskrit{Uppalavaṇṇā}, found among the case stories to \textit{bhikkhu \textsanskrit{pārājika}} 1 (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali\#10.5.1}{Bu~Pj~1:10.5.1}). This might in fact be the reason for the presence of this story in the Bhikkhu-\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga}. At some point the connection between this origin story and the reformulation of the rule was lost, probably because the rules that the nuns have in common with the monks were only preserved in the monks’ \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha}.\footnote{In the Pali tradition, the full nuns’ \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} is now only found in the \textsanskrit{Dvemātikāpāḷi}, a sub-commentary. } What is indisputable, however, is that, according to the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga}, a monk too would not commit a \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} if he were the victim of rape.\footnote{The non-offense clause of \textit{bhikkhu \textsanskrit{pārājika}} 1, at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali\#9.7.25}{Bu~Pj~1:9.7.25}, shows that a monk can only commit a \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} if he consents. } This makes it likely that the addition to the nuns’ rule must have happened before this portion of the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga} existed. Once again, we see that the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga} material is likely to be later than the majority of \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} rules.

The reason for the absence of the phrase “without first renouncing the training and revealing her weakness” can be explained in two different ways. The straightforward explanation comes from a passage according to which the nuns, in contrast to the monks, are not allowed to disrobe by verbally rejecting the training (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd20/en/brahmali\#26.1.4}{Kd~20:26.1.4}).\footnote{The referenced passage from the Bhikkhuni-kkhandhaka says that a nun disrobes by removing her robes and putting on lay clothes. } There is, however, an alternative and more intriguing possibility. Once the word \textit{chandaso} had been added to the nuns’ rule, it could no longer be considered as fully in common with the monks. A consequence of this might be that it became unnatural to update the nuns’ rule as a result of changes to the monks’ rule. It follows from this rather speculative premise that if “willingly” was added to the nuns’ rule before “without first renouncing the training and revealing his weakness” was added to the monks’ version, then the latter may never have made its way into the nuns’ version. My suggestion, then, is that the prohibition at Kd 20 against a nun verbally renouncing the training may have its origin in this phrase missing from the nuns’ version of \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} 1, which in turn might be the result of an accident of history. If the Khandhakas are generally later than the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} rules, as seems to be the case, this would at least be a possible unfolding of events.

Coming to the \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} rules that are unique to the nuns, \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} 5 concerns lustful physical contact. The question arises why this is a more serious offense for the nuns than for the monks, for whom this is a \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesa}} offense at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2/en/brahmali\#1.2.15.1}{Bu~Ss~2}. In fact, such disparity between the monks and the nuns in the consequences of performing the same action is not unique to this case. According to \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6/en/brahmali\#1.23.1}{Bi~Pj~6}, concealing another nun’s \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} offense is itself a \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}}, yet for the monks this is no more than a \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} offense at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc64/en/brahmali\#1.23.1}{Bu~Pc~64}. According to \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj7/en/brahmali\#1.11.1}{Bi~Pj~7}, a nun who sides with an ejected monk again commits a \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} offense, whereas for a monk the even graver action of siding with a schismatic results in a \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesa}} at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss11/en/brahmali\#1.19.1}{Bu~Ss~11}. Then there are a number of \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} rules for the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}} that for the monks are minor rules found outside the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha}.\footnote{Whether this is a true disparity depends on how one regards such non-\textit{\textsanskrit{pātimokkha}} rules. If they are regarded as confessable offenses, they are for all practical purposes the same as the \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}}. } These include the rule against eating garlic, respectively at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc1/en/brahmali\#1.41.1}{Bi~Pc~1} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali\#34.1.15}{Kd~15:34.1.15}, the rule against entertainment at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc10/en/brahmali\#1.15.1}{Bi~Pc~10} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali\#2.6.6}{Kd~15:2.6.6}, the rule against using luxurious furniture at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc42/en/brahmali\#1.14.1}{Bi~Pc~42} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd5/en/brahmali\#10.5.2}{Kd~5:10.5.2}, and more.

Yet the disparity also goes the other way, with the monks sometimes being penalized more heavily for the same action. An obvious example is masturbation, which is a \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesa}} for monks at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1/en/brahmali\#2.1.13.1}{Bu~Ss~1}, whereas for the nuns it is a \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc3/en/brahmali\#1.14.1}{Bi~Pc~3} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc4/en/brahmali\#1.21.1}{4}. Other important examples are several \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesa}} offenses for the monks, in particular the offenses for indecent speech and for building dwellings that are too large—at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3/en/brahmali\#1.2.14.1}{Bu~Ss~3}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4/en/brahmali\#1.2.19.1}{4}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6/en/brahmali\#1.6.6.1}{6}, and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7/en/brahmali\#1.19.1}{7}—which are not offenses at all for the nuns.\footnote{It might be objected that the nuns too have a large number of rules that the monks do not have. We will return to this question at the end of this introduction. } There is also the interesting case of homosexual sex being a \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} for monks, but generally no more than a \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} for nuns. There are a number of other examples of lesser importance.

Why this disparity? A traditional explanation might be that the Buddha understood the psychological differences between men and women and so tailored the rules to each gender. Yet there is little evidence for this. What we do know, however, is that the Buddha often lays down rules because of complaints from lay people. Such complaints would have been colored by social expectations, causing gender differences in society to make their way into the monastic rules, at least partially. Indeed, it seems reasonable to assume that the Buddha himself would have taken such societal expectations into account when laying down rules, whether intentionally or through default reaction. This might explain, for instance, why the nuns incur a \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} offense for lustful physical contact, whereas the monks incur a \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesa}} offense. Unfair as this may seem from a contemporary point of view, society may well have judged it as coarser and more serious for a female to initiate such contact.

Another reason for the disparity is the difference in historical evolution of the two \textsanskrit{Pātimokkhas}. As we have seen, the monks’ rules were closed to addition earlier than the nuns’ rules. The same inappropriate action may then have led to a new \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} rule for the nuns, while for the monks it may have led to the laying down of an act of wrong conduct in the Khandhakas. And indeed, we see a number of such cases.\footnote{The equivalents are listed in the long footnote in the last section of this introduction. }

Finally, it may be the case that the Buddha occasionally did lay down rules based on what he perceived as psychological differences between the two genders. Clearly the Buddha had exceptional insight into human psychology, the Dhamma essentially being a manual of the path to psychological well-being. Still, we should not overestimate such a motivation in the absence of evidence. In the area of Monastic Law, the Buddha is generally depicted as a pragmatist who reacted to external demands, and rarely if ever as a visionary who worked from more fundamental principles.

Let’s briefly consider the remaining \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājikas}}. As we have seen, \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} 6 concerns hiding another nun’s \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} offense, whereas \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} 7 is about siding with an ejected monk. \textit{\textsanskrit{Pārājika}} 8 again concerns inappropriate association with the opposite gender. This rule is unique in that it requires the offending nun to do a series of eight separate actions before the offense is committed.\footnote{According to the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga}, each of these actions is a \textit{thullaccaya}, “a serious offense”, in its own right. } The likelihood that someone would now commit exactly the same eight actions may seem small. At the same time, if one gets trapped in infatuation, it is surprising how unskillful actions can accumulate, eventually leading to the sort of scenario we see in this rule. This rule also presents us with some interesting interpretative challenges, for which see Appendix II: Technical Discussion of Individual \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī} Rules.

\section*{The \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesas}} (Ss)}

The nuns have seventeen \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesa}} offenses, of which seven are in common with the monks. This means the nuns have ten unique \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesas}}, while the monks have six. Moreover, the nuns have a total of nine \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesas}} that are immediate offenses, whereas eight are offenses after the performance of a legal procedure of one motion and three announcements. In other words, the nuns must make greater use of \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghakamma}} in the lead up to a \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesa}} offense than must the monks. As with the monks, this \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghakamma}} functions, in effect, as an extended admonishment, giving the offender extra time to reconsider their actions.

Although this class of offenses is common to the two Sanghas, there are some important differences in the practical application. Where the monks have a six-day trial period, \textit{\textsanskrit{mānatta}}, the nuns have half a month. On the other hand, the nuns have no probation period, \textit{\textsanskrit{parivāsa}}, for hiding their offenses. Most likely this difference is due to the fact that a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} cannot live alone and thus requires another \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} to stay with her (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd20/en/brahmali\#25.3.1}{Kd~20:25.3.1}). If the nuns had to undergo a sometimes-lengthy \textit{\textsanskrit{parivāsa}} for hiding their offenses, this would require a designated chaperone for extended periods of time, which would be an unreasonable burden on other nuns. An additional possible explanation for the difference is that some of the monks’ \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesas}} may have been regarded as more embarrassing and thus more likely to be hidden. It is also the case that the period of penance sometimes made the process of emerging from a \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesa}} offense especially cumbersome, as can be seen from \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd13/en/brahmali}{Kd~13}. Penance may have been scrapped for the nuns because it sometimes made rehabilitation unnecessarily complicated.

Another point worthy of brief comment is the fact that the half-monthly trial period for nuns is laid down twice, both at the end of the nuns’ \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesa}} offenses and in the \textit{garudhammas}.\footnote{The \textit{garudhammas} are a set of rules that, according to the tradition, were laid down when the Buddha’s foster mother \textsanskrit{Mahāpajāpati} \textsanskrit{Gotamī} was ordained as the first \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd20/en/brahmali\#1.4.1}{Kd~20:1.4.1}–1.5.23). The status of these rules, including whether they are binding on \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}}, is controversial. See discussion in see Bhikkhu Sujato, “Bhikkhuni Vinaya Studies”, pp. 46–74. } This leads to the obvious question of which is prior. Without going into a detailed discussion, it seems to fit better at the end of the \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesas}} where it parallels the equivalent section for the monks. This is one among a number of cases where the \textit{garudhammas} are at odds with other parts of the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka}, suggesting that they may not go back to the earliest period.

Each of the nuns’ \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesa}} offenses includes the qualifier \textit{\textsanskrit{nissāraṇīya}}, “entailing sending away”, not shared with the monks. This relates to the trial period, and is explained in the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga} as sending away from the Sangha, which parallels a similar rule for monks at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd12/en/brahmali\#2.1.6}{Kd~12:2.1.6}. The problem with such sending away is that it seems to clash with \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3/en/brahmali\#4.14.1}{Bi~Ss~3}, which says that a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} cannot stay by herself. As we have seen, this is resolved by the Sangha appointing a companion to the nun observing the trial period (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd20/en/brahmali\#25.3.5}{Kd~20:25.3.5}). Alternatively, given that the Khandhakas are generally later than the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} rules, we may wonder whether in the earliest period it was acceptable for nuns to live alone.

Returning to the comparison of the nuns’ rules with those of the monks, the monks’ six \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesa}} offenses not shared with the nuns are \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesas}} 1–4 and 6–7. Although these rules are not shared within the same class of rules, two of them have rough equivalents elsewhere in \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī}-\textsanskrit{pātimokkha}. We have seen that \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1/en/brahmali\#2.1.13.1}{Bu~Ss~1} finds an approximate equivalent in \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc3/en/brahmali\#1.14.1}{Bi~Pc~3} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc4/en/brahmali\#1.21.1}{4}, whereas \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss2/en/brahmali\#1.2.15.1}{Bu~Ss~2} resembles \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5/en/brahmali\#1.54.1}{Bi~Pj~5}. Of the remaining four rules—\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss3/en/brahmali\#1.2.14.1}{Bu~Ss~3}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss4/en/brahmali\#1.2.19.1}{4}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss6/en/brahmali\#1.6.6.1}{6}, and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7/en/brahmali\#1.19.1}{7}—there is no equivalent for the nuns.

Let’s now consider the \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesa}} offenses that are unique to the nuns. Some of these rules have understandably caused concern among modern \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}}. These rules were perhaps reasonable in ancient India, but not so much in the modern context. For instance, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss1/en/brahmali\#1.56.1}{Bi~Ss~1} prohibits a nun from taking legal action, which from a modern perspective hampers nuns in seeking redress for injustices and is therefore nothing short of discriminatory. Fortunately, the non-offense clause allows for legal action in cases where the nuns need protection. A broad understanding of this makes it possible to justify legal action whenever a nun or the nuns’ community has been treated unfairly, effectively restricting the rule to malicious legal action.

This leads us to the important question of how to interpret the rules, especially those for the nuns. Because the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka} rules were formulated to fit a society that in many ways is quite different from our own, especially when it comes to the discrimination against women, we need to look for principles of interpretation that make the \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī}-sangha sustainable. We have seen that the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} rules are generally older than the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga} material, which means we should give priority to the rules over the explanatory material. At the same time, we have just seen that for Bi Ss 1 the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga} is more reasonable than the rule. It seems, therefore, that whenever the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga} interprets a rule in a lenient fashion—and, importantly, this happened despite the conservatism of that society—we, that is, the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}}, have the right to follow suit. What I am suggesting, then, is that it is acceptable with any particular rule to choose whether one wishes to follow the rule or the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga}, and that there is no need for a consistent approach across the entire \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha}.

Such a lenient interpretative framework—which still falls within the wording of either the rule or the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga}—becomes especially important when we come to rules, such as \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3/en/brahmali\#4.14.1}{Bi~Ss~3}, that seem particularly restrictive from a modern point of view. This rule, if interpreted strictly, makes it impossible for a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} to travel or live independently. This may have been necessary to protect \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}} in ancient India, but is incompatible with modern sensibilities. With a degree of good will, however, it is possible to interpret this rule such that it is not unreasonably restrictive, even making it possible for a modern \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} to keep it.

The origin story to \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss2/en/brahmali\#1.1}{Bi~Ss~2} is particularly shocking as to the level of sexism in ancient India. A man whose wife has been serially unfaithful goes to a meeting of his clan to get permission to kill her. They agree. The woman then runs away and finds refuge by ordaining as a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}}, setting the stage for a rule against ordaining criminals. The prohibition against ordaining a criminal who is seeking to escape justice is reasonable, and we do in fact have such rules elsewhere, but applicable to both monks and nuns (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali\#43.1.14}{Kd~1:43.1.14}). What is problematic is the treatment of women by society as essentially the property of men, who are then able to mete out punishment largely as they see fit. This goes to show that it is sensible, even necessary, to interpret the nuns’ rules leniently.

Of the remaining \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesa}} offenses that are unique to the nuns, three in particular stand out as different from anything that the monks have. \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss10/en/brahmali\#1.19.1}{Bi~Ss~10} prohibits a nun from verbally rejecting the triple gem in a fit of anger. This rule gets its significance from the fact that nuns, as opposed to monks, cannot renounce the training verbally (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd20/en/brahmali\#26.1.4}{Kd~20:26.1.4}). \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12/en/brahmali\#1.11.1}{Bi~Ss~12} stops nuns from socializing too much, including bad behavior that results from such socializing, whereas \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss13/en/brahmali\#1.23.1}{Bi~Ss~13} stops a nun from encouraging those who socialize inappropriately to continue their bad behavior. We do not know why only the nuns have these rules, but we can perhaps make some educated guesses. One obvious reason is that the nuns were not allowed to live in the wilderness (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd20/en/brahmali\#23.1.4}{Kd~20:23.1.4}), which would have compelled them to live close to general society. This in turn would have made inappropriate socializing more likely. It is also possible that gender stereotypes—whether based on real or imaginary differences—would have played a role.

\section*{The \textit{nissaggiya \textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} (NP)}

The \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}} have the same number of \textit{nissaggiya \textsanskrit{pācittiya}} offenses as the monks, that is, a total of thirty, eighteen being in common and twelve unique to the nuns, which means there are also twelve \textit{nissaggiyas} unique to the monks.

As with \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} 1, there is in fact one shared offense that is not quite shared, namely \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np2/en/brahmali\#2.39.1}{Bu~NP~2}/Bi NP 14. This rule concerns staying apart from one’s robes for a period of more than 24 hours. Because the nuns have five robes, compared to three for the monks, we might expect this difference to be reflected in the rule. Nevertheless, in the Sixth Council edition of the \textsanskrit{Tipiṭaka} we find only three robes mentioned both for the monks and the nuns.\footnote{This reading is found in the \textsanskrit{Chaṭṭhasaṅgāyana} version of the sub-commentary \textsanskrit{Dvemātikāpāli}, which preserves both \textsanskrit{Pātimokkhas}. } According to Bhikkhu \textsanskrit{Ñāṇatusita}’s \textit{\textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} \textsanskrit{Pāḷi}}, however, there are several known Pali manuscripts that mention five robes.\footnote{Nyanatusita, 2010. } Moreover, it seems that all the other schools for which we have a \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī}-\textsanskrit{pātimokkha} mention five robes for \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}} in connection with this rule.\footnote{Private communication from Ven. \textsanskrit{Vimalañāṇī}. } It seems likely, then, that five is the original number.

Of the twelve \textit{nissaggiyas} that are unique to the monks, three concern monks’ inappropriate dealings with nuns.\footnote{\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np4/en/brahmali\#1.31.1}{Bu~NP~4}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np5/en/brahmali\#1.2.31.1}{Bu~NP~5}, and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np17/en/brahmali\#1.20.1}{Bu~NP~17}. } These rules do not exist for nuns, suggesting that the monks were more likely to treat the nuns unfairly than the other way around. Five of the twelve concern blankets, the so-called \textit{santhatas}.\footnote{\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np11/en/brahmali\#1.23.1}{Bu~NP~11}–\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np15/en/brahmali\#1.3.10.1}{15}. } The fact that these rules were not inherited by the nuns may mean either that the \textit{santhata} was not considered an important requisite or, perhaps, that its use was discontinued after the earliest period. In the present day, the \textit{santhata} is all but unknown. Of the four remaining rules, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np24/en/brahmali\#1.18.1}{Bu~NP~24} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np29/en/brahmali\#1.2.16.1}{29} concern situations that are specific to the monks; one, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np16/en/brahmali\#1.23.1}{Bu~NP~16}, is about the rather particular case of carrying unspun wool over long distances; and the final one, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np21/en/brahmali\#2.17.1}{Bu~NP~21}, is similar to \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-np1/en/brahmali\#1.14.1}{Bi~NP~1}.

There is little new in the \textit{nissaggiya} offenses that are unique to the nuns. As mentioned, Bi NP 1 is essentially the same as Bu NP 21. \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-np3/en/brahmali\#1.20.1}{Bi~NP~3}, which prohibits giving a robe and then taking it back, is similar to \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np25/en/brahmali\#1.27.1}{Bu~NP~25}. \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-np4/en/brahmali\#1.27.1}{Bi~NP~4}–12 are in reality little more than special cases of \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np20/en/brahmali\#1.35.1}{Bu~NP~20} = Bi NP 23. That leaves only one \textit{nissaggiya} offense that is properly unique to the nuns, namely \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-np2/en/brahmali\#1.25.1}{Bi~NP~2}, which concerns inappropriately distributing robe-cloth to one’s own monastic followers.

\section*{The \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} (Pc)}

The \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}} have a total of 166 \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} offenses, of which seventy are in common with the monks. This means the nuns have 96 unique \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}}, whereas the monks have 22.

As mentioned above, there is substantial variation in the number of \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} rules for the nuns among the various schools. This contrasts with the other rules, which are largely the same in number. In her comparative study of the \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī}-\textsanskrit{pātimokkha},\footnote{Kabilsingh, 1991. } Kabilsingh shows that the number of \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} rules varies from 141 to 210, which is comparable to the variation among the \textit{sekhiya} rules. This means that rules were added to the nuns’ \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} after the various schools started to form, probably within the first couple of centuries after the Buddha’s passing. We thus see an interesting difference between the monks and the nuns: the \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} of the former were kept largely unaltered from the earliest period, whereas the nuns’ \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} were added to. What might be the reason for this?

We see in the Bhikkhuni-kkhandhaka at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd20/en/brahmali\#6.1.1}{Kd~20:6.1.1}–8.1.13 that the monks were entrusted with teaching the nuns in matters related to the Vinaya. It could be the case, then, that the monks considered themselves authorized to lay down new rules for the nuns, especially in the category of minor rules, that is, the \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}}.\footnote{The \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} are called minor, \textit{khuddaka}, at the end of the relevant section both in the Bhikkhu- and \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī}-\textsanskrit{vibhaṅgas}. } The fact that all the early schools seem to have laid down such rules supports this thesis. Moreover, this is parallel to what happened to the \textit{sekhiya} rules, which were also added to in the sectarian period. Although the \textit{sekhiyas} are binding on both Sanghas, they were probably added to the Bhikkhu-\textsanskrit{pātimokkha}, with the nuns then inheriting the rules. As such, they were primarily considered rules for the monks. My suggestion, then, is that when rules were added to the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkhas} after the Buddha’s passing, they were added to the \textit{sekhiyas} for the monks, but to the \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} for the nuns. In this way, there was a parallel development between the two Sanghas.

Of the 22 \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} that are unique to the monks, ten govern the proper relationship between monks and nuns. The first four of these, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc21/en/brahmali\#1.44.1}{Bu~Pc~21}–24, concern the \textit{\textsanskrit{ovāda}}, the monks’ fortnightly instruction to the nuns. Obviously, the nuns do not have these rules. The next two, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc25/en/brahmali\#2.11.1}{Bu~Pc~25}–26, prohibit monks from giving robes to the nuns. It is not immediately clear why the nuns did not inherit these, that is, nuns being prohibited from giving robes to the monks, but it could be that they were redundant because of the nuns’ difficulties in obtaining requisites. \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc29/en/brahmali\#2.13.1}{Bu~Pc~29} concerns nuns ordering lay people to give food to their favorite monks. It is unsurprising that such a specific rule was not inherited by the nuns. The last three rules, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc27/en/brahmali\#2.15.1}{Bu~Pc~27}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc28/en/brahmali\#2.16.1}{28}, and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc30/en/brahmali\#1.13.1}{30}, relate to monks and nuns associating inappropriately with each other. The fact that the nuns do not have these could be because of the strict requirements of \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3/en/brahmali\#4.14.1}{Bi~Ss~3}, which may have been regarded as sufficient to cover such situations.

A further five rules are not relevant to the nuns because they have other rules covering approximately the same areas.\footnote{\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39/en/brahmali\#2.10.1}{Bu~Pc~39} is the same as \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pd1/en/brahmali\#1.2.9.1}{Bi~Pd~1}–8; \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41/en/brahmali\#1.2.15.1}{Bu~Pc~41} is similar to \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc46/en/brahmali\#1.15.1}{Bi~Pc~46}; \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc64/en/brahmali\#1.23.1}{Bu~Pc~64} has roughly the same scope as \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj6/en/brahmali\#1.23.1}{Bi~Pj~6} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss12/en/brahmali\#1.11.1}{Bi~Ss~12}; \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65/en/brahmali\#1.53.1}{Bu~Pc~65} is covered by \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc65/en/brahmali\#1.17.1}{Bi~Pc~65} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc71/en/brahmali\#1.17.1}{71}; and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc91/en/brahmali\#1.14.1}{Bu~Pc~91} is the same as \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc22/en/brahmali\#1.14.1}{Bi~Pc~22}. } Then there are \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc33/en/brahmali\#3.15.1}{Bu~Pc~33}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35/en/brahmali\#2.15.1}{35}, and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36/en/brahmali\#1.28.1}{36}, all concerned with eating meals in succession, the combined effect of which is no more than a slight expansion of \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc54/en/brahmali\#1.20.1}{Bi~Pc~54}. That the nuns do not have an equivalent of \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc67/en/brahmali\#1.28.1}{Bu~Pc~67}, which concerns monks traveling by arrangement with women, is, again, probably because of \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3/en/brahmali\#4.14.1}{Bi~Ss~3}, which compels a nun always to travel in the company of another nun. Next, because \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}} do not live in the wilderness, they have neither the equivalent of \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc85/en/brahmali\#4.9.1}{Bu~Pc~85}, which concerns forest monks entering an inhabited area at the wrong time, nor \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc89/en/brahmali\#2.10.1}{Bu~Pc~89}, which sets limits on the size of the sitting mat, a requisite that was used mostly in the wilderness. Moreover, given that monks are allowed to be without the sitting mat for up to four months (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali\#18.1.3}{Kd~15:18.1.3}), it would not have been regarded as a particularly important requisite. As to the final rule that the nuns do not share with the monks, that is \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc83/en/brahmali\#1.3.56.1}{Bu~Pc~83}, which concerns entering a royal compound without being announced, it is less clear why the nuns do not have it. Perhaps the reason is simply that nuns were not considered as potential competitors to the king for the attention of his wives.

The overall impression is that there are sufficiently good reasons why the nuns did not inherit certain of the monks’ \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} rules. It is not always equally clear-cut, however, why the nuns were given ninety-six additional \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}}. Let’s have a closer look at them.

In many cases the unique rules for the nuns are found elsewhere for the monks, sometimes with a different wording or belonging to a different class of offense. Without getting distracted by the details and bearing in mind that the boundaries are often blurry, I count 22 such rules for the nuns, some of which are significant, including rules concerned with sexuality (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc3/en/brahmali\#1.14.1}{Bi~Pc~3}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc4/en/brahmali\#1.21.1}{4}, and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc5/en/brahmali\#1.2.12.1}{5}), entertainment (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc10/en/brahmali\#1.15.1}{Bi~Pc~10}), and the invitation ceremony (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc57/en/brahmali\#1.15.1}{Bi~Pc~57}).\footnote{Other rules I count as belonging to this category are as follows: Bi Pc 1–2, 22, 31–33, 35, 39, 42, 49–50, 54, 68–69, 74, and 84–85. } On top of these, I count an additional 14 rules that are effectively just minor expansions of the monks’ rules.\footnote{Bi Pc 7, 11–14, 46, 76, 80, 86–87, and 90–93. } This leaves a total of 60 \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} that are genuinely unique to the nuns and worthy of special attention.\footnote{Bi Pc 6, 8–9, 15–21, 23–30, 34, 36–38, 40–41, 43–45, 47–48, 51–53, 55–56, 58–67, 70–73, 75, 77–79, 81–83, 88–89, and 94–96. }

Especially noteworthy among these latter rules are the large number concerned with ordination and related issues, in total 18, compared to only one such \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} rule for the monks.\footnote{Bi Pc 61–83, that is, 23 rules in all. Five of these, Bi Pc 68, 69, 74, 76, and 80 are included in the rules already mentioned, thus a total of 18 of the remaining 60 rules. The single such rule for monks is \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65/en/brahmali\#1.53.1}{Bu~Pc~65}. } Some of these rules concern special circumstances for women, such as \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc61/en/brahmali\#1.17.1}{Bi~Pc~61} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc62/en/brahmali\#1.17.1}{62} that prohibit the ordination of women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Other rules concern the more complicated leadup to the ordination of women, with rules mandating a period of two years as a trainee nun, a \textit{\textsanskrit{sikkhamānā}}, and rules requiring a special legal procedure to approve a trainee nun for ordination. This is further complicated by the fact that there are three classes of women who may seek ordination: a general class of trainee nuns (\textit{\textsanskrit{sikkhamānā}}), a class of married girls (\textit{gihigata}), and a class of unmarried women (\textit{\textsanskrit{kumāribhūta}}), which leads to a total of eight rules.\footnote{Bi Pc 63–64, 65–67, and 71–73. } It is peculiar that we first find two general rules for trainee nuns and then two subclasses, one for married and one for unmarried women, each with three rules. There is an obvious redundancy here since either the two general rules or the six more specific rules would have been sufficient on their own. One is left with the impression that the general rules were laid down first, possibly by the Buddha, and that the more specific rules were added at a later stage after the Buddha had passed away. We may speculate that the redundancy was caused by a conservative Sangha not being willing to update or abolish rules they regarded as coming from the Master himself.

The existence of different ordination rules for married and unmarried women is interesting. Unmarried women are treated much in the same way as men, with a minimum ordination age of twenty (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc71/en/brahmali\#1.17.1}{Bi~Pc~71}). For married girls, however, the minimum ordination age is set at twelve (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc65/en/brahmali\#1.17.1}{Bi~Pc~65}). This shows, first of all, that the custom of child brides is ancient. The reason why they were allowed to ordain at such a young age seems to be that they were regarded as adults once married. The origin stories to the rules that deal with the minimum age for ordination all have to do with the ability of the ordinand to deal with the hardships of monasticism. In other words, it was probably assumed that the nature of married life was such that it forced you to grow up quickly, enabling you to deal with the difficult realities of life. Since most countries now have a minimum marriage age of eighteen, these rules are largely redundant.

The above ordination rules do not place any restrictions on nuns that are fundamentally different from those of the monks. If anything, the rules are slightly more liberal for the nuns, such as the lower ordination age and the duty to follow your preceptor for only two years, as compared to five years for monks.\footnote{The nuns also have to live as \textit{\textsanskrit{sikkhamānas}} for two years, effectively increasing the number of years of dependence on one’s preceptor to four. Thus the nuns’ rules are only slightly more liberal. } The nuns do, however, have at least two rules that restrict them quite severely in matters of ordination. The first, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc82/en/brahmali\#1.14.1}{Bi~Pc~82}, prohibits a nun from performing ordinations in consecutive years, whereas the other, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc83/en/brahmali\#1.16.1}{Bi~Pc~83}, prohibits her from ordaining more than one person per year. The combined effect of these two rules is to dramatically reduce the growth potential of the \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī}-sangha. This is particularly problematic at a time when the Sangha of nuns has only recently been reestablished in Theravada Buddhism.

Still, the situation is not quite as dire as it may seem. Looking closer at these rules, it becomes clear that only the first of them has any real claim to authenticity. From the comparative information on SuttaCentral,\footnote{See https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc82. } we see that the first rule is found in all six schools, whereas the second one is only found in the Pali tradition. This means that \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc83/en/brahmali\#1.16.1}{Bi~Pc~83} almost certainly originated in the sectarian period. Nonetheless, depending on how it is interpreted, even \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc82/en/brahmali\#1.14.1}{Bi~Pc~82} may severely constrain the growth of the \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī}-sangha.

Besides the rules on ordination, there are a number of small groups of affiliated rules that are unique to the nuns. One such group concerns protecting nuns from falling back into the worldly ways of a householder. The Vinaya has several examples of monks, and possibly even lay people, pressuring nuns to do what might be considered domestic chores, including \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np4/en/brahmali\#1.31.1}{Bu~NP~4} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np17/en/brahmali\#1.20.1}{Bu~NP~17}. Such pressure was no doubt more likely put on the nuns than on the monks. In other rules it is not clear whether the nuns were pressured or themselves chose to do such tasks. For instance, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc6/en/brahmali\#1.19.1}{Bi~Pc~6} prohibits a nun from doing certain services for a monk while he is eating, and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc43/en/brahmali\#1.14.1}{Bi~Pc~43} prohibits a nun from spinning yarn, whereas \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc44/en/brahmali\#1.11.1}{Bi~Pc~44} stops her from doing chores for householders. Finally, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc36/en/brahmali\#1.11.1}{Bi~Pc~36} bans a nun from improper socializing with men.

Another group of related rules forbids nuns from being verbally abusive. \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc19/en/brahmali\#1.17.1}{Bi~Pc~19} bars a nun from cursing herself or others. \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc52/en/brahmali\#1.29.1}{Bi~Pc~52} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc53/en/brahmali\#1.27.1}{53} stop a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} from abusing a monk and a community of nuns respectively. The first two of these are variations of \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc2/en/brahmali\#1.2.33.1}{Bu~Pc~2}/Bi Pc 98, whereas the last one, which according to the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga} concerns \textit{sanghakamma}, is essentially an elaboration on \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc79/en/brahmali\#1.22.1}{Bu~Pc~79}/Bi Pc 157 and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc81/en/brahmali\#1.16.1}{Bu~Pc~81}/Bi Pc 159, which forbid criticizing a properly performed \textit{sanghakamma}. It is interesting that the first of the three, Bi Pc 19, also prohibits self-harm, a prohibition taken further in \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc20/en/brahmali\#1.11.1}{Bi~Pc~20}, which prohibits a nun from beating herself and then crying. Self-harm may have been a significant issue in a society where women often experienced discrimination and violence.

Yet another group of rules was laid down to protect nuns from harm, including \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc21/en/brahmali\#1.16.1}{Bi~Pc~21}, which prohibits a nun from bathing naked, and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc37/en/brahmali\#1.12.1}{Bi~Pc~37} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc38/en/brahmali\#1.12.1}{38}, which prohibit traveling in dangerous places without company. The protection of nuns from harm is a recurring theme in the nuns’ rules, including in \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-ss3/en/brahmali\#1.1}{Bi~Ss~3} and in several minor rules in the Bhikkhuni-kkhandhaka.

Then there is a group of eight rules concerned with the proper conduct in relation to robes.\footnote{Bi Pc 23–29 and 47. } These rules focus on two main issues, treating one’s fellow nuns considerately and the proper looking after of one’s requisites. An important consideration in many of these is no doubt, once again, the difficulty nuns had in obtaining material support.

There is also a group of seven \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} concerned broadly with etiquette.\footnote{Bi Pc 8–9, 15–17, and 94–95. } Among these, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc15/en/brahmali\#1.19.1}{Bi~Pc~15}–17 concern rude behavior toward householders and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc94/en/brahmali\#1.11.1}{Bi~Pc~94}–95 are about inappropriate behavior toward monks. These latter two rules, together with \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc52/en/brahmali\#1.29.1}{Bi~Pc~52} discussed above, are a reminder of the gender hierarchy that existed in ancient India. Still, among the six schools mentioned earlier, Bi Pc 94 is only found in the Pali and the \textsanskrit{Sarvāstivāda} Vinaya,\footnote{\textsanskrit{Sarvāstivāda} \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{pācittiya}} 104. } whereas Bi Pc 52 is found neither in the \textsanskrit{Mahiśāsaka} nor the \textsanskrit{Mūlasarvāstivāda} Vinaya, suggesting that both of these rules are sectarian in origin, thus arguably not binding on \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}}. Moreover, the ruling at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc95/en/brahmali\#1.11.1}{Bi~Pc~95} that nuns must ask for permission before asking a question, which happens to be shared with four other schools,\footnote{The four are \textsanskrit{Mahiśāsaka} \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{pācittiya}} 186, Dharmaguptaka \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{pācittiya}} 172, \textsanskrit{Mūlasarvāstivāda} \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{pācittiya}} 169, and \textsanskrit{Sarvāstivāda} \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{pācittiya}} 158. } partly overlaps with a similar rule for the monks at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali\#15.6.3}{Kd~2:15.6.3}.

The remaining two rules in this group, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc8/en/brahmali\#1.26.1}{Bi~Pc~8} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc9/en/brahmali\#1.15.1}{9}, are concerned with the disposal of waste products. The origin story to the first of these is particularly entertaining. Early one morning a nun empties a chamber pot by throwing the contents over a wall, all of it landing on the head of a brahmin who happens to be on his way to work. In a fury, the brahmin decides to burn down the nuns’ residence. Just as he is about to enter the building with a firebrand, a lay supporter sees him. The brahmin tells him what has happened, upon which the lay supporter tells him how lucky he is to receive such a blessing from the nuns! The brahmin cools down and departs. Too good to be true, you say? Not when you know of the many bizarre things still happening in the Buddhist world. Finally, the last rule in this group, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc9/en/brahmali\#1.15.1}{Bi~Pc~9}, concerns spoiling a field with waste products. This rule is effectively no more than a slight expansion of \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-sk74/en/brahmali\#1.3.1}{Sk~74}.

Moving on to the next group, the nuns have three unique rules against excessive indulgence, that is, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc41/en/brahmali\#1.16.1}{Bi~Pc~41}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc88/en/brahmali\#1.14.1}{88}, and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc89/en/brahmali\#1.14.1}{89}, the first of which concerns the visiting of pleasure houses and parks, whereas the last two are about bathing in scented water. The problem of indulgence is an important theme throughout the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka}, and especially so in the Khandhakas.

There are a further four rules that regulate the important relationship between the nuns and the Bhikkhu-sangha: \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc51/en/brahmali\#3.9.1}{Bi~Pc~51}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc56/en/brahmali\#1.16.1}{56}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc58/en/brahmali\#1.14.1}{58}, and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc59/en/brahmali\#1.11.1}{59}. Bi Pc 58 and 59 require \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}} to ask for and take part in the half-monthly instruction, the \textit{\textsanskrit{ovāda}}, whereas Bi Pc 56 is a practical consequence of this, thus prohibiting a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} from spending the rainy season in a monastery without monks. In the early years of the Sangha, the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}} were the junior partners, both in terms of seniority and numbers, and it was therefore natural for the monks to support them with teachings. In the present day this is no longer always the case, as a result of which these rules may seem discriminatory. In practice, however, the nuns are often grateful for such teachings, especially if they come from a senior and well-respected member of the Bhikkhu-sangha.

Finally, there are eight remaining miscellaneous rules,\footnote{Bi Pc 18, 34, 40, 45, 48, 55, 60, and 96. } the majority of which concern inconsiderate conduct toward fellow nuns. Then there is \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc40/en/brahmali\#1.13.1}{Bi~Pc~40}, which requires the nuns to go wandering after the rainy season residence. The purpose of this rule, according to the origin story, is to ensure the nuns go out to meet lay supporters, a part of which would have been teaching engagements. It seems, then, that the nuns were encouraged from the very beginning to take an active part in inspiring faith and teaching the Dhamma. The last of the eight, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc96/en/brahmali\#1.16.1}{Bi~Pc~96}, requires a nun to wear a “chest wrap”, a \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅkaccikā}}, when entering an inhabited area. This cloth is a special robe worn only by \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}}. Its purpose is to protect a nun’s modesty, especially among lay people.

\section*{Once again, why do the nuns have more rules than the monks?}

Having surveyed the content of the \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī}-\textsanskrit{vibhaṅga}, we are now in a position to return to this unavoidable question. As we have seen, the main reason for the discrepancy is that the nuns inherited a large number of rules from the monks, but not vice versa. This continued into the sectarian period, with the nuns inheriting all the \textit{sekhiyas} that were laid down at this time. (See introduction to volume 1.) Altogether they inherited 181 rules, leaving only 46 unique rules for the monks, compared to 130 for the nuns. In addition, the nuns’ \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} rules were added to long after the monks’ \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiyas}} were fixed. These two reasons probably account for most of the difference in the number of rules, perhaps even all of it. Still, we are now in a position to look more closely at other contributing factors.

To begin with, the nuns sometimes have several rules where the monks only have one. For instance, the nuns have eight \textit{\textsanskrit{pāṭidesanīya}} rules, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pd1/en/brahmali\#1.2.9.1}{Bi~Pd~1}–8, which together correspond to a single rule for the monks, that is, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39/en/brahmali\#2.10.1}{Bu~Pc~39}. Similarly, the nuns have nine \textit{nissaggiya \textsanskrit{pācittiya}} rules, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-np4/en/brahmali\#1.27.1}{Bi~NP~4}–12, that are effectively reducible to the shared rule on bartering, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np20/en/brahmali\#1.35.1}{Bu~NP~20}/Bi NP 23.\footnote{It is not clear to me why the nuns have these extra rules when they seem to be covered by \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np20/en/brahmali\#1.35.1}{Bu~NP~20}/Bi NP 23. } This means that the nuns have 17 rules that are collectively covered by two rules in the Bhikkhu-\textsanskrit{pātimokkha}. And so, none of these is truly unique.

Second, we have seen above that 36 of the nuns’ unique \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} rules are also rules for the monks, but elsewhere in the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka}, often in the Khandhakas. There are another three such rules among the nuns’ \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghādisesas}} and \textit{nissaggiya \textsanskrit{pācittiyas}}, adding up to 39.

\end{enumerate}

In fact, it is hard to give a precise number of such rules because sometimes the equivalence is not exact. Arguably there are even more such rules. Nonetheless, adding the 17 rules from above, we have 56 unique nuns’ rules that turn out not to be truly unique after all. Instead of 130 unique rules for the nuns, we are down to 74. On top of this, it is reasonable to regard some of the large number of nuns’ rules concerned with ordination as an elaboration on \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65/en/brahmali\#1.53.1}{Bu~Pc~65},\footnote{Especially \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc63/en/brahmali\#1.41.1}{Bi~Pc~63}–67 and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc71/en/brahmali\#1.17.1}{Bi~Pc~71}–73, altogether eight rules being roughly equivalent to the monks’ \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65/en/brahmali\#1.53.1}{Bu~Pc~65}. } which brings us down to perhaps 66 rules for the nuns that are unique in a meaningful sense.

These findings substantially change our picture of the difference in the number of rules between the two Sanghas. Given that the monks effectively have 39 unique rules and the nuns 66,\footnote{I have reduced the number of unique monks’ rules from the 46 given earlier to 39, because seven of them are mentioned in the footnote on 39 equivalents as being effective equivalents to certain \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} rules. These are \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss1/en/brahmali\#2.1.13.1}{Bu~Ss~1}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np21/en/brahmali\#2.17.1}{Bu~NP~21}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35/en/brahmali\#2.15.1}{Bu~Pc~35}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc39/en/brahmali\#2.10.1}{Bu~Pc~39}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc41/en/brahmali\#1.2.15.1}{Bu~Pc~41}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc65/en/brahmali\#1.53.1}{Bu~Pc~65} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc91/en/brahmali\#1.14.1}{Bu~Pc~91}. } the difference is down from 84 to 27. Suddenly the difference seems less of a problem, amounting as it does to less than 10% of the nuns’ overall number of \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} rules. Such a relatively small difference might just be a result of the contingencies of history. It does not define the nuns’ \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha} as fundamentally different from that of the monks.

Yet, even this is not the complete picture. We need to return to the fact that many of the nuns’ \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} rules evidently were laid down in the sectarian period, which means they are arguably not binding on the nuns.\footnote{This is, in fact, also true of the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī} nissaggiya \textsanskrit{pācittiya}} rules. There are considerable variations between the different schools in the rules that correspond to the Theravadin \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-np4/en/brahmali\#1.27.1}{Bi~NP~4}–10. However, I have already discounted these rules as roughly equivalent to \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-np20/en/brahmali\#1.35.1}{Bu~NP~20}/Bi NP 23. I cannot discount the same rules a second time. } Using the comparative tables provided by SuttaCentral,\footnote{See https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc, and click the parallels button for each rule. } we find that a large number of \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} rules are not shared by all the six schools. If we take the standard that any rule not shared by all schools is sectarian, that is, not stemming from the earliest period of Buddhism, we discover that this is so for 31 of the 66 remaining rules.\footnote{Taking the Pali Vinaya as a baseline and using the Theravada numbering system, the 31 unique \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}} rules that are missing from one or more of the other schools are as follows: Bi Pc 15, 21, 23–27, 29–30, 34, 36, 41, 43, 45, 47–48, 51–53, 56, 61–62, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 89, 94–96. } This means that only 35 unique nuns’ rules may reasonably be considered as non-sectarian, compared to 39 for the monks.\footnote{The 35 are the following: Bi Pj 5–8; Bi Ss 1, 3–6, and 10–13; Bi NP 2; Bi Pc 6, 8–9, 16–20, 28, 37–38, 40, 44, 55, 58–60, 70, 78, 82, and 88. } We have arrived at virtual parity.

Although this is a remarkable result, we need to keep in mind that this is no more than a rough estimate. The uncertainties are especially pronounced in the number of rules that are likely to be sectarian. Nevertheless, this is a much more plausible picture than any direct comparison between the number of rules in the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkhas} of the two Sanghas.

We arrive at a rather unexpected and welcome conclusion. When we exclude any rules that we can infer were not laid down by the Buddha, the number of rules that is truly mandatory for the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}} is essentially the same as for the monks.\footnote{As to the related question of whether the nuns’ rules are generally more stringent than those of the monks, see the discussion in the section on the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{pārājika}} offenses above. }

\subsection*{Origin story }

\scnamo{Homage to the Buddha, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery,\footnote{The numbering begins with five because the first four rules have been omitted. This is because these rules are almost identical to the rules entailing expulsion for the monks, the only difference being the first rule, which is worded slightly differently. } \textsanskrit{Migāra}’s grandson \textsanskrit{Sāḷha} wanted to build a dwelling for the Sangha of nuns. He went to the nuns and said, “Venerables, I wish to build a dwelling for the Sangha of nuns. Please get me the nun in charge of building work.” 

At\marginnote{1.6} that time four sisters had gone forth as nuns: \textsanskrit{Nandā}, \textsanskrit{Nandavatī}, \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā}, and \textsanskrit{Thullanandā}. Of these, the nun \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā} had gone forth when she was young, and she was beautiful, intelligent, skilled, and diligent, and she possessed good judgment in regard to doing and arranging things well. After appointing \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā} to be in charge of building work, the Sangha made her work with \textsanskrit{Sāḷha}. As a consequence of this, \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā} would often go to \textsanskrit{Sāḷha}’s house to ask for tools, whether an adz, a hatchet, an ax, a spade, or a chisel. And \textsanskrit{Sāḷha} would often go to the nuns’ dwelling place to find out about the progress of the building work. And because they saw each other frequently, they fell in love. 

But\marginnote{1.14} because \textsanskrit{Sāḷha} could not find any opportunity to be intimate with \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā}, he invited the Sangha of nuns for a meal. When preparing the seats in the dining hall, he counted the number of nuns senior to Venerable \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā} and placed their seats to one side, and he counted the number of nuns junior to her and placed their seats on the other side. He then placed \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā}’s seat in a concealed spot in a corner. In this way the senior nuns would think she was seated close to the junior ones and the junior nuns would think she was seated close to the senior ones. Soon afterwards he informed the Sangha that the meal was ready. 

\textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā}\marginnote{1.18} thought, “\textsanskrit{Sāḷha} hasn’t prepared a meal for the Sangha as a service, but because he wants to be intimate with me. If I go, I will get into trouble.” She then told a nun who was her pupil, “Go and bring back almsfood for me. If anyone asks about me, tell them I’m sick.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.21} Venerable,” she replied. 

Soon\marginnote{1.22} afterwards \textsanskrit{Sāḷha} was standing outside his gatehouse repeatedly inquiring after \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā}:\footnote{For a discussion of the rendering “gatehouse” for \textit{\textsanskrit{koṭṭhaka}}, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } “Venerables, where’s Venerable \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā}?” The nun who was \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā}’s pupil told him: “She’s sick. I’m bringing her almsfood.” \textsanskrit{Sāḷha} thought, “I invited the Sangha of nuns because of \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā},” and after telling the people there to serve the meal to the Sangha of nuns, he left for the nuns’ dwelling place. 

Just\marginnote{1.27} then \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā} was standing outside the monastery gatehouse longing for \textsanskrit{Sāḷha}. When she saw him coming, she entered the dwelling, put on her upper robe so that it covered her head, and lay down on her bed. \textsanskrit{Sāḷha} approached her and said, “Venerable, what’s wrong with you? Why are you lying down?” 

“That’s\marginnote{1.30} what happens when you desire someone who doesn’t desire you in return.” 

“What\marginnote{1.31} do you mean I don’t desire you? I just couldn’t find an opportunity to be intimate with you.”\footnote{“Intimate with” renders \textit{\textsanskrit{dūsetuṁ}}. For a discussion of the meaning of \textit{\textsanskrit{dūseti}}, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } And both having lust, he made physical contact with \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā}. 

Just\marginnote{1.34} then a nun who was weak from old age and had problems with her feet was lying down not far from \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā}. She saw how \textsanskrit{Sāḷha} made physical contact with \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā} while both of them had lust. She complained and criticized her, “How could Venerable \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā} consent to a man making physical contact with her, when they both had lust?” That nun then told the nuns what had happened. The nuns of few desires, who had a sense of conscience, and who were contented, afraid of wrongdoing, and fond of the training, complained and criticized her, “How could Venerable \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā} consent to a man making physical contact with her, when they both had lust?” Those nuns then told the monks. And the monks of few desires, who had a sense of conscience, and who were contented, afraid of wrongdoing, and fond of the training, criticized her in the same way. 

After\marginnote{1.41} rebuking the nun \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā} in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the nun \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā} acted like this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.44} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.45} Buddha rebuked her, “It’s not suitable, monks, it’s not proper for the nun \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā}, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā} consent to a man making physical contact with her, when they both had lust? This will affect people’s confidence, and cause some to lose it.” And the Buddha spoke in many ways in dispraise of being difficult to support and maintain, in dispraise of great desires, discontent, socializing, and laziness; but he spoke in many ways in praise of being easy to support and maintain, of fewness of wishes, contentment, self-effacement, ascetic practices, serenity, reduction in things, and being energetic. After giving a teaching on what is right and proper, he addressed the monks: 

“Well\marginnote{1.51} then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons: for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad nuns, for the ease of good nuns, for the restraint of the corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of the corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training.\footnote{“Training” renders \textit{vinaya}. For a discussion of this word, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } 

And,\marginnote{1.53} monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a lustful nun consents to a lustful man making physical contact with her, to touching her, to taking hold of her, to contacting her, or to squeezing her, anywhere below the collar bone but above the knees, she too is expelled and excluded from the community. The training rule on above the knees.’”\footnote{For a detailed discussion of this rule, see Appendix on Individual \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī} Rules. } }

\subsection*{Permutations }

\subparagraph*{Both having lust: contact below the collar bone but above the knees }

If\marginnote{2.2.1} both have lust and either of them makes physical contact, below the collar bone but above the knees, body to body, she commits an offense entailing expulsion. If either of them, with their own body, makes physical contact with something connected to the other’s body, she commits a serious offense.\footnote{Something connected to the body means any contact that is not skin to skin, such as contact through clothes. That touching through clothes does not count as touching body to body is supported by two of the Vinayas in Chinese translation, namely, the Dharmaguptaska Vinaya and the \textsanskrit{Sarvāstivāda} Vinaya. } If either of them, with something connected to their own body, makes physical contact with the other’s body, she commits a serious offense. If either of them, with something connected to their own body, makes physical contact with something connected to the other’s body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 

If\marginnote{2.2.5} either of them, with something released by them, makes physical contact with the other’s body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If either of them, with something released by them, makes physical contact with something connected to the other’s body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.

If either of them, with something connected to their own body, makes physical contact with the other’s body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If either of them, with something connected to their own body, makes physical contact with something connected to the other’s body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 

If\marginnote{2.2.12} either of them, with something released by them, makes physical contact with the other’s body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If either of them, with something released by them, makes physical contact with something connected to the other’s body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If either of them, with something released by them, makes physical contact with something released by the other, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 

\subparagraph*{Only the nun having lust: contact below the collar bone but above the knees }

If\marginnote{2.2.15.1} only the nun has lust and either of them makes physical contact, below the collar bone but above the knees, body to body, she commits a serious offense.\footnote{The Pali just says that, “One of them has lust”, \textit{ekatoavassute}, without specifying who. However, it seems reasonable that this should refer to the nun, since it is hard to imagine she would incur an offense if her mind were pure. This supposition is supported by Sp 2.662: \textit{Ekatoavassuteti ettha \textsanskrit{kiñcāpi} ekatoti avisesena \textsanskrit{vuttaṁ}, \textsanskrit{tathāpi} \textsanskrit{bhikkhuniyā} eva avassute sati \textsanskrit{ayaṁ} \textsanskrit{āpattibhedo} vuttoti veditabbo}, “‘One of them has lust’: here, although it is said ‘one of them’ without distinction, still it is to be understood that this offense is said to be incurred only when the nun has lust.” } If either of them, with their own body, makes physical contact with something connected to the other’s body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If either of them, with something connected to their own body, makes physical contact with the other’s body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If either of them, with something connected to their own body, makes physical contact with something connected to the other’s body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 

If\marginnote{2.2.19} either of them, with something released by them, makes physical contact with the other’s body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If either of them, with something released by them, makes physical contact with something connected to the other’s body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If either of them, with something released by them, makes physical contact with something released by the other, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 

\subparagraph*{Only the nun having lust: contact above the collar bone or below the knees }

If\marginnote{2.2.22.1} either of them makes physical contact, above the collar bone or below the knees, body to body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.

If either of them, with something connected to their own body, makes physical contact with the other’s body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If either of them, with something connected to their own body, makes physical contact with something connected to the other’s body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.

If either of them, with something released by them, makes physical contact with something released by the other, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 

\subparagraph*{Both having lust: contact with other beings below the collar bone but above the knees }

If\marginnote{2.2.29.1} both have lust and she makes physical contact with a spirit, a ghost, a \textit{\textsanskrit{paṇḍaka}}, or an animal in human form, below the collar bone but above the knees, body to body, she commits a serious offense.\footnote{In this case, it seems implied by the genitive case ending for the various kinds of beings that it is only the nun who is making the contact. That the being in question is male is implied by the fact that there is no offense for touching a female human being. For a discussion of \textit{\textsanskrit{paṇḍaka}}, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } If she, with her own body, makes physical contact with something connected to their body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If she, with something connected to her own body, makes physical contact with their body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If she, with something connected to her own body, makes physical contact with something connected to their body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 

If\marginnote{2.2.33} she, with something released by her, makes physical contact with their body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If she, with something released by her, makes physical contact with something connected to their body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If she, with something released by her, makes physical contact with something released by them, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 

\subparagraph*{Both having lust: contact with other beings above the collar bone or below the knees }

If\marginnote{2.2.36.1} she makes physical contact with them, above the collar bone or below the knees, body to body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.

If\marginnote{2.2.40} she, with something released by her, makes physical contact with their body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If she, with something released by her, makes physical contact with something connected to their body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If she, with something released by her, makes physical contact with something released by them, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 

\subparagraph*{Only the nun having lust: contact with other beings below the collar bone but above the knees }

If\marginnote{2.2.43.1} only the nun has lust and she makes physical contact with them, below the collar bone but above the knees, body to body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If she, with her own body, makes physical contact with something connected to their body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If she, with something connected to her own body, makes physical contact with their body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If she, with something connected to her own body, makes physical contact with something connected to their body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 

If\marginnote{2.2.47} she, with something released by her, makes physical contact with their body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If she, with something released by her, makes physical contact with something connected to their body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If she, with something released by her, makes physical contact with something released by them, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 

\subparagraph*{Only the nun having lust: contact with other beings above the collar bone or below the knees }

If she, with something released by her, makes physical contact with something connected to their body, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time the nun \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā} was pregnant by \textsanskrit{Migāra}’s grandson \textsanskrit{Sāḷha}. When the fetus got large, she concealed her condition. And when the fetus was fully grown, she disrobed and gave birth. 

The\marginnote{1.5} nuns said to the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā}, “Venerable, \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā} gave birth shortly after disrobing.” “Could it be that she was pregnant while she was still a nun?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.8} Venerables.” 

“But,\marginnote{1.9} Venerable, when you knew that a nun had committed an offense entailing expulsion, why didn’t you either confront her yourself or tell the community?”\footnote{“Confront” renders \textit{\textsanskrit{paṭicodesi}}. For a discussion of the closely related term \textit{codeti}, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } 

“Her\marginnote{1.10} disrepute is my disrepute, her infamy is my infamy, her notoriety is my notoriety, her loss is my loss. Why would I tell others of my own disrepute, infamy, notoriety, and loss?” 

The\marginnote{1.12} nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, “How could Venerable \textsanskrit{Thullanandā}, knowing that a nun had committed an offense entailing expulsion, neither confront her herself nor tell the community?” 

Then\marginnote{1.14} those nuns told the monks what had happened, and the monks in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} acted like this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.18} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.19} Buddha rebuked her … “How could the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā}, knowing that a nun had committed an offense entailing expulsion, neither confront her herself nor tell the community? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a nun knows that a nun has committed an offense entailing expulsion, but she neither confronts her herself nor tells the community, and afterward—whether that nun remains or has died or has been expelled or has converted—she says, “Venerables, although I previously knew that this nun was like this, I thought, ‘I will neither confront her myself nor tell the community,’” she too is expelled and excluded from the community.

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} was taking sides with the monk \textsanskrit{Ariṭṭha}, an ex-vulture-killer, who had been ejected by a unanimous Sangha. 

The\marginnote{1.3} nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, “How can Venerable \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} take sides with the monk \textsanskrit{Ariṭṭha} who has been ejected by a unanimous Sangha?” … “Is it true, monks, that the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} is doing this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.6} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.7} Buddha rebuked her … “How can the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} take sides with the monk \textsanskrit{Ariṭṭha} who has been ejected by a unanimous Sangha? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:

Venerables,\marginnote{0.5} these seventeen rules on suspension come up for recitation. 

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. At that time a lay follower who had given a storehouse to the Sangha of nuns had died. He had two sons, one with and one without faith and confidence, and they divided their father’s property between them. Then the one without faith said to the other, “The storehouse is ours; let’s allocate it to one of us.” But the one with faith responded, “No, our father gave it to the Sangha of nuns.” 

A\marginnote{1.11} second time they both said the same thing, and a third time the one without faith repeated his proposal. The one with faith then thought, “If I get it, I too would give it to the Sangha of nuns,” and he said, “Alright, let’s allocate it.” 

But\marginnote{1.22} when they allocated it, it fell to the one without faith. He then went to the nuns and said, “Please leave, Venerables, this storehouse is mine.” 

The\marginnote{1.25} nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} said to him, “No, your father gave it to the Sangha of nuns.” 

Because\marginnote{1.27} they were unable to agree, they asked judges to decide on the matter. They said, “Venerable, who knows that it was given to the Sangha of nuns?” \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} replied, “But Sirs, didn’t you appoint a witness who saw or heard the giving of the gift?” Saying, “It’s true what the Venerable says,” the judges made the storehouse the property of the Sangha of nuns. 

The\marginnote{1.34} defeated man complained and criticized the nuns, “They’re not monastics these shaven-headed sluts. How could they take my storehouse?” \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} told the judges of this and they punished him. That man then made a dwelling place for \textsanskrit{Ājīvaka} ascetics not far from the nuns, inciting them to abuse the nuns. 

Once\marginnote{1.41} again \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} told the judges and the judges jailed him. People then complained and criticized those nuns, “First the nuns take his storehouse, then they have him punished, and then they have him jailed. Next they’ll have him executed!” 

Nuns\marginnote{1.46} heard the complaints of those people, and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, “How could Venerable \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} take legal action?” 

Then\marginnote{1.49} those nuns told the monks … “Is it true, monks, that the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} is taking legal action?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.51} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.52} Buddha rebuked her … “How could the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} take legal action? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a nun takes legal action against a householder or a householder’s offspring or a slave or a worker or even toward a monastic or a wanderer, then that nun has committed an immediate offense entailing sending away and suspension.’” }

\begin{description}%
\item[A: ] whoever … %
\item[Nun: ] … The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case. %
\item[Takes legal action: ] what is meant is that she is the initiator of a lawsuit. %
\item[A householder: ] anyone who lives at home.\footnote{\textit{\textsanskrit{Agāraṁ}} is typically rendered as “in a house”. The problem with this is that it is not unallowable for a monastic to live in a building that is the equivalent of a house. What a monastic should not do is own a home and then live there. } %
\item[A householder’s offspring: ] whoever is an offspring or a sibling.\footnote{“Offspring” renders \textit{putta/\textsanskrit{ā}}, whereas “sibling” renders \textit{\textsanskrit{bhātaro}}. In Pali the male gender takes precedent if a group contains people of both sexes. For instance, the plural \textit{\textsanskrit{puttā}}, “sons”, may mean “children” or “offsping”, depending on the context. In the same way, the plural \textit{\textsanskrit{bhātāro}}, “brothers”, can mean “siblings”. This way of understanding male-gender nouns is confirmed in the introduction to the Pali lexical work the \textsanskrit{Abhidhānappadīpikāṭīkā}: \textit{Ettha hi \textsanskrit{mātā} ca \textsanskrit{pitā} ca pitaro, putto ca \textsanskrit{dhītā} ca \textsanskrit{puttā}, sassu ca sasuro ca \textsanskrit{sasurā}, \textsanskrit{bhātā} ca \textsanskrit{bhaginī} ca \textsanskrit{bhātaroti} \textsanskrit{bhinnaliṅgānampi} ekaseso dassitoti}, “Mother and father are fathers; son and daughter are sons; mother-in-law and father-in-law are fathers-in-law; brother and sister are brothers;’ in this case the split gender is shown with only one gender remaining.” The \textsanskrit{Abhidhānappadīpikāṭīkā} is available online at tipitaka.org. } %
\item[A slave: ] one born in the household, one who has been bought, one who has been brought back as a captive. %
\item[A worker: ] a paid worker, a servant. %
\item[A monastic or a wanderer: ] anyone who is a wanderer apart from Buddhist monks, nuns, trainee nuns, novice monks, and novice nuns. If, thinking, “I’ll initiate a lawsuit,” she looks for a companion or just goes there herself, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If she tells one other person, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If she tells a second person, she commits a serious offense. At the end of the lawsuit, she commits an offense entailing suspension. %
\item[An immediate offense: ] there is an offense as soon as the misconduct is committed, and no pressing is required. %
\item[Entailing sending away: ] she is sent away from the Sangha. %
\item[Suspension: ] only the Sangha gives the trial period for that offense, sends back to the beginning, and rehabilitates—not several nuns, not an individual nun.

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time in \textsanskrit{Vesālī} the wife of a certain \textsanskrit{Licchavī} man was unfaithful. He said to her, “Please stop. If you don’t, I’ll punish you.” But she did not listen. 

Just\marginnote{1.6} then in \textsanskrit{Vesālī} the \textsanskrit{Licchavī} clan had gathered on some business. That \textsanskrit{Licchavī} man said to them, “Sirs, please give me permission in regard to one of my wives.” 

“What\marginnote{1.9} is it with her?” 

“She’s\marginnote{1.10} unfaithful. I wish to kill her.” 

“You\marginnote{1.11} may go ahead.”\footnote{\textit{\textsanskrit{Jānāhi}}, literally, “You know.” The implied meaning is not clear. However, in commenting on a different passage, one of the sub-commentaries, Sp-\textsanskrit{ṭ} 4.330, defines the word as follows: \textit{\textsanskrit{Jānāhīti} cettha \textsanskrit{paṭipajjāti} attho veditabbo}, “And here the meaning of ‘you know’ is to be understood as ‘you undertake’.” } 

When\marginnote{1.12} his wife heard that her husband wanted to kill her, she took their most valuable possessions and went to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. There she went to the monastics of other religions and asked for the going forth, but they refused. She then went to the Buddhist nuns and again asked for the going forth, but they too refused. She then went to the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā}, showed her the goods, and once again asked for the going forth. \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} took the goods and gave her the going forth. 

That\marginnote{1.20} \textsanskrit{Licchavī} man then went to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in search of his wife. When he saw that she had been given the going forth as a nun, he went to King Pasenadi of Kosala and said, “Sir, my wife took my most valuable possessions and came to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. Please permit me to deal with her.” 

“Well\marginnote{1.24} then, find her and then inform me.” 

“I’ve\marginnote{1.25} seen her. She’s gone forth as a nun.” 

“If\marginnote{1.26} she’s gone forth as a nun, there’s nothing that can be done. The Teaching of the Buddha is well-proclaimed. Let her practice the spiritual life for the full ending of suffering.” 

Then\marginnote{1.28} that \textsanskrit{Licchavī} man complained and criticized the nuns, “How could the nuns give the going forth to a criminal?” 

The\marginnote{1.30} nuns heard the complaints of that \textsanskrit{Licchavī} man, and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, “How could Venerable \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} give the going forth to a criminal?” The nuns told the monks. … “Is it true, monks, that the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.35} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.36} Buddha rebuked her … “How could the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} give the going forth to a criminal? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a nun, without getting permission from the king or the Sangha or a community or an association or a society, knowingly gives the full admission to a female criminal who is known as sentenced to death, then, except when it is allowable, that nun too has committed an immediate offense entailing sending away and suspension.’” }

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, a nun who was a pupil of \textsanskrit{Bhaddā} \textsanskrit{Kāpilānī} had an argument with the nuns and then went to her relatives’ village. Not seeing her pupil anywhere, \textsanskrit{Bhaddā} \textsanskrit{Kāpilānī} asked the nuns, “Where’s so-and-so? She’s disappeared.” 

“She\marginnote{1.4} disappeared, Venerable, after arguing with the nuns.” 

“My\marginnote{1.5} dears, her relatives live in such-and-such a village. Go there and look for her.” 

The\marginnote{1.6} nuns went there, and when they saw her, they said to her, “Why did you go alone, Venerable? We hope you weren’t assaulted?” 

“I\marginnote{1.7} wasn’t.” 

The\marginnote{1.8} nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, “How could a nun walk to the next village by herself?” … “Is it true, monks, that a nun did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.11} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.12} Buddha rebuked her … “How could a nun do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 

\subsubsection*{First preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a nun walks to the next inhabited area by herself, then that nun too has committed an immediate offense entailing sending away and suspension.’” }

In\marginnote{1.17} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the nuns. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

On\marginnote{2.1} one occasion two nuns were traveling from \textsanskrit{Sāketa} to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. On the way they had to cross a river. They went to a boatman and said, “Please take us across.” 

“I’m\marginnote{2.4} not able, Venerables, to take both of you across at the same time.” And so they crossed individually, alone with the boatman. When he had crossed with the first nun, he raped her.\footnote{“Raped” renders \textit{\textsanskrit{dūsesi}}. For a discussion of this word, see Appendix of Technical Terms. } And after returning to the first bank, he raped the other nun as well. Later, when they were reunited, they asked each other, “Venerable, I hope you weren’t assaulted?” 

“I\marginnote{2.10} was. And you, Venerable, were you assaulted?” 

“I\marginnote{2.12} was, too.” 

They\marginnote{2.13} then continued on to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} and told the nuns there what had happened. The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them, “How could a nun cross a river by herself?” They told the monks, who in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that a nun did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{2.19} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{2.20} Buddha rebuked them … “How could a nun do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 

\subsubsection*{Second preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a nun walks to the next inhabited area by herself or crosses a river by herself, then that nun too has committed an immediate offense entailing sending away and suspension.’” }

In\marginnote{2.25} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the nuns. 

\subsubsection*{Third sub-story }

On\marginnote{3.1} one occasion a number of nuns were walking through the Kosalan country on their way to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}, when one evening they arrived at a certain village. One of the nuns was beautiful and graceful, and a certain man fell in love with her as soon as he saw her. Then, as he was preparing sleeping places for those nuns, he prepared hers to one side. And that nun thought, “This man is obsessed with me. If I go there for the night, I’ll get into trouble.” Then, without informing the nuns, she went to a certain family and slept there. 

When\marginnote{3.6} night arrived, that man went searching for that nun, and as he did so he bumped into the other nuns. Not seeing that nun anywhere, the nuns said, “No doubt she has left with a man.” 

The\marginnote{3.8} following morning that nun returned to the nuns, and they said to her, “Venerable, why did you leave with a man?” 

“I\marginnote{3.9} didn’t leave with a man, Venerables.” 

She\marginnote{3.10} then told the nuns what had happened. The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, “How could a nun spend the night apart by herself?” … “Is it true, monks, that a nun did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{3.14} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{3.15} Buddha rebuked her … “How could a nun do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 

\subsubsection*{Third preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a nun walks to the next inhabited area by herself or crosses a river by herself or spends the night apart by herself, then that nun too has committed an immediate offense entailing sending away and suspension.’” }

In\marginnote{3.20} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the nuns. 

\subsubsection*{Fourth sub-story }

On\marginnote{4.1} one occasion a number of nuns were traveling through the Kosalan country on their way to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. One of the nuns, needing to defecate, stayed behind by herself, and then followed behind the others. People saw her and raped her. She then went to the other nuns, and they said to her, “Why did you stay behind by yourself, Venerable? We hope you weren’t assaulted?” 

“I\marginnote{4.5} was.” 

The\marginnote{4.6} nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, “How could a nun lag behind her companions by herself?” … “Is it true, monks, that a nun did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{4.9} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{4.10} Buddha rebuked her … “How could a nun do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time the nun \textsanskrit{Caṇḍakāḷī} was quarrelsome and argumentative, and she created legal issues in the Sangha. But when a legal procedure was being done against her, the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} objected. 

Soon\marginnote{1.4} afterwards \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} went to a village on some business. The Sangha of nuns took the opportunity to eject \textsanskrit{Caṇḍakāḷī} for not recognizing an offense. When \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} had finished her business in that village, she returned to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. On her return, \textsanskrit{Caṇḍakāḷī} neither prepared a seat for her, nor set out a foot stool, a foot scraper, or water for washing the feet; and she did not go out to meet her to receive her bowl and robe, nor ask whether she wanted water to drink. \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} asked her why she was acting like this. She replied, “That’s how it is, Venerable, when you don’t have a protector.” 

“But\marginnote{1.12} how is it, Venerable, that you don’t have a protector?” 

“When\marginnote{1.13} the nuns knew that no one would speak up for me because I am not esteemed by them and I didn’t have a protector, they ejected me for not recognizing an offense.” 

“They\marginnote{1.15} are incompetent fools. They don’t know about legal procedures or their flaws, nor what makes them fail or succeed. But we know all these things. We can get legal procedures done that haven’t been done, and we can get procedures that have been done overturned.” And she quickly gathered a sangha of nuns and readmitted the nun \textsanskrit{Caṇḍakāḷī}. 

The\marginnote{1.19} nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, “How could Venerable \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} readmit a nun who had been ejected by a unanimous Sangha in accordance with the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction, without first getting permission from the Sangha that did the legal procedure and without the consent of the community?” … “Is it true, monks, that the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.22} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.23} Buddha rebuked her … “How could the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} readmit a nun who had been ejected by a unanimous Sangha in accordance with the Teaching, the Monastic Law, and the Teacher’s instruction, without first getting permission from the Sangha that did the legal procedure and without the consent of the community?

In this rule, however, the non-offense clause specifically says that there is no offense if the nun knows that the man does not have lust, and so the state of mind of the nun does not seem to be an issue.

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time there was a beautiful nun called \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā}. When people saw her in the dining hall, they were affected by lust, and they gave her the best food. Being afraid of wrongdoing, \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā} did not receive it. The nun next to her said, “Why didn’t you receive it, Venerable?” 

“Because\marginnote{1.7} they have lust.” 

“But\marginnote{1.8} do you have lust?” 

“No.”\marginnote{1.9} 

“What\marginnote{1.10} can this man do to you, whether he has lust or not, when you’re without it? Go on, Venerable, receive it with your own hands, and eat whatever fresh or cooked food he gives you.” 

The\marginnote{1.12} nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, “How could a nun say, ‘What can this man do to you, whether he has lust or not, when you’re without it? Go on, Venerable, receive it with your own hands, and eat whatever fresh or cooked food he gives you’?” … “Is it true, monks, that a nun said this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.19} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.20} Buddha rebuked her … “How could a nun say this?” This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} had been pressed by the Sangha. She then said to the nuns, “Venerables, you should socialize. Don’t live separately. There are other nuns in the Sangha who have such behavior, reputation, and notoriety,  and who harass the Sangha of nuns and hide each other’s offenses. The Sangha says nothing to them. It’s because of disrespect, contempt, impatience, and slander, and because you are weak that the Sangha says to you, ‘Sisters, you socialize, behave badly, have a bad reputation, are notorious, harass the Sangha of nuns, and hide each other’s offenses. Be secluded, Venerables. The Sangha praises seclusion for the Sisters.’”\footnote{In the sequence \textit{\textsanskrit{uññāya} paribhavena \textsanskrit{akkhantiyā} \textsanskrit{vebhassiyā} \textsanskrit{dubbalyā}} every word seems to be in the instrumental case except \textit{\textsanskrit{dubbalyā}}, which presumably is an ablative. This is unusual. The commentary, at Sp 2.727, says: \textit{\textsanskrit{Dubbalyāti} \textsanskrit{tumhākaṁ} \textsanskrit{dubbalabhāvena}}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{Dubbalyā}}: because of your weakness.” This implies that \textit{\textsanskrit{dubbalyā}} is the only word in the sequence that does not refer to the Sangha, but rather to the misbehaving nuns, which would be odd. Yet the commentarial interpretation is supported by the word commentary below, which defines \textit{\textsanskrit{dubbalyā}} as \textit{\textsanskrit{apakkhatā}} , “because of lack of supporters”. I therefore feel compelled to follow the commentarial interpretation. } 

The\marginnote{1.6} nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, “How could Venerable \textsanskrit{Thullanandā}, after being pressed by the Sangha, say this to the nuns?” … “Is it true, monks, that after being pressed by the Sangha, the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} said this to the nuns?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.15} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.16} Buddha rebuked her … “How could the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā}, after being pressed by the Sangha, say this to the nuns? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a nun says, “Venerables, you should socialize. Don’t live separately.

It’s because of disrespect, contempt, impatience, and slander, and because you are weak that the Sangha says to you, ‘Sisters, you socialize, behave badly, have a bad reputation, are notorious, harass the Sangha of nuns, and hide each other’s offenses.

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time, after completing the rainy-season residence in a village monastery, a number of nuns were traveling to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. They were perfect in conduct and deportment, but poorly dressed in shabby robes. Some lay followers who saw them thought, “These nuns are perfect in conduct and deportment, but poorly dressed in shabby robes; they must’ve been robbed,” and they gave out-of-season robe-cloth to the Sangha of nuns. Because they had performed the robe-making ceremony, the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} determined it as in-season robe-cloth, and then distributed it. The lay followers asked those nuns whether they had obtained any robe-cloth. They replied that they hadn’t and told them what had happened.\footnote{The point here is that because \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} (illegitimately) determines the robe-cloth as in-season, it can only be distributed to those nuns who have spent the rainy season in the monastery where the robe-cloth is given. The traveling nuns were therefore excluded from receiving it. } Those lay followers then complained and criticized her, “How could Venerable \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} determine out-of-season robe-cloth as ‘in-season’, and then distribute it?” 

The\marginnote{1.14} nuns heard the complaints of those lay followers, and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, “How could Venerable \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} do this?” Those nuns then told the monks, who in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.20} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.21} Buddha rebuked her … “How could the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} was using a robe she had received after trading with another nun. But the other nun folded up the robe she had received and put it aside. \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} then said to her, “Venerable, where’s that robe that I traded with you?” She brought out the robe and showed it to her, and \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} said, “Here’s your robe and give me that robe of mine. That which is yours is yours and that which is mine is mine. Give me that and take back what’s yours.” And she just took it. 

That\marginnote{1.9} nun then told the nuns what had happened. The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, “How could Venerable \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} trade a robe with a nun and then take it back?” Those nuns then told the monks, who in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.15} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.16} Buddha rebuked her … “How could the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} trade a robe with a nun and then take it back? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} was a learned reciter, and she was confident and skilled at giving teachings. On one occasion when the weather was warm, King Pasenadi of Kosala put on an expensive linen cloak and went to \textsanskrit{Thullanandā}. He bowed and sat down. And \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching. He then said, “Venerable, please say what you need.” 

“Great\marginnote{1.7} king, if you wish to give me something, then give me this linen cloak.” 

The\marginnote{1.8} king gave her his cloak. He then got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated her with his right side toward her, and left. People complained and criticized her, “These nuns have great desires; they are not content. How can they ask the king for his linen cloak?” 

The\marginnote{1.12} nuns heard the complaints of those people, and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, “How could Venerable \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} ask the king for his linen cloak?” … “Is it true, monks, that the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} asked for this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.16} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.17} Buddha rebuked her … “How could the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} ask the king for his linen cloak? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:

Venerables,\marginnote{0.6} these one hundred and sixty-six rules on offenses entailing confession come up for recitation. 

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time a lay follower had invited the Sangha of nuns to ask for garlic: “If any of the nuns need garlic, I’ll supply it.” And he had told his field-keeper, “If the nuns come, give two or three bulbs to each nun.”\footnote{“Bulb” renders \textit{\textsanskrit{bhaṇḍika}}. Normally I render this word as “bundle”, but here the intended meaning seems to be a “bundle” of cloves, that is, a single bulb of garlic. Sp 2.793: \textit{Dve tayo \textsanskrit{bhaṇḍiketi} dve \textsanskrit{vā} tayo \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{poṭṭalike}; \textsanskrit{sampuṇṇamiñjānametaṁ} \textsanskrit{adhivacanaṁ}}, “Two or three \textit{\textsanskrit{bhaṇḍika}}: two or three bundles; this is an expression for being complete in cloves.” } 

On\marginnote{1.6} that occasion they were holding a celebration in \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}, and the garlic was used up as soon as it arrived there. Just then the nuns went to that lay follower and said, “We need garlic.” 

“Venerables,\marginnote{1.10} there isn’t any. As soon as the garlic arrives, it’s used up. Please go to the field.” 

The\marginnote{1.13} nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} went to the field, and not having any sense of moderation she took a large amount of garlic. The field-keeper complained and criticized them, “How can the nuns not have any sense of moderation and take a large amount of garlic?” 

The\marginnote{1.16} nuns heard the complaints of that field-keeper, and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, “How could Venerable \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} not have any sense of moderation and take a large amount of garlic?” … “Is it true, monks, that the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.20} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.21} Buddha rebuked her, “How could the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} not have any sense of moderation and take a large amount of garlic? This will affect people’s confidence …” … and after giving a teaching he addressed the monks: 

\subparagraph*{Jataka }

“Once\marginnote{1.25.1} upon a time, monks, \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} was the wife of a brahmin. They had three daughters, \textsanskrit{Nandā}, \textsanskrit{Nandavatī}, and \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā}. When that brahmin eventually died, he was reborn as a goose, whose feathers were all made of gold. And he gave his former family members one feather at the time. \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} considered this. She then grabbed hold of that king of geese and plucked him. But when his feathers regrew they were white. At that time too, monks, \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} lost her gold because she was too greedy. Now she will lose her garlic.” 

\begin{verse}%
“One\marginnote{1.35} should be content with what one gets, \\
Because excessive greed is bad. \\
After grabbing hold of the king of geese, \\
The gold came to an end.” 

%
\end{verse}

Then,\marginnote{1.39} after rebuking the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} in many ways, the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\item[Garlic: ] from Magadha is what is meant. %
\end{description}

If\marginnote{2.1.7} she receives it with the intention of eating it, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.\footnote{The punctuation of the Pali should presumably be amended to \textit{‘\textsanskrit{Khādissāmī}”ti \textsanskrit{paṭiggaṇhāti}, \textsanskrit{āpatti} \textsanskrit{dukkaṭassa}}. } For every mouthful, she commits an offense entailing confession. 

\subsection*{Permutations }

If\marginnote{2.2.1} it is garlic and she perceives it as such, and she eats it, she commits an offense entailing confession. If it is garlic, but she is unsure of it, and she eats it, she commits an offense entailing confession. If it is garlic, but she does not perceive it as such, and she eats it, she commits an offense entailing confession. 

If\marginnote{2.2.4} it is not garlic, but she perceives it as such, and she eats it, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is not garlic, but she is unsure of it, and she eats it, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is not garlic and she does not perceive it as such, and she eats it, there is no offense. 

\subsection*{Non-offenses }

There\marginnote{2.3.1} is no offense: if it is an onion;  if it is a shallot;\footnote{DOP says of the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhañjanaka}} that it is “a kind of onion or similar vegetable”. The commentarial description, however, is an almost perfect fit for a shallot. Sp 2.797: \textsanskrit{Bhañjanako} \textsanskrit{lohitavaṇṇo}. … \textsanskrit{Miñjāya} pana … \textsanskrit{bhañjanakassa} dve, “The \textsanskrit{bhañjanaka} is red. … But in regard to cloves … the \textsanskrit{bhañjanaka} has two.” }  if it is chebulic myrobalan;\footnote{The botanical name is \textit{Terminalia chebula}, see SED and SAF, p. 57. It is also known as “black myrobalan”. }  if it is a spring onion;\footnote{DOP suggests “spring onion” for \textit{\textsanskrit{cāpalasuṇa}} with a question mark. Its identity therefore remains uncertain. Sp 2.797: \textit{\textsanskrit{Cāpalasuṇo} \textsanskrit{amiñjako}, \textsanskrit{aṅkuramattameva} hi tassa hoti}, “The \textit{\textsanskrit{cāpalasuṇa}} does not have cloves. It is just a sprout.” }  if it is cooked in a bean curry;  if it is cooked with meat;  if it is cooked with oil;  if it is in sweets;\footnote{“Sweets” renders \textit{\textsanskrit{sāḷava}}. SED, sv. \textit{\textsanskrit{shāḍava}}, says: “confectionery, sweetmeats”. }  if it is a special curry;  if she is insane;  if she is the first offender.

The sex workers complained and criticized them, “How can the nuns remove the hair from their private parts? They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!”

Another nun who was plagued by lust went to that nun and said, “Venerable, the king only came to you at long intervals. How did you cope?”

At\marginnote{1.1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country in the Banyan Tree Monastery at Kapilavatthu, \textsanskrit{Mahāpajāpati} \textsanskrit{Gotamī} went to him and bowed. Standing downwind from him, she said, “Sir, women smell.” 

“Well\marginnote{1.1.4} then, the nuns should clean themselves with water.” And the Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching, after which she bowed down, circumambulated him with her right side toward him, and left. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow the nuns to clean themselves with water.” }

Being\marginnote{1.2.1} aware that the Buddha had allowed cleaning with water, a nun did it too deeply, causing a sore in her vagina. 

She\marginnote{1.2.3} told the nuns what had happened. The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, “How could a nun clean herself too deeply with water?” … “Is it true, monks, that a nun did this?”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, a government official called Ārohanta became a monk and his ex-wife a nun. On one occasion that monk was having his meal in the presence of that nun. While he was eating, she attended on him with drinking water and a fan, and she flirted with him. But he dismissed her, saying, “Don’t do that; it’s not allowable.” 

“Before\marginnote{1.9} you did such and such to me, but now you can’t even take this much.” And she dropped the water vessel on its head and struck him with the fan.\footnote{It is not clear whether \textit{matthake}, “on the head”, refers to the water vessel or the monk. I have assumed it is the latter since it seems more meaningful. } 

The\marginnote{1.11} nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, “How could a nun hit a monk?” … “Is it true, monks, that a nun did this?”

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, a brahmin who had earned money by working for the king thought, “I’ll ask for my wages.” After washing his hair, he walked past the nuns’ dwelling place on his way to the king’s residence. Just then, after defecating in a pot, a nun disposed of the feces over a wall, and it landed on the head of that brahmin. He complained and criticized the nuns, “They’re not monastics, these shaven-headed sluts! How can they dump shit on my head? I’m gonna burn their place down!” And he got hold of a firebrand and entered their dwelling place. Just then a lay follower who was coming out from the nuns’ dwelling place saw that brahmin with a firebrand on his way in, and he said to him, “Sir, why are you entering the nuns’ dwelling place with a firebrand?” 

“These\marginnote{1.12} shaven-headed sluts dumped shit on my head. I’m gonna burn their place down!” 

“But\marginnote{1.14} this is auspicious, brahmin! You’ll get your wages and a thousand coins in addition.” 

That\marginnote{1.16} brahmin then washed his hair, went to the king’s residence, and he got his wages and a thousand coins in addition. 

But\marginnote{1.17} that lay follower returned to the nuns’ dwelling place, told them what had happened, and then scolded them. The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can nuns dispose of feces over a wall?” … “Is it true, monks, that nuns do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.21} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.22} Buddha rebuked them, “How can nuns dispose of feces over a wall? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} visited families after the meal, and she sat down and lay down on the seats without asking permission of the owners. Because of \textsanskrit{Thullanandā}, the people there had qualms,  neither sitting nor lying down. They then complained and criticized her, “How could Venerable \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} visit families after the meal, and then sit down and lie down on the seats without asking the owners for permission?” 

The\marginnote{1.6} nuns heard the complaints of those people. The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, “How could Venerable \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} act in this way?” … “Is it true, monks, that the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.10} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.11} Buddha rebuked her … “How could the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} act in this way? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time a number of nuns were traveling through the Kosalan country on their way to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}, when one evening they arrived at a certain village. There they went to a brahmin family and asked for a place to stay. The brahmin woman told them, “Please wait, Venerables, until my husband returns.” While they were waiting, the nuns put out bedding, and some sat down on it while others lay down. 

When\marginnote{1.7} the husband returned at night, he said to his wife, “Who are they?” 

“They\marginnote{1.9} are nuns.” 

“Throw\marginnote{1.10} out these shaven-headed sluts!”, and he had them thrown out of the house. 

Those\marginnote{1.11} nuns then went to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}, where they told the nuns what had happened. The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can nuns visit families at the wrong time, put out bedding without asking permission of the owners, and then sit down and lie down on it?” … “Is it true, monks, that nuns did this?”

The sex workers teased the nuns, “Venerables, why practice the spiritual life when you’re still young? Why not enjoy worldly pleasures? You can practice the spiritual life when you’re old. In this way you’ll get the benefit of both.” The nuns felt humiliated. 

They\marginnote{1.8} then went to the nuns’ dwelling place and told the nuns what had happened. The nuns told the monks, who in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the nuns for the following ten reasons: for the well-being of the Sangha … for supporting the training. And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:

They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 

The\marginnote{1.5} nuns heard the complaints of those people, and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can nuns do this?” … “Is it true, monks, that nuns do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.9} true, Sir.”

In the same way, the plural \textit{\textsanskrit{bhātāro}}, “brothers”, can mean “siblings”.

Please,\marginnote{2.1.39} Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The nun so-and-so is socializing with householders and their offspring. And she keeps on doing it.

At that time the nuns were staying right there at \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} for the rainy season, the winter, and the summer. People complained and criticized them, “The nuns are leaving the districts in darkness and obscurity. They don’t brighten them up by their presence.” 

The\marginnote{1.5} nuns heard the complaints of those people. They then told the monks, who in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the nuns for the following ten reasons: for the well-being of the Sangha … for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training. And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, artwork had been installed in the pleasure house in King Pasenadi of Kosala’s park. Many people visited the pleasure house, as did the nuns from the group of six. People complained and criticized them, “How can nuns visit a pleasure house?

\item[A garden: ] wherever one has been made for a people to entertain and enjoy themselves. %
\item[A lotus pond: ] wherever one has been made for a people to entertain and enjoy themselves.\footnote{The usual meaning of \textit{\textsanskrit{pokkharaṇī}} as “lotus pond” is well established in the suttas. Much of the time they seem to have been decorative, but there are few instances in the Vinaya where they are used for washing, such as in \textsanskrit{Mahā}-khandhaka where the Buddha washes a cloth in a \textit{\textsanskrit{pokkharaṇī}} (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali\#20.1.4}{Kd 1:20.1.4}). In fact, this distinction in use is reflected in the commentaries, which speak of \textit{\textsanskrit{nahāna}-\textsanskrit{pokkharaṇī}}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{pokkharaṇi}} for bathing”, and \textit{\textsanskrit{kīḷana}-\textsanskrit{pokkharaṇi}}, “\textit{\textsanskrit{pokkharaṇi}} for playing”. Because \textit{\textsanskrit{pokkharaṇis}} were given to monasteries “for the benefit of the Sangha” (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali\#17.2.1}{Kd 15:17.2.1}), they were probably meant for bathing and washing, not just for decoration. Moreover, it seems the \textit{\textsanskrit{pokkharaṇis}} could be quite elaborate structures with foundations, staircases, and rails (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali\#17.2.6}{Kd 15:17.2.1}). For these reasons I vary my translation according to context, sometimes using “pond”, at other times “tank”, and sometimes adding the qualifier “lotus”. } %

\subsection*{Origin story }

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, a number of monks dressed only in sarongs were making robes in a certain village monastery. Nuns entered that monastery without asking permission and approached those monks. The monks complained and criticized them, “How can nuns enter a monastery without asking permission?” … “Is it true, monks, that nuns did that?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.7} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.8} Buddha rebuked them … “How can nuns do that? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 

\subsubsection*{First preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a nun enters a monastery without asking permission, she commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{1.13} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the nuns. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards those monks left that monastery. But even though the nuns had heard that the monks had left, they did not go there. Soon the monks returned. When the nuns heard that this was the case, they asked permission and then entered that monastery. They approached the monks and bowed down to them. The monks then said to them, “Sisters, why didn’t you sweep the monastery, or put out water for drinking or water for washing?” 

“The\marginnote{2.7} Buddha has laid down a training rule that we may not enter a monastery without asking permission. That’s why we didn’t do it.” 

They\marginnote{2.9} told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and addressed the monks: “Monks, when a monk is available, a nun should enter a monastery only after asking permission. And so, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 

\subsubsection*{Second preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a nun, when a monk is available, enters a monastery without asking permission, she commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

In\marginnote{2.13} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the nuns. 

\subsubsection*{Third sub-story }

After\marginnote{3.1} leaving that monastery once more, the monks returned yet again. Thinking that the monks were still away, the nuns entered the monastery without asking permission. The nuns became anxious, thinking, “We have entered a monastery without asking permission, even though a monk was available. And the Buddha has laid down a training rule against this. Could it be that we have committed an offense entailing confession?” 

They\marginnote{3.6} told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “And so, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a nun, knowing that there are monks in a monastery, enters it without asking permission, she commits an offense entailing confession.’” }

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying  in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood near \textsanskrit{Vesālī}, Venerable \textsanskrit{Upāli}’s preceptor, Venerable Kappita, was staying in a charnel ground. At that time the leader of the nuns from the group of six had just died. They took her to that charnel ground, cremated her near Venerable Kappita’s dwelling, and made a stupa. They then went there to cry. 

Venerable\marginnote{1.5} Kappita was disturbed by the noise, and so he demolished the stupa and scattered the rubble. The nuns from the group of six thought, “Kappita has demolished our Venerable’s stupa; let’s kill him,” and they laid a plan. A certain nun told Venerable \textsanskrit{Upāli} what was happening, and he in turn told Venerable Kappita. Venerable Kappita then left his dwelling and went into hiding. Soon afterwards the nuns from the group of six went to his dwelling and crushed it with rocks and lumps of earth. When they thought he was dead, they left. 

The\marginnote{1.13} following morning Venerable Kappita robed up, took his bowl and robe, and entered \textsanskrit{Vesālī} for almsfood. When the nuns from the group of six saw him, they said, “Kappita is alive! Who spoiled our plan?” 

When\marginnote{1.17} they heard it was Venerable \textsanskrit{Upāli}, they abused him, “How could this barber, this dirt remover of inferior caste, spoil our plan?” 

The\marginnote{1.21} nuns of few desires complained and criticized them, “How could the nuns from the group of six abuse Venerable \textsanskrit{Upāli}?” … “Is it true, monks, that those nuns did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.24} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.25} Buddha rebuked them … “How could the nuns from the group of six do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time the nun \textsanskrit{Caṇḍakāḷī} was quarrelsome and argumentative, and she created legal issues in the Sangha. But when a legal procedure was being done against her, the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} objected. 

Soon\marginnote{1.4} afterwards when \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} went to a village on some business, the Sangha of nuns took the opportunity to eject \textsanskrit{Caṇḍakāḷī} for not recognizing an offense. When \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} had finished her business, she returned to \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. As she was approaching, \textsanskrit{Caṇḍakāḷī} neither prepared a seat for her, nor set out a foot stool, a foot scraper, or water for washing the feet; and she did not go out to meet her to receive her bowl and robe or to ask whether she wanted water to drink. \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} asked her why she was acting like this. She replied, “That’s how it is, Venerable, when one doesn’t have a protector.” 

“But\marginnote{1.14} how is it, Venerable, that you don’t have a protector?” 

“When\marginnote{1.15} these nuns knew that no one would speak up for me because I am not esteemed by them and I didn’t have a protector, they ejected me for not recognizing an offense.” 

“They\marginnote{1.17} are incompetent fools! They don’t understand legal procedures, nor what makes them fail or succeed.” And being furious, she reviled the community.\footnote{In this case \textit{\textsanskrit{gaṇa}} seems to stand for the Sangha that did the legal procedure against \textsanskrit{Caṇḍakāḷī}. See also the definition of \textit{\textsanskrit{gaṇa}} below. } 

The\marginnote{1.19} nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, “How could Venerable \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} revile the community because she is furious?” … “Is it true, monks, that the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.22} true, Sir.”

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, a certain brahmin had invited the nuns for a meal. When the nuns had finished and refused an invitation to eat more, they went to their respective families, where some ate and others got almsfood and left. 

Soon\marginnote{1.4} afterwards that brahmin said this to his neighbors, “I have satisfied the nuns. Come, and I’ll satisfy you, too.” 

“How\marginnote{1.6} could you satisfy us? Those nuns who were invited by you came to our houses, where some ate and others got almsfood and left.” 

That\marginnote{1.9} brahmin complained and criticized those nuns, “How could they eat in our house and afterwards eat elsewhere? Am I not able to give them as much as they want?” 

The\marginnote{1.11} nuns heard the complaints of that brahmin, and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized them, “How could nuns finish their meal, refuse an invitation to eat more, and then eat elsewhere?” … “Is it true, monks, that nuns did this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.15} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.16} Buddha rebuked them … “How could nuns act in this way? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘If a nun, who has been invited to a meal, refuses an invitation to eat more, and then eats fresh or cooked food, she commits an offense entailing confession.’”\footnote{“Refuses an offer to eat more” renders \textit{\textsanskrit{pavārita}}. I normally translate both \textit{nimantita} and \textit{\textsanskrit{pavārita}} as “invited”. Yet this becomes awkward on the rare occasions, such as here, when the two words occur together, and so in this instance I instead use the verb “offer” for \textit{\textsanskrit{pavārita}}. Moreover, in the present case, the contextual meaning of \textit{\textsanskrit{pavārita}} is that the nun has expressed her satisfaction after being invited to take more, thus my rendering. See the discussion of this rule in Appendix on Individual \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī} Rules.

She then went to a certain family where she sat down on the prepared seat. The people there gave her a meal and said, “Venerable, other nuns may come too.” Then that nun thought, “What can I do so that other nuns don’t come?” And she went up to other nuns and said, “Venerables, in such-and-such a place there are malicious dogs, a fierce ox, and it’s muddy. Don’t go there.” 

Another\marginnote{1.9} nun, too, went to that family while walking for almsfood along that street. She sat down on the prepared seat and the people there gave her a meal. They then asked her, “Venerable, why don’t the nuns come here?” 

And\marginnote{1.12} she told them what had happened. 

People\marginnote{1.13} complained and criticized her, “How can a nun keep a family to herself?” … “Is it true, monks, that a nun acted like this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.16} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.17} Buddha rebuked her … “How could a nun act like this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:

“Monks,\marginnote{1.13} approval is required for a trainee nun to train in the six rules for two years.\footnote{For the contextual meaning of the Pali, see \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc64/en/brahmali\#1.36.1}{Bi Pc 64:1.36.1}. } 

And\marginnote{1.14} it should be given like this. 

After\marginnote{1.15} approaching the Sangha of nuns, that trainee nun should arrange her upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the nuns. She should then squat on her heels, raise her joined palms, and say: 

‘Venerables,\marginnote{1.16} I, so-and-so, am a trainee nun under Venerable so-and-so. I ask the Sangha for approval to train for two years in the six rules.’ And she should ask a second and a third time. 

A\marginnote{1.20} competent and capable nun should then inform the Sangha: 

‘Please,\marginnote{1.21} Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. So-and-so, who is a trainee nun under Venerable so-and-so, is asking the Sangha for approval to train in the six rules for two years. If the Sangha is ready, it should give approval to trainee nun so-and-so to train in the six rules for two years. This is the motion. 

Please,\marginnote{1.25} Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. So-and-so, who is a trainee nun under Venerable so-and-so, is asking the Sangha for approval to train in the six rules for two years. The Sangha gives approval to trainee nun so-and-so to train in the six rules for two years. Any nun who approves of giving approval to trainee nun so-and-so to train in the six rules for two years should remain silent. Any nun who doesn’t approve should speak up. 

The\marginnote{1.30} Sangha has given approval to trainee nun so-and-so to train in the six rules for two years. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’ 

That\marginnote{1.32} trainee nun should then be told to say this: ‘I undertake to abstain from killing living beings for two years without transgression. I undertake to abstain from stealing for two years without transgression. I undertake to abstain from sexual activity for two years without transgression. I undertake to abstain from lying for two years without transgression. I undertake to abstain from alcohol, which causes heedlessness, for two years without transgression. I undertake to abstain from eating at the wrong time for two years without transgression.’” 

Then,\marginnote{1.39} after rebuking those nuns in many ways, the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time the nuns were giving the full admission to trainee nuns who had trained in the six rules for two years, but who had not been approved by the Sangha. The nuns said, “Come, trainee nuns, find out about this,” “Give this,” “Bring this,” “There’s need for this,” or “Make this allowable.” But they replied, “Venerables, we’re not trainee nuns. We’re nuns.” 

The\marginnote{1.7} nuns of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can nuns give the full admission to trainee nuns who have trained for two years in the six rules, but who haven’t been approved by the Sangha?” … “Is it true, monks, that nuns do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.10} true, Sir.”

At that time the nuns were giving the full admission to unmarried girls who were more than twenty years old, but who had not trained for two years in the six rules.

The\marginnote{1.5} nuns of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can nuns give the full admission to unmarried girls who are more than twenty years old, but who haven’t trained for two years in the six rules?” … “Is it true, monks, that nuns do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.8} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.9} Buddha rebuked them … “How can nuns do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

“Monks,\marginnote{1.14} approval is required for an unmarried girl who is eighteen years old to train in the six rules for two years. 

And\marginnote{1.15} the approval is to be given like this. 

After\marginnote{1.16} approaching the Sangha of nuns, that unmarried girl who is eighteen years old should arrange her upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the nuns. She should then squat on her heels, raise her joined palms, and say: 

‘Venerables,\marginnote{1.17} I, so-and-so, an unmarried girl who is eighteen years old, am training under Venerable so-and-so. I ask the Sangha for approval to train for two years in the six rules.’\footnote{\textit{\textsanskrit{Itthannāmāya} \textsanskrit{ayyāya}} is probably the genitive case, which would literally mean that the trainee nun “belongs” to her teacher. I take this to be an indirect reference to being her student. } 

And\marginnote{1.18} she should ask a second and a third time. 

A\marginnote{1.20} competent and capable nun should then inform the Sangha: 

‘Please,\marginnote{1.21} Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. This unmarried girl so-and-so, who is eighteen years old and training under Venerable so-and-so, is asking the Sangha for approval to train in the six rules for two years. If the Sangha is ready, it should give approval to the unmarried girl so-and-so who is eighteen years old to train in the six rules for two years. This is the motion.

The Sangha gives approval to the unmarried girl so-and-so who is eighteen years old to train in the six rules for two years. Any nun who approves of giving approval to the unmarried girl so-and-so who is eighteen years old to train in the six rules for two years should remain silent.

The\marginnote{1.30} Sangha has given approval to the unmarried girl so-and-so who is eighteen years old to train in the six rules for two years. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’ 

That\marginnote{1.32} unmarried girl who is eighteen years old should be told to say this: ‘I undertake to abstain from killing living beings for two years without transgression. … I undertake to abstain from eating at the wrong time for two years without transgression.’”

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Jeta Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery. At that time nuns who had twelve years of seniority were giving the full admission without being approved by the Sangha. They were ignorant and incompetent, and they did not know what was allowable and what was not. And their students too were ignorant and incompetent, and they too did not know what was allowable and what was not. 

The\marginnote{1.7} nuns of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can nuns who have twelve years of seniority give the full admission without being approved by the Sangha?” … “Is it true, monks, that nuns do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.10} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.11} Buddha rebuked them … “How can nuns do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: 

“Monks,\marginnote{1.16} approval is required for a nun who has twelve years of seniority to give the full admission. 

And\marginnote{1.17} the approval is to be given like this. 

After\marginnote{1.18} approaching the Sangha of nuns, that nun who has twelve years of seniority should arrange her upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior nuns. She should then squat on her heels, raise her joined palms, and say: 

‘Venerables,\marginnote{1.19} I, the nun so-and-so who has twelve years of seniority, ask the Sangha for approval to give the full admission.’ 

And\marginnote{1.20} she should ask a second and a third time. 

The\marginnote{1.22} Sangha should then decide whether that nun is competent and has a sense of conscience. 

\begin{itemize}%
\item If she is ignorant and shameless, approval should not be given. %
\item If she is ignorant but has a sense of conscience, approval should not be given. %
\item If she is competent but shameless, approval should not be given. %
\item If she is competent and has a sense of conscience, approval should be given. %
\end{itemize}

And\marginnote{1.27} it is to be given like this. A competent and capable nun should inform the Sangha: 

‘Please,\marginnote{1.29} Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The nun so-and-so, who has twelve years of seniority, is asking the Sangha for approval to give the full admission. If the Sangha is ready, it should give approval to nun so-and-so, who has twelve years of seniority, to give the full admission. This is the motion. 

Please,\marginnote{1.33} Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The nun so-and-so, who has twelve years of seniority, is asking the Sangha for approval to give the full admission. The Sangha gives approval to nun so-and-so, who has twelve years of seniority, to give the full admission. Any nun who approves of giving approval to nun so-and-so, who has twelve years of seniority, to give the full admission should remain silent. Any nun who doesn’t approve should speak up. 

The\marginnote{1.38} Sangha has given approval to nun so-and-so, who has twelve years of seniority, to give the full admission. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’” 

Then,\marginnote{1.40} after rebuking those nuns in many ways, the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:

When\marginnote{1.2} people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them, “How can the nuns get a female householder to massage and rub them? They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 

The\marginnote{1.4} nuns heard the complaints of those people. 

The\marginnote{1.5} nuns of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can nuns get a female householder to massage and rub them?” 

“Is\marginnote{1.7} it true, monks, that the nuns do this?”

\subsection*{Origin story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, a nun had gone to the village for alms without wearing her chest wrap.

After\marginnote{1.7} returning to the nuns’ dwelling place, she told the nuns what had happened. The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her, “How could a nun enter an inhabited area without wearing her chest wrap?” … “Is it true, monks, that a nun did this?”

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, the nuns from the group of six were eating ghee that they had asked for. People complained and criticized them, “How can nuns eat ghee that they have asked for? Who doesn’t like nice food? Who doesn’t prefer tasty food?” 

The\marginnote{1.1.6} nuns heard the complaints of those people. The nuns of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can the nuns from the group of six eat ghee that they have asked for?” … “Is it true, monks, that those nuns do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.1.10} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.1.11} Buddha rebuked them … “How can the nuns from the group of six do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 

\subsubsection*{First preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘If a nun asks for ghee and then eats it, she must acknowledge it: “I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’” }

In\marginnote{1.1.17} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the nuns. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{1.2.1} afterwards a number of nuns were sick. The nuns who were looking after them asked, “I hope you’re bearing up? I hope you’re getting better?” 

“Previously\marginnote{1.2.4} we ate ghee that we had asked for, and then we were comfortable. But now that the Buddha has prohibited this, we don’t ask because we’re afraid of wrongdoing. And because of that we’re not comfortable.” … 

They\marginnote{1.2.6} told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow a sick nun to eat ghee that she has asked for. }

And\marginnote{1.2.8} so, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this:

One\marginnote{1.15} should wear one’s sarong evenly all around, covering the navel and the knees. If a nun, out of disrespect, wears her sarong hanging down in front or behind, she commits an offense of wrong conduct.

\subsubsection*{First sub-story }

At\marginnote{1.1} one time when the Buddha was staying at \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s Monastery, the nuns from the group of six were defecating, urinating, and spitting in water. People complained and criticized them, “How can nuns defecate, urinate, and spit in water? They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” 

The\marginnote{1.5} nuns heard the complaints of those people, and the nuns of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can the nuns from the group of six defecate, urinate, and spit in water?” The nuns told the monks, who in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that those nuns do this?” 

“It’s\marginnote{1.13} true, Sir.” 

The\marginnote{1.14} Buddha rebuked them … “How can the nuns from the group of six do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 

\subsubsection*{Preliminary ruling }

\scrule{‘“I will not defecate, urinate, or spit in water,” this is how you should train.’” }

In\marginnote{1.19} this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the nuns. 

\subsubsection*{Second sub-story }

Soon\marginnote{2.1} afterwards, being afraid of wrongdoing, sick nuns did not defecate, urinate, or spit in water. They told the Buddha. He then had the Sangha gathered and addressed the monks: 

\scrule{“Monks, I allow a sick nun to defecate, urinate, and spit in water. }

And\marginnote{2.4} so, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: 

\subsection*{Final ruling }

\scrule{‘“When not sick, I will not defecate, urinate, or spit in water,” this is how you should train.’” }

If\marginnote{2.6} one is not sick, one should not defecate, urinate, or spit in water. If, out of disrespect, a nun who is not sick defecates, urinates, or spits in water, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. 

\subsection*{Non-offenses }

There\marginnote{2.8.1} is no offense: if it is unintentional;  if she is not mindful;  if she does not know;  if she is sick;  if she does it on dry ground, but it then spreads to water;  if there is an emergency;  if she is insane;  if she is deranged;  if she is overwhelmed by pain;  if she is the first offender.

\subsection*{\textit{\textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{pārājika}} 1}

This rule is largely identical with \textit{bhikkhu \textsanskrit{pārājika}} 1, except for a slight change of wording. For reference, here are the monks’ and the nuns’ versions of this rule:

\begin{quotation}%
“If a monk, after taking on the monks’ training and way of life, without first renouncing the training and revealing his weakness, has sexual intercourse, even with a female animal, he is expelled and excluded from the community.” (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali\#7.1.16.1}{Bu~Pj~1:7.1.16.1})

%
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}%
“If a nun willingly has sexual intercourse, even with a male animal, she is expelled and excluded from the community.” (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-pm/en/brahmali\#9.1}{Bi~Pm:9.1})

%
\end{quotation}

There are two main differences. The nuns’ rule adds the word “willingly”, \textit{chandaso}, while it omits the phrase “after taking on the monks’ training and way of life, without first renouncing the training and revealing his weakness”.\footnote{\textit{\textsanskrit{Bhikkhūnaṁ} \textsanskrit{sikkhāsājīvasamāpanno} \textsanskrit{sikkhaṁ} \textsanskrit{appaccakkhāya} \textsanskrit{dubbalyaṁ} \textsanskrit{anāvikatvā}.} } I’ve discussed both at length in the introduction to this volume and have nothing to add here.

There are also two minor gender changes, which do warrant commenting on. The agent of the rule is now a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} rather than a \textit{bhikkhu}, which affects the grammatical gender of any words that agree with the agent, of which there are three in this particular rule (\textit{\textsanskrit{yā}}, \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājikā}}, and \textit{\textsanskrit{asaṁvāsā}}). This is merely a mechanical change that affects all the rules that the monks and the nuns have in common. It has no bearing on the nature or scope of the offense.

The other minor change is marginally more interesting. Towards the end of the rule we find the clause \textit{antamaso \textsanskrit{tiracchānagatāyapi}}, “even with a male animal”, which means that the offense is incurred even for having sex with an animal. For the monks we find the feminine ending, -\textit{\textsanskrit{āya}}, whereas for the nuns we have the masculine ending, -\textit{ena}. This is as expected, since it reasonable to assume that even in the exceptional case of sex with an animal it is more likely to happen with an animal of the opposite sex. This might seem to suggest that one would not incur an offense for having sex with an animal of one’s own gender. However, we know from the detailed exposition of \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} 1 that such sex, too, incurs the full penalty under this rule (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali\#9.1.24}{Bu~Pj~1:9.1.24}).

How then do we explain the gender difference in the animal? The most likely explanation is that the grammatical ending reflects the fact that an animal is either male or female, which means there can be no neutral grammatical ending for animals. And given the lack of a neutral ending, it is only natural to pair the feminine ending with the monks’ rule and the masculine ending with the one for the nuns. The fact that one is forced to make a grammatical gender choice, however, does not mean that the rule is restricted to animals of the equivalent gender.

\subsection*{\textit{\textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{pārājika}} 5}

\textit{\textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{pārājika}} 5 presents us with the seemingly strange case of a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} committing a \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} offense by consenting to the touch of a man, but no offense at all if she herself touches a man. The rule reads as follows:

\begin{quotation}%
“If a lustful nun consents to a lustful man making physical contact with her, to touching her, to taking hold of her, to contacting her, or to squeezing her, anywhere below the collar bone but above the knees, she too is expelled and excluded from the community. The training rule on above the knees.” (\href{https://suttacentral.nethttps://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5/en/brahmali/en/brahmali\#1.54.1}{Bi~Pj~5:1.54.1})

%
\end{quotation}

To get our bearings, let’s start by investigating the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga}. The word-definition section has no relevant information, but the permutation series does. Here is the first permutation, which is typical of the entire series:

\begin{quotation}%
If both have lust and he/she makes physical contact, below the collar bone but above the knees, body to body, she commits an offense entailing expulsion. (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5/en/brahmali\#2.2.1}{Bi~Pj~5:2.2.1})

%
\end{quotation}

“Makes physical contact” renders \textit{\textsanskrit{āmasati}}. No agent is specified, and thus my provisional rendering “he/she”. Going by the wording of the rule, it would seem the agent must be the man. The commentary, however, states that the agent may be either the man or the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}}:

\begin{quotation}%
Makes physical contact, body with body: the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} touches whatever (part of the) body of a man with her body as delimited, or the man touches the body of the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} as delimited with whatever (part of) his body. In both cases, there is a \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} offense for the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}}.\footnote{Sp 2.659: \textit{\textsanskrit{Kāyena} \textsanskrit{kāyaṁ} \textsanskrit{āmasatīti} \textsanskrit{bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{yathāparicchinnena} \textsanskrit{kāyena} purisassa \textsanskrit{yaṁkiñci} \textsanskrit{kāyaṁ} puriso \textsanskrit{vā} yena kenaci \textsanskrit{kāyena} \textsanskrit{bhikkhuniyā} \textsanskrit{yathāparicchinnaṁ} \textsanskrit{kāyaṁ} \textsanskrit{āmasati}, \textsanskrit{ubhayathāpi} \textsanskrit{bhikkhuniyā} \textsanskrit{pārājikaṁ}}. \textit{\textsanskrit{Yathāparicchinnena}}, “as delimited”, presumably refers to the fact that the touching must be below the collar bone and above the knees. }

%
\end{quotation}

Is there anything in the Canonical text that supports the commentary? As it happens, there is one unusual case in the permutation series that deserves closer attention. The ambiguity in the agent continues for the entire permutation series, except in one case:

\begin{quotation}%
If both have lust and she makes physical contact with a spirit, a ghost, a \textit{\textsanskrit{paṇḍaka}}, or an animal in human form, below the collar bone but above the knees, body to body, she commits a serious offense. (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj5/en/brahmali\#2.2.29.1}{Bi~Pj~5:2.2.29.1})

%
\end{quotation}

Contrary to the formulation of the rule, in this sentence it seems required that the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} is the agent. The various beings that are mentioned here are all in the genitive/dative case, which suggests they are not doing the touching, but are being touched. If the agent of \textit{\textsanskrit{āmasati}} in this case is the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}}, then it would be natural to conclude that the same must be true for the entire permutation series. The parallels in wording are just too close. This might then be taken as lending support to the commentarial position, which would mean that the agent may be either the man or the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}}. This would resolve the ambiguity.

Still, there are some immediate problems with the above suggestion. As we have just seen, the above sentence suggests that the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} is the only agent. Yet taking the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} as the sole agent for the entire permutation series goes too far, because it would fly in the face of the wording of the rule. What we have, in fact, are two different and irreconcilable positions: (i) the position of the rule, which says the man is the agent, and (ii) the position of the one sentence from the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga}, which says the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} is the agent. Only in the Commentary is this combined to suggest that either the man or the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} can be the agent in all cases, including in the rule. Yet it is by no means obvious that the commentary is right about this.

Let’s return to the sentence above that apparently concerns a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} touching various kinds of beings. The first problem with understanding this sentence as suggested is that it leaves out the case of these beings touching the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}}. This is a rather major problem since the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} being touched, not the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} touching, is the concern of the main rule. It would mean that there is no statement anywhere about what the offense is if, for instance, a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} consents to being touched by a \textit{\textsanskrit{paṇḍaka}}. In this way, a secondary development of a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} doing the touching would be mentioned, whereas the main concern of the rule would not.

Another problem is that the permutation series would then mention the case of a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} touching a number of beings of various kinds, including those belonging to non-human realms, but would not mention the case of a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} touching a man. Thus, the most important case, by far, would be left out.

Given these obvious problems, I do not think it is acceptable to read the entire permutation series in light of this one unusual sentence. Instead, I think we need to follow the reading of the rule, which is only concerned with the case of a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} consenting to a man touching her. The case of a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} touching a man would not be covered.

How, then, might we understand the one sentence on other beings in the permutation series? I would suggest this sentence has been corrupted and originally had a structure closer to the one in the main rule. In the main rule the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} consents to the touch of a man, the man being expressed in the genitive case, \textit{purisapuggalassa}. The syntax of the sentence is such that this makes the man the agent. I would suggest the beings in the permutation series that are expressed in the genitive case should be understood in the same way. They are meant to be the actual agents of the sentence. The syntax no longer supports this, and thus my proposal that there has been a corruption of the text at some point in history. Originally the syntax may have been similar to what we find in the main rule.

Once we look at the text in this way, the problems mentioned above disappear. The case of various beings touching the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} is then no more than a subsidiary rule under the main one. And the case of a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} touching a man would not be included.

This suggestion is supported by the parallels to this rule in Chinese translation. Here are the translations of \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{pārājika}} 5, as found in five different Vinayas, all translated from the Chinese by \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{Vimalañāṇī}:

\begin{quotation}%
“If a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}}, with a defiled mind, allows a man with a defiled mind, having removed her robes, to rub her up and down below the hairline and above the knees and the wrists, to pull, push, press, and squeeze her, to lift her up and set her down, that \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} commits a \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}}, and doesn’t live in community.”\footnote{\textsanskrit{Sarvāstivāda} Vinaya, fascicle 42 (Part 1 of the seventh recitation chapter): \langlzh{若比丘尼有漏心，聽漏心男子髮際以下至腕膝以上却衣，順摩、逆摩、牽推、按掐、抱上、抱下，是比丘尼得波羅夷不共住。」} }

%
\end{quotation}

Here we see the use of the word “allows”, which presumably functions in the same way as “consents to” in the Pali version. The \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga} to this rule then uses the same term throughout. This means that this is all about the man being the agent, not the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}}.

\begin{quotation}%
“If a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} with a defiled mind and a man with defiled mind have their bodies touch each other with the thought to feel pleasure, below the eyes and above the knees, even with the slightest touch in this way, that \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} incurs a \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} and shouldn’t live in the community.”\footnote{\textsanskrit{Mūlasarvāstivāda} \textsanskrit{bhikkhunī} vinaya, fascicle 5: \langlzh{「若復苾芻尼自有染心，共染心男子，從目已下、膝已上，作受樂心身相摩觸、若極摩觸。於如是事，此苾芻尼亦得波羅市迦，不應共住。」} }

%
\end{quotation}

Here both the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} and the man are agents. This would seem to mean that there is only the full offense if both are involved in the touching.

\begin{quotation}%
“If a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} in a mind-state altered by abundant desire, lets a man rub and touch her in all kinds of ways below the hairline, above the knees, and above the elbows, that \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} incurs a \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}}, and doesn’t live in community.”\footnote{\textsanskrit{Mahīśāsaka} \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga}, pj 5: \langlzh{「若比丘尼，欲盛變心，受男子種種摩觸：髮際已下，膝已上，肘已後。是比丘尼得波羅夷，不共住。」} }

%
\end{quotation}

“Lets (rub and touch)” once again suggests that this has to do only with consent. No agency on the part of the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} is mentioned.

\begin{quotation}%
“If a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} with a defiled mind, feels pleasure from being rubbed and touched below the shoulders and above the knees by a man with a defiled mind, that \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} is \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}}, and shouldn’t live in community.”\footnote{\textsanskrit{Mahāsaṅghika} \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga}, pj 5: \langlzh{若比丘尼漏心。漏心男子邊肩以下膝以上摩觸受樂者。是比丘尼波羅夷不應共住。} }

%
\end{quotation}

Here the term “feels pleasure” is likely to be equivalent to “consents to”. The Pali word behind “to consent” is \textit{\textsanskrit{sādiyati}}, which can also be rendered as “to feel pleasure”. This, then, is a third case of only the man being the agent.

\begin{quotation}%
“If a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} with a defiled mind and a man with a defiled mind have their bodies touch each other below the armpits and above the knees; if they grasp, pull, push, rub upwards and downwards, lift up, set down, hold, and press each other, that \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} is \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}}, and doesn’t live in community, because she’s ‘one with bodily contact’.”\footnote{Dharmaguptaka \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga}, pj 5: \langlzh{若比丘尼染污心，共染污心男子，從腋已下膝已上身相觸，若捉摩、若牽、若推、若上摩、若下摩、若舉、若下、若捉、若捺，是比丘尼波羅夷，不共住。是身相觸也。」} }

%
\end{quotation}

This is a second case of both the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} and the man being agents. Yet even here the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga} focuses on the man as the agent.

If we include the Pali version, we have four cases where the man is the only agent, and two cases where also the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} is an agent. This suggests that only the man being the agent is the earlier reading. Moreover, in the two rules where both are agents, the natural interpretation is that the rule is only broken if \textit{both} take part in the touching. And so again, if the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} is the sole agent, there would be no offense. We have a situation where the man touching is always required for the committing of a \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} offense, whereas the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} touching is never sufficient in itself.

My overall conclusion from this brief comparative study is that there is no \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} offense for a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} who touches a man, whether she is lustful or not, assuming the man does not touch her. I would suggest the Pali should be interpreted accordingly.

\subsection*{\textit{\textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{pārājika}} 8}

In \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{pārājika}} 8 there is a series of eight actions. The question is whether a \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} has to do all eight or whether doing a single one is enough to commit the offense. Here is the rule for reference:

\begin{quotation}%
“If, for the purpose of indulging in inappropriate sexual conduct, a lustful nun consents to a lustful man holding her hand and the edge of her robe, and she stands with him and chats with him and goes to a rendezvous with him and consents to him coming to her and enters a covered place with him and disposes her body for him for that purpose, she too is expelled and excluded from the community. The training rule having eight parts.” (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj8/en/brahmali\#1.11.1}{Bi~Pj~8:1.11.1})

%
\end{quotation}

On the surface, it appears as if doing any one of the eight is sufficient. The eight actions are connected with the disjunctive \textit{\textsanskrit{vā}}, which is almost universally translated as “or”. However, in the word definitions that immediately follow the rule formulation, it is equally clear that doing a single action is not enough to commit a \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}}. Doing any of the sub-actions is stated to be a serious offense, a \textit{thullaccaya}. Going by this, all eight actions need to be done to incur the full offense of \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}}.

In fact, the interpretation of the word-definitions section is the only tenable one. Most of the sub-actions described in Bi Pj 8 are found as lesser rules elsewhere in the \textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī}-\textsanskrit{pātimokkha}. For instance, if “a lustful nun consents to a lustful man holding her hand”, it is a serious offense at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj8/en/brahmali\#2.1.11}{Bi~Pj~8:2.1.11}. Or if “a lustful nun consents to a lustful man holding the edge of her robe”, it is again a serious offense under the same rule at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj8/en/brahmali\#2.1.14}{Bi~Pj~8:2.1.14}. Or if “(a lustful nun) stands with him” or “she chats with him”, it is an offense entailing confession, a \textit{\textsanskrit{pācittiya}}, at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc11/en/brahmali\#1.12.1}{Bi~Pc~11}. I could go on, but that should be sufficient to make the point. Making each of the actions at Bi Pj 8 an offense of \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} would clash with how these actions are treated elsewhere. Again, we are compelled to interpret this rule as all eight actions needing to be fulfilled.

This is also the position of the commentary:

\begin{quotation}%
Even if she fulfills one of the eight or seven of the eight a hundred times, she is not expelled.\footnote{Sp 2.676: \textit{\textsanskrit{Yā} pana \textsanskrit{ekaṁ} \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{vatthuṁ} satta \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{vatthūni} satakkhattumpi \textsanskrit{pūreti}, neva \textsanskrit{assamaṇī} hoti}. }

%
\end{quotation}

Moreover, according to the \textsanskrit{Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī} commentary, if, before committing the eighth and final action that would result in a \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} offense, a nun confesses any of the previous seven partial transgressions, she does not incur a \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}}:

\begin{quotation}%
Therefore, if she has committed one (of the actions), but then makes a pledge of obligation (to practice the rules) and then confesses, if she then commits an offense again because of defilements, and confesses again, then even if she fulfills the eighth factor, she does not commit an offense entailing expulsion.\footnote{\textit{\textsanskrit{Tasmā} \textsanskrit{yā} \textsanskrit{ekaṁ} \textsanskrit{āpannā} \textsanskrit{dhuranikkhepaṁ} \textsanskrit{katvā} \textsanskrit{desetvā} puna kilesavasena \textsanskrit{āpajjati}, puna pi deseti, evam \textsanskrit{aṭṭhamaṁ} \textsanskrit{paripūrentī} pi \textsanskrit{pārājika} na hoti.} }

%
\end{quotation}

The evidence, then, strongly suggests that the \textit{\textsanskrit{vā}} in the rule must be understood as “and” rather than “or”. Taking a closer look at Pali literature, we discover that \textit{\textsanskrit{vā}} is quite commonly used as a conjunctive instead of a disjunctive. The same, it seems, is true for Sanskrit literature. Starting with the Sanskrit, SED says this:

\begin{quotation}%
\textit{\textsanskrit{Vā}} is sometimes interchangeable with \textit{ca} and \textit{api} … (sv. \textit{\textsanskrit{vā}})

%
\end{quotation}

Closer to home, the Pali commentaries frequently gloss \textit{\textsanskrit{vā}} as a conjunction, defining it with the terms \textit{samuccaya} and \textit{\textsanskrit{sampiṇḍana}}, both of which refer to coming together, rather than disjunction. A particularly instructive case is the following:

\begin{quotation}%
“But there will be three dangers for \textsanskrit{Pāṭaliputta}: fire, water, and (\textit{\textsanskrit{vā}}) internal dissension.”\footnote{\textit{\textsanskrit{Pāṭaliputtassa} kho, \textsanskrit{ānanda}, tayo \textsanskrit{antarāyā} bhavissanti – aggito \textsanskrit{vā} udakato \textsanskrit{vā} abbhantarato \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{mithubhedā}.} } (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali\#28.8.9}{Kd~6:28.8.9})

%
\end{quotation}

Here the text is specific that there will be three dangers and so the \textit{\textsanskrit{vā}}, “or”, cannot mean that only one of the three alternatives will occur. At the same time, it seems unlikely that the three should be seen as happening simultaneously, which may explain why \textit{ca}, “and”, is not used. It follows that \textit{\textsanskrit{vā}} here should most likely be understood conjunctively in the sense of all three occurring, but not conjunctively in the sense of happening simultaneously.

Another striking example of the same phenomenon is found in the \textsanskrit{Ānāpānassati} Sutta. Here is the relevant extract in Pali, followed by a translation, rendering \textit{\textsanskrit{vā}} as “or”:

\begin{quotation}%
\textit{\textsanskrit{Dīghaṁ} \textbf{\textsanskrit{vā}} assasanto \textsanskrit{dīghaṁ} \textsanskrit{assasāmīti} \textsanskrit{pajānāti}, \textsanskrit{dīghaṁ} \textbf{\textsanskrit{vā}} passasanto \textsanskrit{dīghaṁ} \textsanskrit{passasāmīti} \textsanskrit{pajānāti}; \textsanskrit{rassaṁ} \textbf{\textsanskrit{vā}} assasanto \textsanskrit{rassaṁ} \textsanskrit{assasāmīti} \textsanskrit{pajānāti}, \textsanskrit{rassaṁ} \textbf{\textsanskrit{vā}} passasanto \textsanskrit{rassaṁ} \textsanskrit{passasāmīti} \textsanskrit{pajānāti}.}

%
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}%
“When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ \textbf{Or} when breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ \textbf{Or} when breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ \textbf{Or} when breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’” (\href{https://suttacentral.net/mn118/en/sujato\#18.1}{MN~118:18.1})

%
\end{quotation}

Clearly, one does not either know the breathing in or the breathing out. Rather, one first knows one, then the other, alternating between the two. Once again, the use of the \textit{\textsanskrit{vā}} makes the point that the two actions do not happen simultaneously. To make the same point in English one would have to render the \textit{\textsanskrit{vā}} as “and”, or one could simply drop it altogether:

\begin{quotation}%
“When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ When breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’”

%
\end{quotation}

Both of the above examples are exact parallels to the situation in the present \textit{\textsanskrit{pārājika}} rule. In this rule we have eight factors, all of which need to be fulfilled, but not at the same time. Based on this precedent, and the explanation found in the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga}, I believe it is only reasonable to render \textit{\textsanskrit{vā}} as “and” also in Bi Pj 8.

Finally, I am told that \textit{ca} and \textit{\textsanskrit{vā}} are so similar in Sinhala characters that they are often confused when manuscripts are copied. In fact, this phenomenon is known to the commentaries:

\begin{quotation}%
For recently, in some places in the written book the word \textit{\textsanskrit{vā}} is seen, but also the word \textit{ca}.\footnote{\textsanskrit{Sīlakkhandhavagga}-\textsanskrit{Abhinavaṭīkā}, 166: \textit{\textsanskrit{Adhunā} hi katthaci potthake \textsanskrit{vā}-saddo, ca-saddopi dissati}. My thanks to Ven. \textsanskrit{Dhammānando} who kindly provided me with this information. }

\subsection*{\textit{\textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{pācittiya}} 54}

This rule is very similar to \textit{bhikkhu \textsanskrit{pācittiya}} 35, except for two things: (1) it uses the word \textit{\textsanskrit{nimantitā}} (“invited”) in place of \textit{\textsanskrit{bhuttāvī}} (“eaten”); and (2), it adds a \textit{\textsanskrit{vā}}, “or”, which at first glance seems out of place. Here are the two rules for easy reference:

\begin{quotation}%
“If a nun, who has been invited to a meal (\textit{\textsanskrit{nimantitā}}), refuses an offer to eat more (\textit{\textsanskrit{pavāritā}}), and then eats fresh or cooked food, she commits an offense entailing confession.”\footnote{The two relevant \textit{\textsanskrit{vās}}, “ors”, can be seen here: \textit{\textsanskrit{Yā} pana \textsanskrit{bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{nimantitā} \textbf{\textsanskrit{vā}} \textsanskrit{pavāritā} \textbf{\textsanskrit{vā}} \textsanskrit{khādanīyaṁ} \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{bhojanīyaṁ} \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{khādeyya} \textsanskrit{vā} \textsanskrit{bhuñjeyya} \textsanskrit{vā}, \textsanskrit{pācittiyanti}}. } (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc54/en/brahmali\#1.20.1}{Bi~Pc~54})

%
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}%
“If a monk has finished his meal (\textit{\textsanskrit{bhuttāvī}}) and refused an invitation to eat more (\textit{\textsanskrit{pavāritā}}), and then eats fresh or cooked food that is not left over, he commits an offense entailing confession.” (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35/en/brahmali\#2.15.1}{Bu~Pc~35})

%
\end{quotation}

The origin story to \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc54/en/brahmali\#1.1}{Bi~Pc~54} is practically identical to the one at \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35/en/brahmali\#1.1}{Bu~Pc~35}, and in both stories the word \textit{\textsanskrit{bhuttāvī}} is used together with \textit{\textsanskrit{pavārita}}. In the \textit{bhikkhu} rule, \textit{\textsanskrit{bhuttāvī}} is then taken into the rule, but not in the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} rule, where it is replaced by \textit{\textsanskrit{nimantitā}}. The significance of this difference, even whether there is one, is by no means clear.

One solution is to regard \textit{\textsanskrit{nimantitā}} and \textit{\textsanskrit{bhuttāvī}} as synonyms or near-synonyms. If so, then instead of two different situations in which the present rule is breached (\textit{\textsanskrit{nimantitā}} or \textit{\textsanskrit{pavāritā}}), there is only one, which is what we have in the \textit{bhikkhu} rule. Yet this is not quite satisfactory given the non-offense clause of Bi Pc 54, according to which there is no offense if you have been \textit{\textsanskrit{nimantitā}} but not \textit{\textsanskrit{pavāritā}}.

An alternative solution is to understand \textit{\textsanskrit{vā}} as “and”, as it must in \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{pārājika}} 8, instead of as “or”. In fact, the \textsanskrit{Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī} commentary has this to say:

\begin{quotation}%
In the fourth rule (that is, the present rule) \textit{\textsanskrit{nimantitā}} is to be understood by the method spoken of in the rule on group meals (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc32/en/brahmali\#8.15.1}{Bu~Pc~32}); and \textit{\textsanskrit{pavāritā}} is to be understood by the method spoken of in the rule on invitation (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc35/en/brahmali\#2.15.1}{Bu~Pc~35}).\footnote{\textit{Catutthe \textsanskrit{gaṇabhojane} vuttanayena \textsanskrit{nimantitā}, \textsanskrit{pavāraṇāsikkhāpade} vuttanayena \textsanskrit{pavāritā} \textsanskrit{veditabbā}.} }

%
\end{quotation}

At Bu Pc 32, \textit{nimantita} is used to signify that one has been invited to a meal. In contrast to \textit{\textsanskrit{pavārita}}, it is not used to indicate an offer to eat specific foods. \textit{Nimantita} is thus something that happens before one arrives to a meal offering, whereas \textit{\textsanskrit{pavārita}}, as used in Bu Pc 35, indicates an offering of food into one’s hands, specifically a refusal of such food.

On this understanding the two words are not synonymous, but instead a sequence of actions. This fits with the non-offense clause of the present rule, where there is no offense if one has simply been invited, but \emph{not} refused an offer to eat more (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc54/en/brahmali\#2.2.7}{Bi~Pc~54:2.2.7}). Here the two actions are clearly separate. To bring this out in translation, however, necessitates rendering \textit{\textsanskrit{vā}} as “and”, as in Bi Pj 8, for which see the discussion above. To my mind, this is the best solution to the present conundrum, and I translate accordingly.

It is not at all implausible that the difficulty with interpreting the present rule is a result of corruption. According to private communication from Ven. \textsanskrit{Vimalañāṇī}, a number of the other schools of Buddhism have this rule as shared between the \textit{bhikkhus} and \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}}, which means that the wording of the rules is the same. Specifically, the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunī}} rule has the equivalent of the Pali \textit{\textsanskrit{bhuttāvī}} and \textit{\textsanskrit{pavāritā}}, rather than \textit{\textsanskrit{nimantitā}} and \textit{\textsanskrit{pavāritā}}.

Here are the details for the individual schools as told by Ven. \textsanskrit{Vimalañāṇī}. The \textsanskrit{Lokuttaravādins} (extant text in Sanskrit), the \textsanskrit{Mahīśāsakas}, and the \textsanskrit{Mūlasarvāstivādins} (both with extant texts in Chinese) all have the equivalent of \textit{\textsanskrit{bhuttāvī}} instead of \textit{\textsanskrit{pavāritā}}. For the \textsanskrit{Mahāsaṅghikas} (extant text in Chinese), the \textit{bhikkhus} and \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}} have a shared rule that is closer to \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pc36/en/brahmali\#1.28.1}{Bi~Pc~36} of the Pali, which again means that its reading would have been \textit{\textsanskrit{bhuttāvī}}, not \textit{\textsanskrit{nimantitā}}. For the Dharmaguptakas, the \textit{\textsanskrit{bhikkhunīs}} have a rule that is not held in common with the \textit{bhikkhus}, but the reading of the Chinese once again suggests the original was \textit{\textsanskrit{bhuttāvī}}. Given this strong preference for \textit{\textsanskrit{bhuttāvī}} in all schools apart from the Pali, it seems quite possible that the Pali text has been corrupted.

\subsection*{\textit{\textsanskrit{Bhikkhunī} \textsanskrit{pācittiya}} 81}

Here is the rule:

\begin{quotation}%
“If, when a given consent has expired (\textit{\textsanskrit{pārivāsikachandadānena}}), a nun gives the full admission to a trainee nun, she commits an offense entailing confession.” (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pc81/en/brahmali\#1.13.1}{Bi~Pc~81})

%
\end{quotation}

The main problem here is the meaning of \textit{\textsanskrit{pārivāsikachandadānena}}. The latter part of the compound, \textit{\textsanskrit{chandadānena}}, most likely means, “by the giving of consent”, or “by the passing on of consent”, referring to the consent passed on by monastics who are not present at a legal procedure of the Sangha (see Bhikkhu Sujato, “Bhikkhuni Vinaya Studies”, pp. 205–210). The first part of the compound, \textit{\textsanskrit{pārivāsika}}, is trickier. This is what the commentaries say:

\begin{quotation}%
Again, the monks are seated, thinking, “We will do a legal procedure, such as a rehabilitation, etc.,” but then a monk who is an expert in constellations says, “Today the constellations are inauspicious; don’t do this procedure.” Because of his statement, they withdraw their consent (\textit{\textsanskrit{chandaṁ} \textsanskrit{vissajjetvā}}), but remain seated. Then another monk arrives and says: “What is beneficial is lost for the fool who honors constellations. Why worry about constellations?” This is expired consent and expired intention. With this sort of outdatedness, if one does not convey consent and purity anew, it is not allowable to do the procedure.\footnote{Sp 2.1167: \textit{Puna \textsanskrit{bhikkhū} “\textsanskrit{kiñcideva} \textsanskrit{abbhānādisaṅghakammaṁ} \textsanskrit{karissāmā}”ti \textsanskrit{nisinnā} honti, tatreko \textsanskrit{nakkhattapāṭhako} bhikkhu \textsanskrit{evaṁ} vadati – “ajja \textsanskrit{nakkhattaṁ} \textsanskrit{dāruṇaṁ}, \textsanskrit{mā} \textsanskrit{imaṁ} \textsanskrit{kammaṁ} \textsanskrit{karothā}”ti. Te tassa vacanena \textsanskrit{chandaṁ} \textsanskrit{vissajjetvā} tattheva \textsanskrit{nisinnā} honti. \textsanskrit{Athañño} \textsanskrit{āgantvā} “\textsanskrit{nakkhattaṁ} \textsanskrit{paṭimānentaṁ} attho \textsanskrit{bālaṁ} \textsanskrit{upaccagā}”ti \textsanskrit{vatvā} “\textsanskrit{kiṁ} nakkhattena \textsanskrit{karothā}”ti vadati. \textsanskrit{Idaṁ} \textsanskrit{chandapārivāsiyañceva} \textsanskrit{ajjhāsayapārivāsiyañca}. \textsanskrit{Etasmiṁ} \textsanskrit{pārivāsiye} puna \textsanskrit{chandapārisuddhiṁ} \textsanskrit{anānetvā} \textsanskrit{kammaṁ} \textsanskrit{kātuṁ} na \textsanskrit{vaṭṭati}.} }

%
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}%
\textit{\textsanskrit{Chandaṁ} \textsanskrit{vissajjetvā}}: about this, it is said in the \textsanskrit{Anugaṇṭhipada}: “This \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghakamma}} is not to be done today. Having said, ‘(Do it) at your convenience’, (the consent) is given …”\footnote{Vjb 2.1166: \textit{\textsanskrit{Chandaṁ} \textsanskrit{vissajjetvāti} ettha \textsanskrit{anugaṇṭhipade} \textsanskrit{evaṁ} \textsanskrit{vuttaṁ} “\textsanskrit{idaṁ} \textsanskrit{kammaṁ} ajja na \textsanskrit{kattabbaṁ}. ‘\textsanskrit{Yathāsukha}’nti \textsanskrit{vatvā} \textsanskrit{vissajjitaṁ} hoti …}”. }

%
\end{quotation}

This interpretation, however, seems strained and artificial. Consent is normally given by those who cannot be present at a particular meeting, not as suggested here, by an entire group of people who may or may not be present at an unspecified future meeting. I prefer to interpret this rule to refer to the consent that has been given prior to a particular ordination ceremony. If the ceremony is postponed—which is defined in the \textsanskrit{Vibhaṅga} as the “assembly having risen” —then that consent is no longer valid for any new ceremony happening later. Renewed consent is required for the postponed ordination.

It would seem strange, however, to limit this regulation to ordination ceremonies. It is reasonable to think it should apply to all \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghakamma}}. We do, in fact, see indications of this elsewhere in the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka}. At Kd 2 and Kd 4 we find the following regulations:

\begin{quotation}%
“You shouldn’t do the observance-day ceremony with a passed-on purity that has expired (\textit{\textsanskrit{pārivāsikapārisuddhidānena}}), except if the gathering is still seated together.” (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd2/en/brahmali\#36.4.1}{Kd~2:36.4.1})

%
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}%
“You shouldn’t do the invitation ceremony with a passed-on invitation that has expired (\textit{\textsanskrit{pārivāsikapavāraṇādānena}}), except if the gathering is still seated together.” (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd4/en/brahmali\#14.4.1}{Kd~4:14.4.1})

%
\end{quotation}

The two compounds here given in Pali are the same as the one we have discussed above, except that \textit{chanda} is replaced by \textit{\textsanskrit{pārisuddhi}} and by \textit{\textsanskrit{pavāraṇā}} respectively. Both of these situations parallel what we have seen earlier, namely, that neither the observance-day ceremony not the invitation ceremony should be done if a previously given consent has expired, as explained above. Given three instances of the same principle applied to a variety of \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅghakamma}}, we can infer it pertains to all legal procedures.

\section*{The Translator}

Bhikkhu Brahmali was born Norway in 1964. He first became interested in Buddhism and meditation in his early 20s after a visit to Japan. Having completed degrees in engineering and finance, he began his monastic training as an anagarika (keeping the eight precepts) in England at Amaravati and Chithurst Buddhist Monastery.

After hearing teachings from Ajahn Brahm he decided to travel to Australia to train at Bodhinyana Monastery. Bhikkhu Brahmali has lived at Bodhinyana Monastery since 1994, and was ordained as a Bhikkhu, with Ajahn Brahm as his preceptor, in 1996. In 2015 he entered his 20th Rains Retreat as a fully ordained monastic and received the title Maha Thera (Great Elder).

Bhikkhu Brahmali’s knowledge of the Pali language and of the Suttas is excellent. Bhikkhu Bodhi, who translated most of the Pali Canon into English for Wisdom Publications, called him one of his major helpers for the 2012 translation of \emph{The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha}. He has also published two essays on Dependent Origination and a book called \emph{The Authenticity of the Early Buddhist Texts} with the Buddhist Publication Society in collaboration with Bhante Sujato.

The monastics of the Buddhist Society of WA (BSWA) often turn to him to clarify Vinaya (monastic discipline) or Sutta questions. They also greatly appreciate his Sutta and Pali classes. Furthermore he has been instrumental in most of the building and maintenance projects at Bodhinyana Monastery and at the emerging Hermit Hill property in Serpentine.

\section*{Creation Process}

Translated from the Pali. The primary source was the \textsanskrit{Mahāsaṅgīti} edition, with occasional reference to other Pali editions, especially the \textsanskrit{Chaṭṭha} \textsanskrit{Saṅgāyana} edition and the Pali Text Society edition. I cross-checked with I.B. Horner’s English translation, “The Book of the Discipline”, as well as Bhikkhu \textsanskrit{Ñāṇatusita}’s “A Translation and Analysis of the \textsanskrit{Pātimokkha}” and Ajahn \textsanskrit{Ṭhānissaro}’s “Buddhist Monastic Code”.

\section*{The Translation}

This is the first complete translation of the Vinaya \textsanskrit{Piṭaka} in English. The aim has been to produce a translation that is easy to read, clear, and accurate, and also modern in vocabulary and style.
