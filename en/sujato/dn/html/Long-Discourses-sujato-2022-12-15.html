<h1>The SuttaCentral Editions Series</h1>
<p>Since 2005 SuttaCentral has provided access to the texts, translations, and parallels of early Buddhist texts. In 2018 we started creating and publishing our own translations of these seminal spiritual classics. The “Editions” series now makes selected translations available as books in various forms, including print, PDF, and EPUB.</p>
<p>Editions are selected from our most complete, well-crafted, and reliable translations. They aim to bring these texts to a wider audience in forms that reward mindful reading. Care is taken with every detail of the production, and we aim to meet or exceed professional best standards in every way. These are the core scriptures underlying the entire Buddhist tradition, and we believe that they deserve to be preserved and made available in highest quality without compromise.</p>
<p>SuttaCentral is a charitable organization. Our work is accomplished by volunteers and through the generosity of our donors. Everything we create is offered to all of humanity free of any copyright or licensing restrictions. </p>

<h1>Preface to <em>Long Discourses</em></h1>
<p>I grew up in Perth, Western Australia. It’s a city that is often described as “nice”, a somewhat backhanded compliment. The weather is bright and sunny, it’s safe and prosperous, life is good. But it’s not a place where anything particularly happens. Certainly not anything meaningful or interesting to anyone outside of Perth.</p>
<p>As a musician, I would sing songs about New York, about Paris, about Memphis or Singapore or even Darlinghurst. I didn’t know those places, but I knew that they were meaningful places, places deserving of a song. My own life, by contrast, seemed entirely on the surface. The bright sun and clear skies of Perth had no poetry, it banished all the shadows, everything was just so bland. There was nothing to sing about.</p>
<p>You’re sensing a plot twist coming up, and you’re right. In those days—the early 80s—the Perth indie music scene produced its finest band, the Triffids. The singer Dave McComb wrote about things that had happened to me: “he swam out to the edge of the reef, there were cuts along his skin.” I knew what that was like, not because someone had told me, but because I’d done it myself. Suddenly I was living in a world of meaning. I realized that my place, and therefore my life, was just as real and just as meaningful as anything else. The bleaching light of Perth was its meaning, the lack of shadows was its shadow.</p>
<p>When I came to Buddhism, it all seemed so exotic, so distant. I was made to chant in this strange language “Pali”, which I’d never even heard of. It took me a while to even realize that Pali really was an actual language, not just a mystical invocation. The monks I met were strange and incomprehensible: who would choose such a life? It had a depth that made my own paltry life pale in comparison.</p>
<p>As I began to study Buddhism in depth, grappling with deep matters, I discovered a range of other scholars and practitioners to learn from. There were the meditation masters of the Thai forest tradition in which I had ordained—Ajahn Chah, Ajahn Mun, Ajahn Thate, Ajahn Lee Dhammadharo. I grew to find sustenance also in the great scholar-monks of the modern Theravada—Venerables Ñāṇatiloka, Ñāṇapoṇika, Ñāṇamoḷī, Guṇaratana, Bodhi, Narada, Kaṭukurunde Ñāṇananda, Buddhadasa, and many others. I struggled to learn the broader history and nature of the Buddhist schools and traditions from scholars such as I.B. Horner, T.W. Rhys Davids, A.K. Warder and Étienne Lamotte. The knowledge and understanding of all these people seemed so lofty, so confident and capable. I devoured everything I could get my hands on.</p>
<p>It never really occurred to me that I might have something to add. I could hardly even manage to master the basics. The masters of the Buddhist tradition appeared as peerless savants, holders of an ancient and impenetrable wisdom.</p>
<p>If you’re sensing another plot twist, you’re right again. Around 1994 I was still a young resident at Wat Nanachat in north-east Thailand when we received a guest, an elderly English gentleman who introduced himself as Maurice Walshe. Of course I knew that name very well: he had translated the Dīgha Nikāya. I was so excited to meet one of my heroes. He was a charming and witty man, and it was an honor for me to meet him and spend some time together. I am always grateful to him because he made me realize that the Buddhist tradition was created and formed by ordinary people. He had studied Pali, but did not regard himself as an accomplished scholar. He undertook the translation at the behest of Venerable Ānandamaitreya—another figure of legend for me. Maurice was very humble about his abilities and his achievement. And it was no false modesty; while his translation was eminently readable, it was not especially accurate. But he did it. And in doing so, helped the Dhamma take one more step forward.</p>
<p>It was after meeting Rod Bucknell and John Kelly, the co-founders of SuttaCentral, in 2004, that I started making my own contributions to the Dhamma through SuttaCentral. Modest as they were, I realized that my talents and skills could help others, as I had been helped. It took a long while, much learning and many trials, but eventually I dared imagine that maybe I could make my own contribution to the corpus of Pali translations. It would surely be imperfect and inadequate, but perhaps I had something to give.</p>
<p>Those of us who have enjoyed the sweet taste of the Dhamma owe a debt of gratitude to all those who have made it possible; to all the teachers, the supporters, the donors, the monks and nuns and layfolk, the scholars, the meditators, the builders and cooks and plumbers and weavers, the artists and storytellers, the repairers of leaky roofs and the kindlers of lamps. There is not a single one who has the capacity to hold the whole tradition. But I believe that there is not a single one who has nothing to offer.</p>
<p>Allow me to indulge in a further recollection of my days in the indie music scene. One of the songs that has stuck with me is <i>Song of the Siren</i>, written by Tim Buckley, but known from the version by This Mortal Coil. In three short verses it tells the story of the protagonist lost on “shipless oceans”, who was drawn in and given shelter by one they came to love. Just as they thought they were safe, the beloved seemed to turn away, leaving them “broken lovelorn on your rocks”. Despairing and confused, they considered ending it all. Until at last, they realized: now it was their turn. They could not live forever relying on the other to offer shelter and protection. When they were lost, they had been saved, and now they called to the other, “swim to me, let me enfold you”.</p>
<p>As a person of faith, I believe that the Buddha was a perfected human being. The Buddhist tradition, on the other hand, is made up of people who are usually notably imperfect. Sometimes we feel inspiration and uplift, other times disappointment or disillusionment. I reached a point of frustration when I knew that, for all the efforts of many people, we were still not able to make all the Suttas available in translation for free. It seemed wrong, and I didn’t know what to do. It was then that I realized that it was my turn to offer shelter.</p>

<p>The suttas of the Pali Canon (Tipiṭaka), especially the four main <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i>, are essential reading for anyone who wishes to understand the Buddha and his teaching. They have been preserved and passed down in the Pali language by the Theravāda tradition of Buddhism as the word of the Buddha.</p>
<p>These texts were originally passed down orally, by generations of monks and nuns who memorized them and recited them together. Around 30 BCE they were written down in the Āluvihāra in Sri Lanka, and subsequently were transmitted in manuscripts of palm leaves.</p>
<p>From the 19th century, the manuscripts were edited and published as modern editions in sets of books. In addition, the Pali text was translated into a number of modern languages, including Thai, Burmese, Sinhalese, and English.</p>
<p>The word Tipiṭaka means “Three Baskets”. The Basket of Discourses is traditionally listed as the second of the three. The four <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i> make up the bulk of the Basket of Discourses. Here is how they are situated within the canon as a whole.</p>
<ul>
<li>Vinaya Piṭaka (Basket of Monastic Law)</li>
<li>
Sutta Piṭaka (Basket of Discourses)
<ul>
<li><b>Dīgha Nikāya</b> (Long Discourses)</li>
<li><b>Majjhima Nikāya</b> (Middle Discourses)</li>
<li><b>Saṁyutta Nikāya</b> (Linked Discourses)</li>
<li><b>Aṅguttara Nikāya</b> (Numbered Discourses)</li>
<li>Khuddaka Nikāya (Minor Discourses)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Abhidhamma Piṭaka (Basket of Systematic Treatises)</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar collections are found in ancient Chinese translations, and substantial portions of them are also in Sanskrit and Tibetan. The diverse collections of scriptures arose among the Buddhist communities who spread across greater India in the centuries following the Buddha, especially under the Buddhist emperor, Ashoka. These missions are documented in the ancient chronicles of Sri Lanka as well as the Vinaya commentaries in Pali and Chinese, and have been partially corroborated by modern archaeology.</p>
<p>SuttaCentral hosts almost all of these texts and provides comprehensive parallels showing the relations between them. A comparative understanding based on the full spectrum of these texts is essential for any study of early Buddhism. The Chinese Buddhist canon, in particular, contains a vast amount of translations of early texts, and in terms of quantity it outweighs the Pali texts by some margin.</p>
<p>For many reasons, though, the Pali texts will always retain a special place for those who wish to understand what the Buddha taught.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are the only complete set of scriptures of an early school of Buddhism.</li>
<li>They are by far the largest body of texts to survive in an early Indic dialect.</li>
<li>They are accompanied by an extensive and detailed set of ancient commentaries (<i lang="pli" translate="no">aṭṭhakathā</i>).</li>
<li>They are, for the most part, linguistically clear, well-edited, and readily comprehensible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, the Pali texts are the core scriptures of a living tradition, the Theravāda school found in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Myanmar, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Laos, India, China, and Vietnam. To this day they are recited, taught, studied, and practiced daily, and are regarded in the traditions as being a reliable witness to the teachings of the Buddha himself.</p>
<p>Among the Pali texts, it is the four <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i> that command the most attention. It is here that we find extensive and definitive explanations of Buddhist teachings, as well as the living personality of the Buddha and his immediate disciples.</p>
<p>By comparison, the Vinaya Piṭaka details the life of the monastic communities, and in addition it reveals much about the history and social background; but it contains only a few teaching passages. The Abhidhamma Piṭaka is made up of systematic treatises that were composed in the centuries following the Buddha’s passing. And the books of the Khuddaka Nikāya are very mixed. There are six fairly short books that are supplements to the main four <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i>, mostly in verse: the <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dhp">Dhammapada</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/ud">Udāna</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/iti">Itivuttaka</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/snp">Sutta Nipāta</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/thag">Theragāthā</a>, and <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/thig">Therīgāthā</a>. However, most of the other books in the Khuddaka are later, and represent a phase of Buddhism a few centuries after the Buddha.</p>
<h2 id="general-item1">About These Guides</h2>
<p>I have prepared these guides in order to support a student who wishes to develop a deeper understanding of the <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i>. They accompany my translations of the four <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i> as found on SuttaCentral. This general guide is meant to be read first, as it covers a variety of issues that are common to all the <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i>. The four <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i> are a highly unified body of texts, sharing most of the significant doctrinal passages. The general information presented here is fleshed out in individual essays on each of the four <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i>, which highlight the shifts in emphasis and orientation from one collection to the next. These may be read in any order. While the guides for the specific <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i> naturally focus on the texts in that <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāya</i>, this is not adhered to rigidly, and they may refer also to passages found elsewhere.</p>
<p>Summaries of major doctrinal themes may be found mostly in the <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāya</i> guides, especially that for the Saṁyutta Nikāya, rather than here. However, I would urge a degree of caution when it comes to summaries, including my own. The true joy of the suttas is in the undigested teachings, in that raw moment when the Buddha encounters a person in suffering and helps them, not by giving them a digested abstract, but by reaching out to them as people. Summaries and surveys are best treated as starting points for discovery, rather than as definitive treatises.</p>
<p>I almost completely avoid sideways glances at the various Chinese and other parallels. Understanding these relations is critical, and the entire basis of SuttaCentral is founded on this fact. But the number of texts is very large, and the complexity of the subject is daunting. I fear that if I were to deal with parallels in any kind of depth, these essays would never be completed; and if they were, they would have become unreadably complex. Hence I have set myself a more manageable scope, sticking to the Pali texts, on the understanding that most things probably apply to the parallels as well. The reader can easily check the parallels on SuttaCentral if they wish.</p>
<p>Among students of the suttas, the names of these collections are often abbreviated to “Dīgha”, “Majjhima”, and so on, just as the word “Sutta” is often omitted from sutta titles. Strictly speaking, it’d be best to use the Pali title when referring to the original text, and the translated title when referring to the translation; but this distinction is often overlooked.</p>
<h2 id="general-item2">An Approachable Translation</h2>
<p>In 2015 I determined to create freely available translations of the main Pali discourses, so that all of these teachings might be made freely available in a clear, consistent, and accurate rendition. My aim was to translate the four main <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i> as well as the 6 early books of the Khuddaka Nikāya: Theragāthā, Therīgāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Dhammapada, and Suttanipāta. I did this so that these astonishing works of ancient spiritual insight might enjoy the wider audience they so richly deserve.</p>
<p>In considering my translation style, I reflected on the standard trope that introduces the prose suttas: a person “approaches” the Buddha to ask a question or hear a teaching. It’s one of those passages that became so standard that we usually just pass it by. But it is no small thing to “approach” a spiritual teacher. It takes time, effort, curiosity, and courage; many of those people would have been more than a little nervous.</p>
<p>How, then, would the Buddha respond when approached? Would he have been archaic and obscure? Would he use words in odd, alienating ways? Would you need to have another monk by your side, whispering notes into your ear every second sentence—“He said this; but what he really meant was…”?</p>
<p>I think not. I think that the Buddha would have spoken clearly, kindly, and with no more complication than was necessary. I think that he would have respected the effort that people made to “approach” his teachings, and he would have tried the best he could, given the limitations of language and comprehension, to explain the Dhamma so that people could understand it.</p>
<p>An approachable translation expresses the meaning of the text in a manner that is simple, friendly, and idiomatic. It should not just be technically correct, it should sound like something someone might actually say.</p>
<p>Which means that it should strive to dispense entirely with the formalisms, technicalities, and Indic idioms that has dominated Buddhist translations, into which English has been coerced by translators who were writing for Indologists, linguists, and Buddhist philosophers. Such translations are a death by a thousand papercuts; with each obscurity the reader is distanced, taken out of the text, pushed into a mode of acting on the text, rather than being drawn into it.</p>
<p>That is not how those who listened to the Buddha would have experienced it. They were not being annoyed by the grit of dubious diction, nor were they being constantly nagged to check the footnotes. They were drawn inwards and upwards, fully experiencing the transformative power of the Dhamma as it came to life in the words of the Awakened One. We cannot hope to recapture this experience fully; but at least we can try to not make things worse than they need to be.</p>
<p>At each step of the way I asked myself, “Would an ordinary person, with little or no understanding of Buddhism, be able to read this and understand what it is actually saying?” To this end, I have favored the simpler word over the more complex; the direct phrasing rather than the oblique; the active voice rather than the passive; the informal rather than the formal; and the explicit rather than the implicit.</p>
<p>Still, it should not be thought that these are loose adaptations or simplifications. There is a place for re-imaginings of ancient texts, and for versions that strip the complexity to focus on the main point. But my work is intended as a full and accurate translation, one that omits nothing of substance. It is just that I try to express this without undue complexity.</p>
<p>I still feel I am a long way from achieving my goal. No-one is more aware than the translator of the compromises and losses along the way. Consistency, clarity, correctness, and beauty all make their competing claims, and only rarely, it seems, can all be met. It is a work in progress, and I will probably be making corrections and adjustments for many years to come.</p>
<p>I have been especially influenced in this approach by my fellow monks, Ajahn Brahm and Ajahn Brahmali. It is from Ajahn Brahm that I have learned the virtue of plain English; of the kindness of speaking such that people actually understand. And with Ajahn Brahmali, who has been working on Vinaya translations at the same time, I have had many illuminating discussions about the meaning of various words and phrases. He said one thing that stuck in my mind: a translation should mean <em>something</em>. Even if you’re not sure what the text means, we can be sure that it had some meaning, so to translate it based purely on lexical correspondences is to not really translate it at all. Say what you think the text means, and if you make a mistake, fix it.</p>
<h2 id="general-item3">Plan Your Route or Wander in the Garden</h2>
<p>The Buddha’s teaching is a graduated one, leading from simple principles to profound realizations. This pattern is found within almost all of the discourses in one way or another. However it does <em>not</em> apply to the collections of discourses. From collection to collection or discourse to discourse there is no graduation in difficulty, no build up of assumed knowledge in the student.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the Dīgha Nikāya begins with the Brahmajala Sutta, while the Majjhima Nikāya begins with the Mūlapariyāya Sutta, both of which are among the most profound and difficult discourses in the whole canon. A student who dives in unwarily will suddenly find themselves in very deep waters indeed.</p>
<p>If we wish to build up knowledge step by step, we can’t rely on simply reading the suttas in order. Students often find it helpful to use a structured reading guide such as that offered here. On SuttaCentral, we offer several other approaches.</p>
<p>Having said which, there’s nothing wrong with simply plunging in at random, so long as you don’t expect everything to make sense at first. Take your time and enjoy wandering about. Don’t worry too much about things that seem odd or unexpected. Usually you’ll find that obscure or difficult ideas are explained somewhere else; discovering those unexpected connections is one of the joys of reading the suttas.</p>
<p>In these introductory essays, you will find many references to the suttas. You don’t need to look up each reference to understand the essays. But if you do, you will get a reasonable survey of many important texts, and learn how to find the passage that you need. I suggest reading each essay on its own first, and then a second time, looking up and reading the sutta references as you go.</p>
<h2 id="general-item4">Looking Up References</h2>
<p>When you delve into sutta reading, you’ll notice that texts and passages are referenced in sometimes confusing ways. On SuttaCentral we employ a simple and widely adopted form of semantic referencing. By “semantic” references, we mean that the reference numbers are based on meaningful divisions in the texts themselves.</p>
<p>For the four <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i>, this means:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Dīgha and Majjhima, texts are referenced by the ID for the collection (DN and MN respectively) and the sutta number, counted in a simple sequence from the beginning.</li>
<li>In the Saṁyutta, the collection ID (SN), <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i> (thematic group), and sutta.</li>
<li>In the Aṅguttara, the collection ID (AN), <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i> (numerical group), and sutta.</li>
</ul>
<p>More granular referencing is provided by section numbers. These follow pre-existing conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the Dīgha, the section numbers of the PTS Pali edition, which have been widely adopted in translations.</li>
<li>In the Majjhima, the section numbers introduced by Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoḷi, and used in Bhikkhu Bodhi’s edition.</li>
<li>In the Saṁyutta and Aṅguttara, the paragraph numbers as found in the Mahāsaṅgīti Pali text.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these is further subdivided so that each section contains a number of “segments”, a short piece of text usually about a sentence or so long. In my translations, the segments are matched with the underlying Pali text.</p>
<p>In our system, the numbers following a colon represent the section and segment numbers, that is, the subdivisions within a sutta. So, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>DN 3 means “the third discourse in the collection of Long Discourses (Dīgha Nikāya)”.</li>
<li>MN 43:3 means “discourse 43, section 3 in the collection of Middle Discourses (Majjhima Nikāya)”.</li>
<li>MN 43:3.7 means “discourse 43, section 3, segment 7 in the collection of Middle Discourses (Majjhima Nikāya)”.</li>
<li>SN 12.2:6.2 means “discourse 2, section 6, segment 2 in the 12th <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i> of the collection of Linked Discourses (Saṁyutta Nikāya)”.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may encounter various other referencing systems. In academic works, texts are often referenced by volume and page of the Pali Text Society (PTS) edition of the original Pali. This is a regrettable and clumsy convention, since it binds references to a specific paper edition. I hope it is swiftly abandoned in favor of proper semantic references. However, the PTS volume/page numbers are displayed on SuttaCentral in case you need to look up a legacy reference.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the texts were—and often still are—referenced the long way: by <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāya</i>, then <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i> or <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i> and/or <i lang="pli" translate="no">paṇṇasaka</i> (as applicable), then <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> and <i lang="pli" translate="no">sutta</i>. This system is helpful when using manuscripts, as you can narrow your search step by step through the manuscript to find what you need. On the web, or even in books, however, it is unnecessary. Nevertheless, you can use the traditional navigation structure in our sidebar if you wish.</p>
<h2 id="general-item5">Elements of Structure</h2>
<p>As students of Buddhist texts we are interested in the content, in learning what the Buddha and his disciples had to say and how they lived. However, due to the manner in which the texts are arranged, we quickly discover that it’s not easy to know how different texts relate to each other. So while it may seem dry, it is worth spending a little time to consider the <em>structure</em> of the texts.</p>
<p>Early Buddhist texts were organized, not for reading, but for oral recitation and memorization. The overriding concern was to divide the texts into chunks that could be memorized and recited together. Since the texts were preserved in memory, they were largely “random access”: a skilled student could instantly recall a passage from anywhere in the texts, without having to flip through the pages or look up an index. In this way, the earliest system of organization is a little similar to how we find information today through a search engine.</p>
<p>It follows from this that we cannot expect early Buddhist texts to be structured sequentially like a modern book. But this does not mean that the collections are random or chaotic. They follow their own logic, which can be discerned if the texts are approached sympathetically.</p>
<p>Here are some of the structural or formal elements you will encounter in the early Buddhist texts.</p>
<h3>Imagery and Narrative</h3>
<p>The suttas frequently employ an ABA pattern. A statement is made; a simile is given; and the statement is repeated.</p>
<p>This formal pattern is highly effective in reinforcing learning. First we get the basic idea. But abstract philosophical or psychological statements are hard to understand and remember without any context, so the Buddha illuminates his teaching with a simile. He ends by driving the message home once again.</p>
<p>The range of similes in the suttas is truly astounding. The Buddha had an uncanny ability to effortlessly summon an apt comparison from anything that he saw around him. The similes also convey a great deal of incidental detail regarding life and culture in the Buddha’s day, and, more importantly, they show how the Dhamma teaching makes sense in its context. Most of the classic Buddhist images that are familiar today trace their roots to similes used by the Buddha in the early texts.</p>
<p>Sometimes the similes are extended to a brief parable or fable. Curiously enough, however, we rarely see the Buddha engage in story-telling of any length.</p>
<p>Where narratives are developed in some detail, they are typically as part of the background story (<i lang="pli" translate="no">nidāna</i>) rather than in the Buddha’s teaching as such. It is an elementary principle of historical scholarship that the background story is of a somewhat later date than the main doctrinal material. Such stories vary considerably in the parallels, showing that the traditions treated narrative more flexibly than doctrine.</p>
<h3>Repetition</h3>
<p>It won’t take long before you notice that the suttas tend to be repetitious. <em>Very</em> repetitious. This can be a major hurdle for a new reader, so let’s take a little time to consider what is happening.</p>
<p>Like so many patterns found in nature, the repetitions are <em>fractal</em>. That is, they occur at every level: the word, the phrase, the sentence, the paragraph, the passage, the whole text, even the group of texts. This shows that the repetition is not something alien to these texts, not something forced on them by an over-zealous editor, but is intrinsic from the beginning.</p>
<p>But why? The thing to remember is that the texts were formed in an oral tradition. And in an oral tradition, repetition works very differently than it does in writing. When you <em>read</em> a repetition, it can be annoying; it feels like a waste of time, and you want to skip over it. But when <em>reciting</em>, repetition has exactly the opposite effect. It is soothing and relaxing. The parts that are different take more work, you have to exercise your memory; but when the repeated passage comes around—like the chorus of a song—you relax into the flow of the chanting. Repetitions give the reciter space to be at ease and contemplate. Reciting a highly repetitive text becomes a form of meditation, where you reflect the meaning and apply it to your experience as you recite.</p>
<p>But in addition to this spiritual aspect, repetition has a definite practical purpose: preservation. By saying the same thing again and again, identically or with small variations, the reciters were constantly checking their memories, ensuring the accuracy of the texts. And if a text was lost, there is always another similar passage somewhere else. Thus the repetitions ensured the long-term survival of the Dhamma by creating backups of important information in multiple places, retained in the minds of Buddhist practitioners.</p>
<p>Understanding the historical role of repetitions, however, doesn’t help us when we just want to read a sutta. What are we to do? Well, there is no single way to read a sutta. Some people prefer to read them in full, contemplating each repetition. Others read them more briefly, getting to the important point. You’ll figure out a way that suits you. But when you understand the role of repetitions, hopefully you will not find them such an obstruction.</p>
<h3>Abbreviation</h3>
<p>The flipside of repetition is abbreviation. Since the repetitions are so abundant, they are often abbreviated. Such abbreviation is not a modern invention; it is found throughout the manuscripts, and indeed there is no edition that fully spells out all the repetitions. The Pali texts have their own convention for indicating abbreviations, marked with the syllable <i lang="pli" translate="no">pe</i>, itself an abbreviation of <i lang="pli" translate="no">peyyāla</i>.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the abbreviations in the Pali editions, and the occasional instructions on how to spell out the full text, are sensible and fairly consistent between editions. Modern translations follow the manuscript tradition, but not slavishly. Sometimes the translation will spell out abbreviated passages, or else abbreviate passages spelled out in the original.</p>
<p>Abbreviations are both “internal” or “external”. By internal abbreviation, I mean that there is enough information in the text itself to fully reconstruct it. Typically only the first and last items in a list are spelled out in full, and for the rest, only the key terms are mentioned. Here is an example from <a class="ref" href="/sn22.137">SN 22.137</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Form is impermanent; you should give up desire for it. Feeling … Perception … Choices … Consciousness is impermanent; you should give up desire for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In external abbreviations, an abbreviated passage cannot be fully reconstructed from the context, but requires looking up another text to fill in the blanks. This is another example of how the oral tradition differs from written texts. A reciter would obviously know, say, the formula for the four noble truths, so there is no need to write it every time; just enough to jog the memory. But in modern editions, especially on the web, a reader can access a specific text from anywhere, and may never have encountered the abbreviated passage before. For this reason I tried to reduce the number of external abbreviations in my translations.</p>
<h3>Titles</h3>
<p>Buddhist manuscripts rarely have titles at the start like modern texts. Rather, the title is recorded at the end. In modern editions, these titles have been added at the start for clarity.</p>
<p>In many cases, especially in the titles of suttas and <i lang="pli" translate="no">vaggas</i>, what we actually have in the manuscript is not really a title as such, but a key word found in the summary verse (<i lang="pli" translate="no">uddāna</i>) found at the end of a <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> or other division. These verses were inserted by the redactors of the canon in order to help keep the contents organized, much like a Table of Contents. However, the summary verses do vary to some extent between editions, so the titles of suttas are not always consistent. In addition, some suttas are assigned more than one title in the text itself—for example <a class="ref" href="/dn1">DN 1</a> <cite class="text-translated">The Prime Net</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Brahmajalasutta</cite>)—or there are spelling variations. So take care, for it is quite common to find different titles for the same text.</p>
<h3>Textual Divisions</h3>
<h4>Vagga (“Chapter”)</h4>
<p>The <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> is the most widespread and distinctive structural unit in early Buddhist texts. It usually consists of ten texts, which may be ten discourses, ten verses, ten rules, and so on. The number ten is adhered to fairly consistently, although on occasion a <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> may contain more or less than ten.</p>
<p>The <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> is often little more than a convenient grouping to help organize the discourses neatly. In such cases, a <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> is usually just named after its first discourse.</p>
<p>However, it is also common to find that a <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> collects discourses with a loose thematic unity. For example, in the <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn-silakkhandhavagga"><cite class="text-translated">Chapter on the Full Spectrum of Ethics</cite></a> (<cite class="text-root">Sīlakkhandhavagga</cite>) of the Dīgha Nikāya (thirteen discourses in this case), almost all the texts deal with the “gradual training” of ethics, meditation, and wisdom.</p>
<p>In some cases, a <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> in Pali may parallel a similar <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> in another language. For example, the famous <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/snp-atthakavagga"><cite class="text-translated">Chapter of the Eights</cite></a> (<cite class="text-root">Aṭṭhakavagga</cite>) of the Sutta Nipāta exists in Chinese translation, though the Sutta Nipāta as a whole does not. Similarly, the <cite class="text-root">Sīlakkhandhavagga</cite> of the Dīgha Nikāya has parallels in both the Dharmaguptaka (Chinese) and Sarvāstivāda (Sanskrit) texts of the Dīgha.</p>
<p>Occasionally the word <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> is applied to a larger textual unit, one that includes a number of sections, each of which composed of “little” <i lang="pli" translate="no">vaggas</i>. Examples of such nested <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> structures include the Saṁyutta Nikāya and the Khandhakas of the Pali Vinaya.</p>
<h4>Paṇṇāsaka (“Fifty”)</h4>
<p>The word <i lang="pli" translate="no">paṇṇāsa</i> means “fifty”, and a <i lang="pli" translate="no">paṇṇāsaka</i> is a group of approximately fifty suttas, or five <i lang="pli" translate="no">vaggas</i>. It is used to organize collections that contain many <i lang="pli" translate="no">vaggas</i>. Most of the collections with large numbers of discourses use this structure, for example the “<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn-mulapannasa"><cite class="text-translated">Root Fifty</cite></a>” of the Majjhima Nikāya (<cite class="text-root">Mūlapaṇṇāsa</cite>). The <i lang="pli" translate="no">paṇṇāsaka</i> is purely for convenience and does not correspond to any meaningful division of the text.</p>
<h4>Nipāta (“Group”)</h4>
<p>The literal meaning of <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i> is “fallen down”, and it is a generic term for texts that have been placed together. In the Aṅguttara, it is used for each division of texts gathered together by number: the <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1">group of discourses consisting of one item</a>, and so on. Elsewhere it is used, for example, in the title of the <a class="ref" href='https://suttacentral.net/snp" class="text-root'>Sutta Nipāta</a>, the “Group of Discourses”.</p>
<h4>Saṁyutta (“Collection of Linked Discourses”)</h4>
<p>Whereas the <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i> is quite generic, the <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i> has a more specific meaning: texts collected according to a similar theme or subject matter. The Saṁyutta Nikāya consists of 56 such collections. For example, the fourteenth <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i> contains <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn14">39 discourses on the topic of the elements</a>.</p>
<h4>Nikāya or Āgama (“Division”)</h4>
<p>The largest structural unit, usually known as <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāya</i> in the Pali tradition of the Theravāda, and as <i lang="pli" translate="no">āgama</i> in the northern traditions. However, the term <i lang="pli" translate="no">āgama</i>, while it has fallen into disuse in modern Theravāda, is found quite commonly in the Pali commentaries.</p>
<p>Collections similar to the four <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i> as found in the Pali are found in all the other schools. However, while the overall nature of the collections is similar, and they are organized in similar ways, the detailed content varies considerably. It frequently happens that a sutta found in the Majjhima of one school, for example, may be found in the Saṁyutta or Dīgha of another school. In addition, the internal sequence of texts is quite different. Thus it seems that the <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i> or <i lang="pli" translate="no">āgamas</i> functioned more as organizational guidelines than as fixed units.</p>
<p>The fifth Pali <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāya</i>, the Khuddaka Nikāya, is more flexible and varies more between traditions. It seems it originated as a place for collecting verses and minor texts not gathered elsewhere. However the Pali collection became a handy place to include later texts, so it has now become the biggest of all the <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i>. While there are occasional references to a similar collection in the northern schools, none exist in that form today. Nevertheless, many of the individual texts of the Khuddaka have parallels, especially the Dhammapada, which survives in many different editions.</p>
<h2 id="general-item6">In the Buddha’s Day: A Time of Change</h2>
<p>Each discourse begins with a brief statement saying that at “one time” the Buddha was staying at a particular place. In this way the redactors of the texts were concerned to locate the Buddha and his teachings in a specific historical and cultural context. Modern scholars have been able to reconstruct a fairly reliable picture of the Buddha’s life and times, relying on the early Buddhist texts, as well as what information may be gleaned from Brahmanical and Jaina scriptures.</p>
<p>Archeology is, unfortunately, of limited use, as there are few archeological remnants from the Buddha’s day. In fact, before the time of Ashoka—perhaps 150 years after the Buddha—there are very few remains at all of ancient India, until the time of the Indic Valley civilization, many centuries earlier. For the period we are interested in, what has been found consists of some pottery and similar small implements, as well as a few remnants of fortifications around Kosambī. The paucity of evidence is due to two main reasons. The first is that buildings at the time were mostly of wood or other perishable materials. And the second is that archeological work in India has been very spotty and incomplete.</p>
<p>The Buddha lived in the 5th century BCE in the Ganges plain in northern India. The exact dates of his birth and death are uncertain, but modern scholarly opinion tends to place his birth around 480 BCE and his death 80 years later at around 400 BCE. He was born in Lumbini and grew up in Kapilavatthu, both of which belong to the Sakyan republic, straddling the modern border of India and Nepal. His family name was Gotama; the earliest texts do not mention his personal name, but tradition says it was Siddhattha.</p>
<p>After his Awakening, the Buddha traveled about the Gangetic plain. The area he traversed was part of the cultural/political region known as the “sixteen nations” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">janapada</i>). This spanned from modern Delhi to the north-west, the Bangladesh border to the east, the Himalayan foothills to the north, the Deccan to the south, and Ujjain to the south-west. Most of his time was spent around the cities of Sāvatthī in the kingdom of Kosala and Rājagaha in the kingdom of Magadha. Despite the proliferation of local legends in most Buddhist countries, the Buddha never ventured outside this area.</p>
<p>It was not just the Buddha who was restricted to this region. It seems that trade and other close cultural contacts normally took place within this region, too. Occasional references to places further afield—southern India or the Greeks—were vague and often legendary. It was in the century after the Buddha passed away that the kingdoms of northern India were unified and regular international trade routes were opened, first to Europe, and, a couple of centuries later, to south-east Asia and China.</p>
<h2 id="general-item7">Economics and Politics</h2>
<p>Though cities and urban life feature prominently in the texts, they are still on a small scale. The economy was largely rural, with farming playing a prominent role.</p>
<p>However there are lists of occupations in the Pali canon that show a diverse range of employment—accountants, jewelers, builders, soldiers, doctors, government officials, and many more.</p>
<p>The rise in diversity of employment was linked to the growth of cities, which in turn is associated with the appearance of new technologies. The archeological record, though thin, has furnished us with records of two significant innovations: forges for iron, and a kind of fine pottery known as Northern Black Polished Ware. These new developments attest to a growing mastery in the industrial use of fire, something that the suttas mention in several memorable similes.</p>
<p>Technological innovation drove economic growth. We frequently hear of wealthy individuals, employing large staffs and managing properties or businesses. There was enough economic surplus to support a large class of spiritual seekers. Such ascetics made no material contributions to society; their value lay in spiritual and ethical development.</p>
<p>These technological and economic shifts were mirrored in the political sphere. There were two major forms of governance. Traditional clans such as the Sakyans or the Vajjians followed an ancient restricted form of democracy, where decisions were made in a town council, and the clan elected a leading member as temporary ruler. Other nations, like Kosala and Magadha, had formed a more familiar kind of kingdom, with an absolute hereditary monarch. While the Buddha evidently favored the democratic ideals under which he grew up, and after which he modeled the governance of the Sangha, it was the kingdoms that were growing in economic and military dominance. During the Buddha’s lifetime, there were repeated skirmishes between Kosala and Magadha, vying for dominion over the ancient sacred city of Varanasi.</p>
<p>Of even greater significance, towards the end of his life, Magadha was announcing its intentions to invade the Vajjian republic. History attests to the success of this policy: in the decades following the Buddha’s death, Magadha conquered virtually all of the sixteen nations, establishing an unquestioned supremacy over the region, and establishing pan-Indian trade networks. So powerful was the resulting kingdom that Alexander the Great’s troops rebelled at the mere rumor of Magadhan military might.</p>
<h2 id="general-item8">Social Life</h2>
<p>The growing complexity of economic and political life required corresponding changes in social roles and responsibilities. Like any society in a time of change, people in the time of the Buddha were trying to balance their traditional values and structures with the new realities. It seems that people were for the most part reasonably well off. Still, poverty and famine, along with injustice, banditry, and economic uncertainty, were present and posed a very real threat. We hear frequent laments about how unpredictable wealth is, whether the older forms of wealth in cattle and land, or the newer forms in money and career.</p>
<p>The Buddha was not a social revolutionary and did not overtly agitate for an overthrow of social systems, even those he recognized as unjust. Typically he would argue for a more just and fair implementation of existing norms. For example, rather than saying all societies should be democratic, he spoke of the moral duty of a king to look after his people.</p>
<p>A man was expected to earn a living so as to maintain and protect his family. He should use his earnings to provide his family with both essentials and luxuries, and to treat workers with kindness and decency, while not neglecting to assign some funds for savings, and some for donations to charity.</p>
<p>A woman’s traditional role was to marry and bear children. Aside from this, her options were limited. We rarely hear of professional women aside from sex workers. In this context, the opportunity to become a nun allowed women to pursue their own spiritual and intellectual development, to act as leaders and teachers, and to be respected and supported in that role.</p>
<p>Many of the more extreme manifestations of sexual discrimination are not found in the early texts. We find no mention of child brides, immolation of widows, or the essential subjugation of women to men.</p>
<p>India had not yet developed a full-fledged caste system. But there was a much simpler fourfold division of society:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Aristocrats (<i lang="pli" translate="no">khattiya</i>)</dt>
<dd>Owners of land (<i lang="pli" translate="no">khetta</i>), typically wealthy and powerful, engaged in statecraft, war, and production. The Buddha was from an aristocratic clan. The aristocrats placed themselves at the highest tier of society.</dd>
<dt>Brahmins (<i lang="pli" translate="no">brāhmaṇa</i>)</dt>
<dd>Members of a hereditary priestly class. The brahmins were custodians of sacred texts called “Vedas”, and performed rituals and ceremonies to their various deities. However by the time of the Buddha many brahmins were simply engaged in ordinary worldly livelihoods and their religious role was secondary. They believed themselves to be the children of God (Brahmā).</dd>
<dt>Merchants (<i lang="pli" translate="no">vessa</i>):</dt>
<dd>Engaged in trade and commerce.</dd>
<dt>Workers (<i lang="pli" translate="no">sudda</i>)</dt>
<dd>Performed physical labor.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Not everyone fit into this neat scheme. We hear reference to outcastes and various tribal peoples. In addition, there were slaves or bonded servants. Finally, the ascetics (<i lang="pli" translate="no">samaṇa</i>) such as the Buddha saw themselves as having left behind all such notions of caste.</p>
<h2 id="general-item9">The Many Spiritual Paths of Ancient India</h2>
<p>Change in the Buddha’s day was not limited to the worldly sphere. The religious life of ancient India was equally dynamic. For this reason it would be a mistake to assume that India in the time of the Buddha was primarily a Hindu society. Some of the elements that make up modern Hinduism may be discerned, but Indian religion, like spiritual and religious practice everywhere, has always been in a state of flux and evolution.</p>
<p>In the time of the Buddha, and indeed even to this day, the ancient pre-Buddhist Vedas formed the basis for the spiritual life of the brahmins and those who followed them. Rituals such as the <i lang="pli" translate="no">agnihotra</i>, the daily pouring of ghee onto the fire as an offering to the fire-god Agni—originated long before the Aryan people even came to India, and continue to be performed today.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many of the old gods featured in the Vedas had vanished by the time of the Buddha, and many of the famed deities of later Hinduism had not yet appeared. Those who do appear take on a markedly different aspect; prominent gods such as Vishnu (Pali: <i lang="pli" translate="no">Veṇhu</i>) or Shiva (Pali: <i lang="pli" translate="no">Siva</i>) appear in minor roles, and a warrior like Sakka (AKA Indra) appears as an apostle of peace. There were no temples, no images, and no cult of devotion (<i lang="pli" translate="no">bhakti</i>). There is no mention of a system of <i lang="pli" translate="no">avatars</i>, nor of familiar concepts from modern Hindu-inspired spirituality such as <i lang="pli" translate="no">śakti</i>, <i lang="pli" translate="no">kuṇḍalinī</i>, chakras, or yoga exercises.</p>
<p>Moreover, when we look at the aspects of modern Hinduism that were present at the time, many of them are completely separate from each other. No-one considered, for example, the worship of a local dragon (<i lang="pli" translate="no">nāga</i>) to have anything to do with the rites of the brahmins. The outstanding feature of Hinduism—the great synthesis of religious and philosophical ideas and practices, from simple animism to profound non-dualism—had not yet been undertaken. Different strands of religious life were quite distinct and were not considered to be part of the same path.</p>
<p>Thus historians do not refer to the brahmanical religion of the time as Hinduism, but rather as Vedism or Brahmanism. It was nearly a thousand years later that the movement recognizable as modern Hinduism became prominent in India. To be sure, much of Hinduism is drawn from the Vedas, in the same way that much of Catholicism is drawn from the Hebrew scriptures that Christians call the Old Testament. But were you to meet Abraham or Noah and address them as “Catholics”, they would not know what you are talking about. And the Indians of the Buddha’s time would have been equally unfamiliar with the very idea of “Hinduism”.</p>
<p>All this notwithstanding, there is an oft-repeated claim to the effect that the Buddha “was born, lived, and died a Hindu”, attributed to the great pioneer of Indology, Thomas Rhys Davids. While it is true that he did write this, it was in an early work, page 116 of <cite class="book">Buddhism: its history and literature</cite>, a lecture series published in 1896. But by 1912 his views had changed, for on page 83 of <cite class="book">Buddhism: Being a sketch of the life and teachings of Gautama, the Buddha</cite>, he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gautama was born, and brought up, and lived, and died a typical Indian. Hinduism had not yet, in his time, arisen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rhys Davids emphasizes that the Buddha did not have an antagonistic relation to the Brahmanical religion. His purpose was not religious reform, but freedom from suffering. However, on page 85 of the same work he comments:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the long run the two systems were quite incompatible. … Gautama’s whole training lay indeed outside of the ritualistic lore of the Brahmanas and the brahmins. The local deities of his clan were not Vedic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lesson here is that we must avoid reading modern conditions back into ancient times. The peoples of ancient India had their own rich, complex, and many-faceted spiritual lives. We can only begin to understand them, and to understand how the Buddha related to them, when we set aside our modern preconceptions and preoccupations and listen to what they had to say for themselves.</p>
<p>An outstanding feature of early Buddhist texts is interreligious dialogue. The Buddha did not live in a Buddhist culture. We frequently encounter the Buddha and his disciples discussing various aspects of spiritual philosophy and practice with followers of other spiritual paths, or with people of no particular path. Sometimes they would come to the Buddha seeking to learn or even to attack. And it is not uncommon to find the Buddha and his disciples actively seeking out followers of other spiritual paths simply to engage in conversation. In this, the early texts are quite different from later Buddhist literature, which almost always consists of Buddhists speaking with other Buddhists.</p>
<p>While many of these people ended up declaring themselves followers of the Buddha, this was not the purpose of the dialogue. The Buddha did not debate simply to win an argument, but out of compassion, to help alleviate suffering.</p>
<p>Amid the complex sets of religious practices, we may discern three major domains.</p>
<h3>Animism</h3>
<p>In the villages and towns of ancient India, the most widespread folk religion was a belief in the omnipresent reality of spirits in nature. Such deities might embody aspects of the weather, or live in plants or rivers or caves; they might promote abundance, or take ferocious and threatening forms. They were unreliable, but could be wooed through simple offerings of rice, flowers, or ghee.</p>
<p>Animist beliefs were derived from local legends and rituals, not from religious philosophy. However, the higher religious paths such as Buddhism or Jainism, rather than repressing such beliefs, were happy to assign them a minor role in the scheme of things, so long as they eliminated harmful practices like human or animal sacrifice.</p>
<p>Throughout the Buddhist texts, we hear of <i lang="pli" translate="no">yakkhas</i> (spirits), <i lang="pli" translate="no">nāgas</i> (dragons), <i lang="pli" translate="no">gandhabbas</i> (fairies), <i lang="pli" translate="no">garudas</i> (phoenixes), and many more. The Buddhist attitude towards such beings might best be described as “good neighborliness”. Neither they, nor any higher beings, are worshiped or looked to for salvation. Rather, they are treated with respect and dignity, for who knows? If they are real, it would be good to have them on your side.</p>
<h3>Brahmanism</h3>
<p>The caste who called themselves “brahmins” inherited an ancient body of sacred lore known as the Vedas. This consisted of sets of oral scriptures, among which the Ṛg Veda was primary. In the early Buddhist texts there are three Vedas: Ṛg, Sāma, and Yajur; the Atharva is mentioned, but was not yet considered to be a Veda.</p>
<p>The Ṛg Veda grew out of the cultural and religious milieu of the ancient Indo-European peoples. It shares a common heritage with the Avestan texts of Iranian Zoroastrianism, and more distantly, the mythologies of Europe.</p>
<p>It seems that Indo-European peoples moved into India around a millennium before the Buddha, with distinct clans maintaining sets of sacred lore. In the early centuries of the first millennium BCE, in the area known as the Kuru country (modern Delhi), the clans were unified into the classical brahmanical kingdom whose story is echoed in the Mahābharata. The Ṛg Veda was forged from the books of the clans, wrapped in opening and closing chapters emphasizing unity. By the time of the Buddha, the brahmanical culture and language had already become strongly established in the regions further south and east where the Buddha lived.</p>
<p>The brahmins insisted on the holiness of their caste, the efficacy of their rituals, the truth of their scriptures, and the omnipotence of their deity. The Buddha rejected all these claims out of hand.</p>
<p>However, Brahmanical traditions were far from a unified monolith. We see a strong strand of questioning of tradition, of seeking out new ways, of earnest seeking of the truth; and such attitudes are just as strong in the Brahmanical texts as the Buddhist.</p>
<p>Brahmins were typically family men, living a settled life, and expecting a degree of social respect and standing due to their learning and caste. But some brahmins had adopted an ascetic lifestyle, apparently influenced by the <i lang="pli" translate="no">samaṇas</i>.</p>
<p>In the generations preceding the Buddha, brahmanical philosophy had reached a peak in the Upaniṣads, with their sophisticated debates and mystic philosophy of the essential unity of self and cosmos. These texts form the immediate dialectical context of the Buddha’s philosophy. Yājñavalkya, a key Upaniṣadic philosopher, lived around Mithila, in the same region traversed by the Buddha, no more than a century or two before him. Some early Upaniṣads are apparently referred to in <a class="ref" href="/dn13">DN 13</a> <cite class="text-translated">The Three Knowledges</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Tevijjasutta</cite>), and the Upaniṣadic doctrine of “self” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">ātman</i>) was prominently rejected by the Buddha in his most distinctive teaching: not-self (<i lang="pli" translate="no">anattā</i>).</p>
<h3>The Samaṇas</h3>
<p>Quite distinct from the brahmins, and often in opposition to them, was a complex set of religious movements known as the <i lang="pli" translate="no">samaṇas</i> or “ascetics”. Six prominent ascetic schools were acknowledged in the time of the Buddha. The Buddha counted himself as an ascetic, too, in view of the many similarities between his own movement and theirs.</p>
<p>Like the Buddhist mendicants, the other <i lang="pli" translate="no">samaṇas</i> were typically celibate renunciates, living either in solitude or in monastic communities, and relying on alms for food. The most famous movement—and the only one to survive until today—was Jainism, which flourished under their leader Mahāvīra, known as Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta in the Buddhist texts.</p>
<p>The ascetics shared an iconoclastic attitude, and all rejected the brahmanical system <i lang="pli" translate="no">in toto</i>. However they varied amongst each other, as shown in their teachings attested at <a class="ref" href="/dn2">DN 2</a> <cite class="text-translated">The Fruits of the Ascetic Life</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Sāmaññaphalasutta</cite>) as well as <a class="ref" href="/mn60">MN 60</a> and <a class="ref" href="/mn76">MN 76</a>. Some emphasized austerities and self-mortification, others rationality and debate. Some advocated ardent effort, others a resigned fatalism. Some taught rebirth, while others asserted that this material world was the only reality.</p>
<p>While their doctrines may appear florid and obscure, and their practices sometimes bizarre and pointless, the ascetic movements are a lasting testament to the diversity, vigor, and innovation of religious life in ancient India.</p>
<h2 id="general-item10">Cosmology</h2>
<p>A recurring theme in many of the religious strands of India is a concern for cosmology. A religious philosophy was expected to paint a picture of the world on a large scale and indicate humanity’s role within it. Like all aspects of religious life, such cosmologies were partly shared across traditions and in part were unique to each tradition.</p>
<p>Some traditions asserted a materialist cosmology, rejecting the notion that one would be reborn in any other state, and asserting that only this life was real.</p>
<p>Most cosmologies, however, posited multiple realms of existence. Beings would come and go from these different stations. Some were pleasant and desirable, while others were not. As to why this was so, different reasons were given.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some ascetics argued that beings transmigrated due to destiny or chance.</li>
<li>Mainstream Brahmanical traditions said it was due to the performance of rituals and sacrifices to the gods.</li>
<li>Some said that rebirth was determined by intentional actions, whether moral or immoral.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter view was held by some ascetic schools, such as Buddhism and Jainism, and some of the more advanced and innovative threads of Brahmanism. These traditions shared a conception of transmigration that in many ways is quite similar. Three common elements can be discerned:</p>
<ol>
<li>All sentient beings are reborn countless times in process called <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁsāra</i> (“transmigration”).</li>
<li>This process is driven by ethical choices (<i lang="pli" translate="no">kamma</i>). Good deeds lead to a pleasant rebirth; bad deeds lead to a painful rebirth.</li>
<li>True salvation is not found in any realm of existence, but only in liberation from transmigration itself.</li>
</ol>
<p>While these aspects of the cosmology were shared, the details differed in both theory and practice.</p>
<p>Jain and Brahmanical theory proposed that transmigration was undergone by a soul or self which could attain freedom. For the Jains, the individual soul (<i lang="pli" translate="no">jīva</i>) attains eternal purity and bliss. For the most sophisticated among the brahmins, the individual self (<i lang="pli" translate="no">ātman</i>) realizes its true nature as identical with the divinity that is the cosmos itself (Sanskrit: <i lang="pli" translate="no">tat tvam asi</i>; Pali: <i lang="pli" translate="no">eso hasmasmi</i>; <i lang="pli" translate="no">so attā so loko</i>).</p>
<p>The Buddha rejected all such metaphysical notions of self or soul. Instead, he explained transmigration as an ongoing process of changing conditions, formulated as the famous twelve links of dependent origination (<i lang="pli" translate="no">paṭicca samuppāda</i>).</p>
<p>In the practical application of their theory, Jains believed that the way to salvation was to firstly avoid harming any sentient beings, even unintentionally, and then to burn off past <i lang="pli" translate="no">kamma</i> through painful self-mortification. Such practices are described frequently and in detail, attesting to their prominence in early Indian spiritual life.</p>
<p>The brahmins, as seen in the suttas, did not have such a clear and unambiguous path to a highest goal, and indeed are depicted as arguing among themselves as to the correct path. This reflects the historical situation, where the earlier, simpler, and more worldly goals of Vedic Brahmanism were growing into a more sophisticated Upaniṣadic form.</p>
<p>For the Upaniṣads, the key to salvation was understanding. It is only one who understands the rituals and philosophies correctly (<i lang="pli" translate="no">ya evam veda</i>) who will experience their full benefit. In the centuries prior to the Buddha, this path of wisdom had developed into a profound contemplative culture, expressed in the ecstatic and mystical passages of the Upaniṣads.</p>
<p>The Buddha shared the Jain concern for avoiding harm, but rejected the practice of extreme austerities. Rather than bodily torment, he emphasized mental development.</p>
<p>Certain Brahmanical lineages had developed meditation to a high degree, but meditative states were still conceived in metaphysical terms. The Buddha adopted such meditations for their value in purifying the mind, but interpreted them in purely psychological terms, rejecting metaphysics entirely.</p>
<p>One of the benefits of advanced meditation was that a practitioner would develop the ability to perceive many past lives and many realms into which beings may be reborn. In this, we may distinguish between the core doctrinal texts, which typically speak of rebirth in general terms as good or bad destinies, and the narrative portions, which depicted the realms of rebirth in terms familiar from popular Indian cosmology.</p>
<p>The early texts do not attempt to systematize these realms in any great detail. Indeed, the various deities and realms mentioned defy any simple categorization. Later Buddhism developed a theory of various realms, sometimes called the 31 planes of existence, but this does not fully represent the situation as found in the early texts.</p>
<p>Here is a general overview of the most important realms found in the suttas. It is crucial to remember that, in the Buddhist view, all of these, even the most high, are impermanent and do not constitute true freedom. They are not separate metaphysical planes, but mere stations in which consciousness may spend some time during its long journey.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Brahmā realms</dt>
<dd>The highest heavens, which correspond to attainments of absorption meditation (<i lang="pli" translate="no">jhāna</i>), and may only be attained by <i lang="pli" translate="no">jhāna</i> practitioners. The Brahmā realms include the realms of luminous form (<i lang="pli" translate="no">rūpaloka</i>) and the formless realms (<i lang="pli" translate="no">arūpaloka</i>). The former are attained by means of the four primary absorptions. In this context, the word “form” refers to the refined and radiant echo or reflection of the original meditation subject upon which these states are based. The formless states lie beyond this, and are realized when even that subtle luminosity disappears.</dd>
<dt>Heavens of sensual pleasures</dt>
<dd>Many of these are mentioned, most commonly the realm of the Thirty-Three, governed by Sakka. Various beings from Indian animist beliefs are said to inhabit the lower tiers of these realms.</dd>
<dt>Human realm</dt>
<dd>The most important realm, where Buddhas appear and the spiritual path is taught.</dd>
<dt>Lower realms</dt>
<dd>These include the animal realm, the ghost realm, and the hells. The realm of the <i lang="pli" translate="no">asuras</i>—titans or demons—is usually placed here in the later cosmologies, but the early texts seem to treat it as one of the heavens.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The Buddha taught that doing good and avoiding bad was the path to rebirth in one of the fortunate realms, which include the human realm and all higher realms. However, the course of transmigration is long and unpredictable, so no heaven realm provides a sure refuge.</p>
<p>Far from teaching rebirth as a solace for naive followers unable to face the inevitability of death, rebirth is depicted in traumatic and terrifying terms: the tears that one has shed in the endless course of transmigration are greater than all the waters in all the oceans of the world. Thus the true significance of doing good deeds is not merely to get a better rebirth, but to lay the foundations for higher spiritual development, primarily through meditation.</p>
<p>In the core teaching of the four noble truths, the origin of all suffering is traced to the craving that is connected with rebirth (<i lang="pli" translate="no">yāyaṁ taṇhā ponobbhavikā</i>). The practice of the noble eightfold path is the only thing that enables one to let go of that craving and be free of suffering. This is what the Buddha called “extinguishment” or “quenching” (Pali: <i lang="pli" translate="no">nibbāna</i>; Sanskrit <i lang="pli" translate="no">nirvāṇa</i>).</p>
<h2 id="general-item11">On the Pali Commentaries</h2>
<p>The Pali canonical texts are accompanied by an extensive and detailed set of commentaries (<i lang="pli" translate="no">aṭṭhakathā</i>) and subcommentaries (<i lang="pli" translate="no">ṭīkā</i>). These texts are, for most people, even more mysterious than the canon itself, so let me say a few words on them.</p>
<p>The main commentaries were compiled by the monk Buddhaghosa at the Mahāvihāra monastery in Anuradhapura, then the capital of Sri Lanka, in the 5th century. Buddhaghosa inherited a series of older commentaries in the old Sinhalese language, now lost. These had been compiled over the centuries in Sri Lanka, mostly between around 200 BCE–200 CE; that is to say, the main content of the commentaries was closed several centuries before Buddhaghosa.</p>
<p>It was all a bit messy, with text in Pali and commentaries in Sinhala, and a variety of different commentarial texts. Buddhaghosa aimed to streamline the situation by combining all the old commentaries into a single system, translated into Pali.</p>
<p>Buddhaghosa’s work remains as an extraordinary accomplishment of traditional scholarship. He had an almost preternatural mastery of his materials, and the clarity and rigor of his writings make light work of what must have been an exceedingly difficult task. It is crucial to remember that he saw his work as that of an editor, compiler, and translator. That is what he claimed to be doing, and from everything we know about his work, he was a scholar of integrity who did exactly what he said. When he felt a need to express his own opinion he said so; but such interventions were rare and hesitant. The commentaries are the record of discussions and explanations of the Pali texts handed down in the Mahāvihāra tradition, not the opinions of Buddhaghosa.</p>
<p>While Buddhaghosa compiled commentaries on the major texts, he left some incomplete. It is not always certain which commentaries were by him; but in any case later scholars completed his work. Subsequently, subcommentaries were written to clarify obscure points in the commentaries.</p>
<p>In modern Theravāda, the commentaries have become a sadly and unnecessarily divisive issue. Some people take the entire tradition uncritically and regard the commentaries as essentially infallible. Others flip to an extreme of suspecting anything in the commentaries, rewriting Theravādin history as a conspiracy of the commentaries. But any serious scholar knows that the commentaries are often helpful, even indispensable, on countless difficult and obscure points. Without them, there is no way we would have been able to create the accurate dictionaries and translations that we have today. Yet they cannot be relied on blindly, for, like any resource, they are fallible, and must be read with a careful and critical eye. On some doctrinal issues, the position of the commentaries had shifted considerably from the stance in the suttas, and not in illuminating ways.</p>
<p>I once read some advice from a Burmese Sayadaw—I am afraid this was many years ago and I have forgotten who it was—on how to use the commentaries. He said—and I paraphrase—something like this. First read the sutta. Try to understand it. Read it and meditate on it again and again. If there’s anything you don’t understand, see if it can be explained elsewhere in the suttas. If, at the end of the day, you still cannot understand it, check the commentary. If it answers the question, good. But if, after equally careful study, the commentary is still unclear, then check the subcommentary.</p>
<p>This has always seemed like sound advice to me, and I have tried to follow it. The purpose of the commentary is to help explain the suttas. Where the suttas are clear—and mostly they are—there is no need to refer to the commentary. The only extra thing I would add is that, in addition to the commentaries and subcommentaries, we now also have Chinese and Sanskrit parallels to help us understand difficult passages.</p>
<p>In these guides, I almost completely leave aside the commentarial explanations. In several places the explanations I have given differ from those in the commentaries. I am aware of this, and have written on most of these things elsewhere, but I do not want to burden the guides by re-litigating every controversy. I don’t contradict the commentaries out of ignorance or stubbornness, but because after many years of study, contemplation, discussion, and practice, I have come to see some things differently.</p>
<h2 id="general-item12">A Brief and Incomplete Textual History</h2>
<p>The significance of the <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i> was recognized by European scholars early on. I will discuss specifics of the editions and translations in the essays on the individual <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i>, and here offer some general remarks.</p>
<p>During the 19th century, European scholars became aware of the Pali tradition, seeing in it a reliable source of information for the Buddha, his times and his teachings. An English civil servant in Sri Lanka, Thomas Rhys Davids, learned Pali from the monks, initially to help him better understand Sri Lankan legal practices. Recognizing the significance of these texts, he returned to England and established the Pali Text Society (PTS), largely funded by Asian donors. They obtained palm-leaf manuscripts, on the basis of which the PTS prepared print editions of the main Pali texts.</p>
<p>The PTS editions introduced a number of ideas from European scholarship. Most obviously, they used a set of conventions for presenting Indic scripts with European letters. This system is lossless, so texts may be automatically changed from one script to another. It enables easy comparison between the editions of the Pali canon from different countries, which traditionally had been written in diverse local scripts. They also introduced titles at the start of texts, punctuation and capitalization, page numbers, footnotes, variant readings, and various other modern innovations.</p>
<p>One innovation that was not pursued consistently was the use of chapter and section numbers. These were added to the PTS Pali editions of the Dīgha Nikāya and the Vinaya, and are used in subsequent translations. However most of the PTS editions lack such sections, with the unfortunate consequence that academic referencing of Pali texts is still based on the volume and page of the PTS edition, a system that is neither practical nor precise.</p>
<p>The PTS editions were ground-breaking and have exerted an unparalleled influence on modern Buddhism, both east and west. Asian scholars have been well aware of them, with the consequence that it is probably hard to find any printed edition from the 20th century that is completely free of their influence. Nevertheless, the PTS texts are not particularly reliable. They were put together over a considerable period of time, with scant resources and few workers. The editors used whatever manuscripts they had to hand, and, apart from a general preference for Sri Lankan readings, it is hard to discern a consistent or clear methodology in their choices of readings. The limitations of these editions are well known among experts in the field, and in some cases updated and improved editions have been published.</p>
<p>For my translation of the <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i>, I preferred to use the Mahāsaṅgīti edition. This is essentially a digital representation of the Burmese textual tradition of the 6th Council, itself based on the 19th century 5th Council text. It is based on the digital edition prepared by the Vipassana Research Institute, with extensive proofreading and corrections by the Dhamma Society of Bangkok. The Mahāsaṅgīti is a consistent and carefully edited digital text, and for that reason was chosen as the root Pali text for SuttaCentral. But it should not be assumed that it is the most authentic. On the contrary, it preserves the Burmese readings, which tend to correct the text in conformity with the Pali grammars. Nevertheless, in almost all such cases there is no difference in the meaning, just minor differences in spelling.</p>
<p>Like most translators, when editions vary I did not adhere to one edition, but simply selected what seems to be the best reading in each case. I referred to the PTS editions fairly often. More rarely, I consulted the romanized Buddha Jayanthi edition found on GRETIL; note, however, that the digital edition is widely regarded as being inferior to the original in Sinhalese script. Occasionally I also consulted the Rama 5 edition in Thai script. I also consulted previous translations, especially those of Bhikkhu Bodhi.</p>
<p>In problematic cases I cross-checked the Pali against the Sanskrit and Chinese parallels; I did not make use of Tibetan sources. However in every case the overriding intention was to accurately represent the Pali text. Only in a very few exceptional cases did I rely on the Sanskrit or Chinese parallels to correct the Pali.</p>

<p>The Dīgha Nikāya is the first of the four main divisions in the Sutta Piṭaka of the Pali Canon (<i lang="pli" translate="no">tipiṭaka</i>). It is translated here as <cite class="text-translated">Long Discourses</cite>. As the title suggests, its discourses are somewhat longer than those of other <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i>. There are, however, only 34 discourses in the collection, so despite the length of the individual discourses, the collection as a whole is the shortest of the <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i>.</p>
<p>It is distinguished from the other <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i> by its more developed and elaborate literary forms. Outgrowing the bare and direct style of most of the early texts, here the extra length offers space for narratives and doctrinal expositions to find a fuller expression. This is an early hint at how the literary form of Buddhist texts was to develop in later years, moving towards expansiveness and abundance.</p>
<p>It is no coincidence that these elaborate texts are often addressed to the brahmins, who were the self-proclaimed spiritual leaders of the time. The brahmins were the custodians of the most sophisticated texts in ancient India up to this time, the Vedic literature. It seems that one aim of the Dīgha was to impress such learned men. These discourses offer a wide range of examples of how the Buddha related to those of other religious paths.</p>
<p>Another overriding theme of the Dīgha is the passing away of the Buddha. The centerpiece of the collection is <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN 16</a>, <cite class="text-translated">The Great Discourse on the Buddha’s Extinguishment</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbānasutta</cite>), a discourse of unrivaled importance. This presents the last journey of the Buddha, wandering in unhurried stages from town to town, each step bringing him closer to his passing. In the very length of the text, recording so many details of the journey, we can sense a longing to draw out those last precious days as far as possible.</p>
<h2 id="intro-item1">How the Dīgha is Organized</h2>
<p>The 34 discourses are grouped in three <i lang="pli" translate="no">vaggas</i>. The first <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> consists of thirteen discourses, each of which includes a lengthy passage on the spiritual practice of a monastic, known as the Gradual Training (<i lang="pli" translate="no">anupubbasikkhā</i>).</p>
<p>In the second <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> we find a number of discourses of a more biographical nature. <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn14">DN 14</a> <cite class="text-translated">The Great Discourse on the Harvest of Deeds</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Mahāpadānasutta</cite>) tells of past Buddhas, while <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN 16</a> <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite> tells of Gotama’s last days. In addition, a number of other discourses in this section are closely related to the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite>. I will discuss this cycle further below.</p>
<p>The final <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> is more miscellaneous. It includes long poetic sections, doctrinal compilations—some of which are precursors to the Abhidhamma—and narratives that are often humorous and occasionally border on farce.</p>
<p>As usual in the <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i>, there is no overall sequence of the teaching and many details of organization appear quite arbitrary. Still, we can discern a purpose in the arrangement of a few of the major discourses. These details are unique to the Theravadin tradition, so should be seen as reflecting their concerns, rather than the fundamental principles of the Dīgha.</p>
<p>The first discourse, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn1">DN 1</a> <cite class="text-translated">The Prime Net</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Brahmajalasutta</cite>), sets out a scheme of wrong views, and thus acts as a filter for the Dhamma, screening out possible misinterpretations. It seems that this arrangement was connected with the events of the so-called “Third Council” under King Ashoka, at a time when the Saṅgha was overrun with imposters who were not genuine Buddhists. The second discourse, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn2">DN 2</a> <cite class="text-translated">The Fruits of the Ascetic Life</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Sāmaññaphalasutta</cite>), addresses a fundamental question: why do people follow a life of renunciation? In answering this, it sets forth the Gradual Training, a distinctively Buddhist path to peace.</p>
<p>The middle of the collection is dominated by discourses that deal in one way or another with the cosmic significance of the Buddha (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn14">DN 14</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN 16</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn17">DN 17</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn18">DN 18</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn19">DN 19</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn20">DN 20</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn21">DN 21</a>; to these may be added <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn26">DN 26</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn27">DN 27</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn30">DN 30</a>, and <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn32">DN 32</a>). Where the biographical texts of the Majjhima emphasize the practical and the personal, the specifics of how <em>our</em> Buddha lived, these discourses exist in an arena of mythic grandeur. Time and space are expanded as the poignant and personal details of the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite> are set among a series of mythological texts that show the potency of the Buddha and his teachings in the deep past, in the apocalyptic future, and in the present among the orders of gods.</p>
<p>The central event in all this is the death of the Buddha. Historically this was a traumatic crisis for the Buddhist community, and many feared that the Dhamma would not survive. By lifting attention from the present trauma and pointing to a longer meaning, these suttas show that the Dhamma need not die with the Buddha. The events of the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite> spurred the Saṅgha to hold the First Council, where the discourses were collected and organized to ensure their preservation. And these are, of course, the very scriptures that we are reading. In this way, these narratives tell the story of their own origin.</p>
<p>The Dīgha finishes with mostly doctrinal compilations (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn28">DN 28</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn29">DN 29</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn33">DN 33</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn34">DN 34</a>). If the beginning of the Dīgha tells us <em>why</em> the teachings matter and the middle tells us <em>how</em> they came to be, the ending tells us <em>what</em> they are. It is a rather curious thing that in the Dīgha, many of the doctrines that we think of as fundamental to the Buddha’s teachings occur only rarely. These discourses rectify this situation, ensuring that the students of the Dīgha had access to a wide range of teachings. The last two discourses, in particular, are clearly compiled as handy mnemonics for memorizing sets of doctrinal teachings.</p>
<h2 id="intro-item2">The Gradual Training</h2>
<p>The Gradual Training sets out the steps taken by a Buddhist renunciate on their path. It begins with the arising of a Buddha in the world. Hearing the Buddha’s teaching, a person reflects on how best it can be applied to their own life. Realizing that “the household life is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open”, they give up their worldly possessions and attachments, don the ochre robe of a Buddhist mendicant, and undertake a life of morality, simplicity, and meditation. Proceeding step by step to ever more advanced practices, they eventually enter into deep meditative absorption (<i lang="pli" translate="no">jhāna</i>) before realizing the four noble truths and finding true freedom.</p>
<p>The Gradual Training is an expansion of the threefold training (<i lang="pli" translate="no">tisso sikkhā</i>): ethics (<i lang="pli" translate="no">sīla</i>), meditative immersion (<i lang="pli" translate="no">samādhi</i>), and wisdom (<i lang="pli" translate="no">paññā</i>). At <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.89">AN 3.89</a> the three trainings are defined:</p>
<ul>
<li>ethics (in a monastic context) requires keeping the monastic rules;</li>
<li>meditative immersion is the four absorptions;</li>
<li>wisdom is the understanding of the four noble truths.</li>
</ul>
<p>This teaching is distributed widely throughout the early Buddhist texts. In the Dīgha, for example, it’s found in the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite> as a standard teaching repeated by the Buddha at many of the stops on his journey. A series of shorter discourses on this subject may be found in the Samaṇa Vagga of the Aṅguttara (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3-samanavagga">AN 3.81–91</a>).</p>
<p>This brief overview of the path is explained more fully in the Gradual Training, which explains each of the three trainings in considerable detail. This longer exposition appears to have been the original teaching on the overall lifestyle, practices, and aims of the Buddha’s mendicant followers. It seems that the Buddha preferred to encourage his monastics by exhorting them to follow the highest ideals of conduct and meditation. Only reluctantly did he set up the legal system of the Vinaya texts, with its procedures and punishments.</p>
<p>The Gradual Training is found, in somewhat varying forms, in the Majjhima (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn27">MN 27</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn51">MN 51</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn38">MN 38</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn39">MN 39</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn53">MN 53</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn107">MN 107</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn125">MN 125</a>), the Aṅguttara (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.198">AN 4.198</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an10.99">AN 10.99</a>), and even the Abhidhamma (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/vb12">Vb 12</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/pp2.4#114">Pp 2.4:114</a>). Curiously enough, however, it is not found among the collected discourses on the path found in the last book of the Saṁyutta. While virtually all of the practices of the Gradual Training are found in the Saṁyutta, the overall framework is not found.</p>
<p>The Dīgha makes up for this lack by placing a <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> of thirteen discourses right at the start featuring the Gradual Training. This is called the Sīlakkhandhavagga, the “Chapter on the Aggregate of Ethics”. Despite the title, however, these texts treat the full training on ethics, meditative immersion, and wisdom.</p>
<p>While the content is similar in each place that the Gradual Training appears, the Dīgha versions feature a pronounced emphasis on beauty and pleasure. The stages of the path are illustrated by similes that are as lovely as they are apt, while each step of the path is said to be accompanied by a deepening sense of pleasure and happiness. The Gradual Training is not a path of suffering, but one of grace and joy and freedom.</p>
<p>Due to the repetition, the texts invariably abbreviate all the expositions except for the first two discourses. It should be remembered, however, that this is merely a consequence of how the Pali tradition arranged these texts. In the Sanskrit and Chinese Dīrghāgamas, the texts in this section are arranged differently, and different suttas are either expanded or abbreviated accordingly.</p>
<p>While the focus is firmly on monastic life, the general principles hold good for everyone, and indeed at <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn53">MN 53</a> <cite class="text-translated">A Trainee</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Sekhasutta</cite>), Ānanda teaches essentially the same path to a lay audience. In the Sīlakkhandhavagga, many discourses are in fact addressed to lay people, most of whom are brahmins.</p>
<p>The question of King Ajātasattu in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn2">DN 2</a> provides the key to understanding why this is so. He points out that in worldly life, each trade can be seen to have its own benefit. But what is the benefit of the renunciate life? While other ascetics falter before this question, the Buddha presents the Gradual Training. He shows how the life gone forth is not one of pain and distress, nor one of delayed gratification, but one that shows real benefits in this life. It is about the power and transformative potential of inner development and meditation. In contrast, the household path offers only limited happiness, with much uncertainty and stress, while the paths of other ascetics are unclear, ineffective, or painful, and the brahmins can only offer rituals and prayers of dubious efficacy. Thus the Gradual Training explains why there is a need for the Saṅgha at all.</p>
<p>Just as the Gradual Training is built from the kernel of the threefold training, the code of monastic ethics is built from the core principles of basic precepts. It is divided into three sections. The first section begins with the most fundamental precept for everyone in Buddhism: non-violence, to refrain from killing any creature, however small. It continues with items found in such common teachings as the five precepts and the ten paths of skillful action. But it adds items that specially pertain to monastic life, such as avoiding luxuries and ownership of property. The second section on ethics expands these specifically monastic and renunciate precepts in much greater detail, while the final section deals with right livelihood. A Buddhist monastic, who relies on alms food given in faith, should not make a living by other means, especially through superstitious and magical practices.</p>
<p>The Gradual Training builds on these ethical foundations as the mendicant undertakes a series of practices designed to quell the busyness and activity of the mind. They rein in their senses, avoiding things that are overly stimulating. They focus on remaining mindful and aware throughout all their activities. They aim at contentment, being satisfied with a few simple possessions.</p>
<p>Only when all these have been developed does the mendicant resort to seclusion for meditation. Going to the forest, they undertake mindfulness meditation and give up the five hindrances that prevent peace of mind. These hindrances are one of the core meditation teachings in the suttas, regarded as the key obstacle to absorption. They are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Sensual desire</dt>
<dd>Includes any kind of craving, greed, or desire for sensual experience. It includes powerful forms such as sexual desire as well as more subtle kinds of attachment.</dd>
<dt>Ill will</dt>
<dd>Anything from outright hatred to subtle forms of annoyance and aversion come under this hindrance.</dd>
<dt>Dullness and drowsiness</dt>
<dd>When the mind begins to settle down in meditation, it commonly becomes sleepy or dull.</dd>
<dt>Restlessness and remorse</dt>
<dd>Restlessness is always looking for some future experience, while remorse keeps digging up the past, especially moments of regret.</dd>
<dt>Doubt</dt>
<dd>It is normal and healthy to doubt when it comes to things that we do not know. But if we do not understand the elements of what is right and what is wrong, doubt will subtly undermine our meditation.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Experiencing an ever-deepening peace and bliss, they ultimately enter a series of profoundly still states of meditative immersion known as the four absorptions (<i lang="pli" translate="no">jhānas</i>).</p>
<p>The absorptions are the fundamental meditation practice in early Buddhism and are essential to all stages of Awakening. They occur in many contexts, but it is here, in the Gradual Training, that they emerge most naturally from the life and practice undertaken by the mendicants. This context was so central to early Buddhists that when they compiled the early Abhidhamma text, the Vibhaṅga, the chapter on Absorption begins with the Gradual Training. It is true, there are lay followers in the early texts who were said to have practiced absorption. But it is equally true that when the Buddha taught how to attain such profound peace, he emphasized the power of deep renunciation.</p>
<p>It has become common in certain modern forms of Buddhism to assert that absorptions are not an essential part of the path. Others say that, while important, the absorptions are relatively shallow states of concentration that may be easily attained on a short retreat. Suffice to say, neither of these views finds support in the early texts. The absorptions are essential, profound, and difficult to attain. Even with the full strength of renunciation, many mendicants in the Buddha’s day struggled to realize them. Nevertheless, it is a special quality of the Dhamma that each step along the path is accompanied by deepening peace and joy, and letting go gets easier the further one travels. This is what makes the realization of even such profound and subtle states possible.</p>
<p>Emerging from the absorptions, the mendicant harnesses the power of a deeply purified mind to realize a series of special forms of knowledge or insight. These culminate in the realization of the four noble truths:</p>
<ol>
<li>Suffering (<i lang="pli" translate="no">dukkha</i>).</li>
<li>The origin of suffering, i.e. craving (<i lang="pli" translate="no">samudaya</i>).</li>
<li>The cessation of suffering, i.e. Nibbāna (<i lang="pli" translate="no">nirodha</i>).</li>
<li>The practice that leads to the end of suffering (<i lang="pli" translate="no">magga</i>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Suffering is the spur that drives us to undertake spiritual practice. Only when we have some experience of suffering will we look for an escape. And when encountering the Buddha’s teaching, a seeker recognizes that the Dhamma speaks to that which matters in their own life, offering a powerful and pragmatic solution. But wallowing in suffering gets you nowhere. When you understand that this suffering is real, but has causes and conditions that you can do something about, it sparks faith and the resolve to act. The path itself is one of unfolding happiness and receding pain; the truth of the ending of suffering is experienced at every step. This culminates in the experience of profound meditative stillness, called absorption (<i lang="pli" translate="no">jhāna</i>) or immersion (<i lang="pli" translate="no">samādhi</i>). In such states, having let go of sensual desire, the five external senses cease (<i lang="pli" translate="no">vivicc’eva kāmehi</i>) and the mind feels a peace and happiness unlike anything it has known before. Empowered by the clarity and brilliance of absorption, the reality of suffering and its cause becomes apparent. This signifies that one has realized the first stage of awakening, that of the stream-enterer (<i lang="pli" translate="no">sotāpanna</i>).</p>
<p>Stream-entry occurs when all the factors of the path—from the arousing of faith to the practice of absorption and deep insight—have been developed to a sufficient degree. At this point one has a profound insight into the nature of reality, letting go three of the ten fetters that bind a person to rebirth. In the Gradual Training the understanding of the four noble truths is usually followed by the understanding of the end of the defilements (<i lang="pli" translate="no">āsava</i>), which signifies the attainment of full perfection (<i lang="pli" translate="no">arahattā</i>). The remaining fetters are given up at this point, which is the final stage of the path: full awakening and freedom.</p>
<h2 id="intro-item3">How to Build a Long Discourse</h2>
<p>There are over a thousand discourses recorded in each of the Aṅguttara and the Saṁyutta Nikāyas, but only 34 long texts recorded in the Dīgha. The relatively short texts of the Aṅguttara and Saṁyutta are reminiscent of the pre-Buddhist Upaniṣads, especially the Bṛhadāraṇyaka and Chandogya. These consist of a series of mostly independent passages, each episode covering no more than a few pages, and assembled into a much larger text. They are recollections of concise and focused teachings at certain times and places by certain people. It would seem, then, from the overwhelming majority of contemporary texts both Buddhist and Brahmanical, that the short discourse or dialogue was the standard format.</p>
<p>How, then, were these long texts constructed? Why? And for whom? Let us approach these questions by briefly considering a few different forms employed in the Dīgha.</p>
<h3>Inherently Complex Subjects</h3>
<p>Some discourses are long because the subject matter is inherently complex and demands a lengthy explanation. Of course, the Buddha was a master of presenting subjects in both pithy and detailed forms. Nevertheless, there are a few discourses whose subject matter requires an extensive treatment.</p>
<p>The most prominent example of this is the Gradual Training. In some cases—for example <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn6">DN 6</a> <cite class="text-translated">With Mahāli</cite> and <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn7">DN 7</a> <cite class="text-translated">With Jāliya</cite>—the discourse consists of little more than this passage, with a simple narrative background and some short extra teachings. So it seems that the presence of the long Gradual Training section was itself enough to qualify a discourse as “long”. Since this passage aims to provide a detailed guide to the whole of the renunciate spiritual life, from hearing the teaching to full awakening, the length is inherent in the subject matter. True, it is taught more briefly elsewhere, but even in those cases it tends to be somewhat long, and there was clearly a tendency to make it more inclusive.</p>
<p>In other cases the Gradual Training is taught in the middle of a discourse that is already quite extensive. Such is the case with <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn1">DN 1</a> <cite class="text-root">Brahmajala</cite>, although here, uniquely, it is only the first section on Ethics that is taught. But the bulk of the text sets forth a network of 62 kinds of wrong view. Here, the nature of the subject matter is so extensive and complex that a shorter exposition would not do it justice. Indeed, when this teaching is mentioned in shorter discourses (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn41.3">SN 41.3</a>), it is not summarized, but the reader is referred rather to the full text.</p>
<h3>Compilations</h3>
<p>Far more common than inherently lengthy teachings are the compilations. In such cases, a long text provides an occasion or background framework within which a series of short passages are collected. Such passages usually occur in identical or near-identical form in the Aṅguttara or the Saṁyutta, and occasionally the Majjhima. Compiling them here enables the reciters of the Dīgha to learn a wide range of doctrines, and provides an essential backup, preserving the texts in case the shorter discourses are lost.</p>
<p>In a few instances, such short passages are not found elsewhere in exactly the same form. Whether that is because they were unique to the Dīgha, or because the parallel passages have become lost, is hard to say.</p>
<p>How do we end up with parallel passages in so many different places?</p>
<p>Clearly the Buddha taught very often and, like all teachers, repeated his message many times. Such repeated teachings would have been collected in various places. This would be the case with important and generic teachings found throughout the Buddhist literature, like the four noble truths or the four absorptions.</p>
<p>In some cases, though, this is unlikely or impossible. For example, we sometimes find the exact same event on the same occasion—with the same teaching, the same location, and the same people—occurring in more than one text. In such instances it is clear that there is, in fact, just one passage, and it has been copied into two or more places.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, it is prudent to assume that such passages existed as short discourses before being collected into the larger forms. This is because, as noted above, the short discourse is the dominant form, and rests closest to the oral tradition. It is a principle observed everywhere through early Buddhist texts that the redactors preferred to add rather than subtract. Thus texts commonly become longer over time, and rarely shorter.</p>
<p>Examples of compilation are very common, and almost every discourse in the Dīgha does this to some extent. Here are just a few examples.</p>
<p><a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN 16</a> <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite> includes a wide range of collected passages. In some cases events pertinent to the narrative may have occurred there originally and been extracted later, while in other cases the included passages seem strangely extraneous to the context and were no doubt added in at some point.</p>
<p>Venerable Sāriputta is said to be the main author of several such long compilations. He is the teacher in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn33">DN 33</a> <cite class="text-translated">Reciting in Concert</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Saṅgītisutta</cite>) and <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn34">DN 34</a> <cite class="text-translated">Up to Ten</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Dasuttarasutta</cite>), which consist almost entirely of short passages collected from elsewhere in the suttas and arranged by number. In <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn28">DN 28</a> <cite class="text-translated">Inspiring Confidence</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Sampasādanīyasutta</cite>) he expresses his great faith in the Buddha, and cites a long series of passages to display the Buddha’s glory.</p>
<p>A more sophisticated form of compilation is found in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn22">DN 22</a> <cite class="text-translated">The Longer Discourse on Mindfulness Meditation</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Mahāsatipaṭṭhānasutta</cite>), the most important meditation discourse in 20th century Theravāda. It gives a detailed account of the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. These are taught in brief in many places, but the details are found only here and at the mostly identical <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn10">MN 10</a> <cite class="text-translated">Mindfulness Meditation</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Satipaṭṭhānasutta</cite>). Whereas many compilations simply list a series of different teachings, here the text is very systematic, organizing the compiled passages under the four heads. These meditation passages are mostly not found elsewhere in the Dīgha, and were no doubt added to ensure the Dīgha reciters preserved the full range of meditation teachings.</p>
<p>To the already lengthy discourse at <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn10">MN 10</a> is added a full exposition on the four noble truths, sourced from <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn141">MN 141</a> <cite class="text-translated">The Analysis of the Truths</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Saccavibhaṅgasutta</cite>). In Burmese editions, this extended section later made its way back into the text of <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn10">MN 10</a>. Since SuttaCentral’s text is a Burmese one, we include this in our Pali, but mark it as an addition.</p>
<h3>Narratives: backgrounds, parables, and myths</h3>
<p>Unusually for early Buddhist texts, the Dīgha includes several lengthy narratives. Most obviously this includes <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN 16</a> <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite>. But it also includes a number of other narratives.</p>
<p>In common with the discourses of other collections, we often find a simple narrative background that gives context to the teaching. However, in some cases this is developed in much greater detail as the narratives come to play a more sophisticated literary role than mere setting.</p>
<p><a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn2">DN 2</a> <cite class="text-root">Sāmaññaphala</cite> opens with King Ajātasattu of Magadha exclaiming over the beauty of the moonlit night and asking his ministers for advice as to which ascetic teacher he should visit. From the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite> and discourses elsewhere we know that Ajātasattu was a warlike king, so this setting immediately establishes a sense of wonder. The narrative unfolds gracefully, avoiding the excess of ornament so typical of later Indian narratives, and holding the key to its mystery close to its chest. Only at the end of the text do we learn the dreadful secret that plagues the king’s heart. Thus the narrative portions imbue the teachings—on the doctrines of other teachers as contrasted with the Buddha’s Gradual Training—with a tragic pathos.</p>
<p>In addition to backgrounds, we also find narratives that are told as stories in the discourses themselves. These include short parables like the tale of the monk who mistakenly sought among the gods for an answer to his question (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn11">DN 11</a>). In <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn23">DN 23</a> the monk Kumāra Kassapa debates with the skeptic Pāyāsi, illustrating his arguments with a series of tales alternatively humorous and gruesome. Such parables are found not infrequently elsewhere in the suttas, but in the Dīgha certain stories expand beyond this and approach the stature of myth. This includes some of the texts in the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite> cycle, such as <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn17">DN 17</a> <cite class="text-root">Mahāsudassanasutta</cite> and <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn14">DN 14</a> <cite class="text-root">Mahāpadānasutta</cite>.</p>
<p>To forestall a common misunderstanding, in the study of religion, “myth” does not mean “something believed to be true that is actually false”, as it does in popular culture. Rather, a myth is a sacred story. Some sacred stories are true, some are inventions. But this is a matter for historians and is irrelevant to the mythology itself. The purpose of myth is to tell a story that creates meaning for those who participate in it, so they can understand their own lives in the context of the story being expressed.</p>
<p>The Dīgha contains truly mythic texts in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn26">DN 26</a> <cite class="text-translated">The Wheel-Turning Monarch</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Cakkavattisīhanādasutta</cite>) and <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn27">DN 27</a> <cite class="text-translated">The Origin of the World</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Aggaññasutta</cite>). These set forth a myth of origins, replacing conventional creation mythology with an evolutionary account of how the world came to be the way it is. In these stories, human choices play a critical role in how the environment evolves, and in how it will all fall apart. The <cite class="text-root">Aggañña</cite> depicts climate change quite explicitly, showing how human activity affects the plants, the weather, and the natural ecosystem of which we are a part (see also <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.56">AN 3.56</a>).</p>
<p>The mythology is essentially cyclic. There is no absolute beginning, just another turning of the wheel. Thus even when the world falls apart and civilization collapses, there will be a new renaissance, far in the future, and ultimately another Buddha will arise. He is named as Metteyya (Sanskrit: <i lang="pli" translate="no">Maitreya</i>), who in the early texts appears only in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn26">DN 26</a> <cite class="text-root">Cakkavattisīhanāda</cite>. He went on to become one of the most important figures in Mahāyāna Buddhism, and many Buddhists even today still await his coming with hope. Yet <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn26">DN 26</a> is not taught in order to encourage devotees to dedicate themselves to Metteyya, but to illustrate the impermanence and uncertainty of our lives. The Buddha always taught that we should practice as best we can to understand the Dhamma in this life.</p>
<h2 id="intro-item4">The Mahāparinibbāna Cycle</h2>
<p>In several instances, episodes mentioned in brief in the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite> have been spun off and expanded to become individual discourses in their own right. Thus the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite> dominates much of the Dīgha, not just through its own length and thematic weight, but through its influence and connections with other discourses.</p>
<p>In my view, this cycle of suttas was likely composed by Ānanda and his students, beginning this great literary work with the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbānasutta</cite> itself, and gradually branching off into related works. The cycle as a whole shows not only Ānanda’s characteristic personal love and devotion for the Buddha, but also reveals a concern for what is to come, for the fate of the Dhamma in the years after the Buddha’s passing. One distinctive unifying detail of these discourses is that they do not end with the standard phrase saying that the listeners rejoiced in the teachings, but instead finish directly with a teaching or a verse on the subject of impermanence or the long-lasting of the dispensation. Ānanda survived the Buddha for several decades, and his legacy was the establishment of the texts, thus preserving the memory of his beloved Teacher for future generations.</p>

<dt><a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN 16</a> <cite class="text-translated">The Great Discourse on the Buddha’s Extinguishment</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbānasutta</cite>)</dt>
<dd>Beginning with King Ajātasattu of Magadha declaring his intent to invade the Vajjis, and ending with the peaceful distribution of the Buddha’s relics to the potentially warring nations and clans, the story of the Buddha’s last journeys is as politically revealing as it is spiritually moving. Throughout, the theme of impermanence unifies the diverse events and teachings. The weight of constructing such an epic shows, however, in the considerable differences between extant versions of the text. Many of the extra repetitious sections—such as the apparently superfluous sets of eight that follow the eight causes of earthquakes—are not found in all parallels. It seems that over time, more and more material was added, and at certain points portions of the text were split off to form other discourses in the cycle.</dd>
<dt><a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn17">DN 17</a> <cite class="text-translated">King Mahāsudassana</cite></dt>
<dd>In a small scene of the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite>, Ānanda encourages the Buddha to pass away in a well-known city, not in the obscure village of Kusinārā. The Buddha rebukes him, saying that in the past it had been a great city. The Sanskrit (Sarvāstivāda) versions of the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite> include a shorter account of the story of King Mahāsudassana in their <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite> itself, but in the Pali it has become greatly extended and formed into its own long discourse. The discourse itself is fabulous, full of extended passages on the crystal balustrades and other wonders of Mahāsudassana’s palace. But at its heart is a very human story: the love of the queen for her king, and the pain of letting go. The struggle that the queen undergoes to fully understand that her king must pass mirrors the struggles of Ānanda in the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite> as he comes to terms with the passing of his beloved Teacher.</dd>
<dt><a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn18">DN 18</a> <cite class="text-translated">With Janavasabha</cite></dt>
<dd>Like <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn17">DN 17</a>, this begins with a short passage extracted from the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite>, to which has been added an extended narrative. During the journey in the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite>, Ānanda asks the Buddha to reveal the fate after death of devotees in the town of Nādika. Characteristically, it ends with the Buddha showing how people may know for themselves their own spiritual progress. This short passage is preserved as an independent discourse also in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn55.10">SN 55.10</a>. In <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn18">DN 18</a>, however, the discourse continues with a long story of the doings of the gods, as told by the spirit Janavasabha. It culminates by saying that this discourses was learned by the Buddha from Janavasabha, and from there was taught to Ānanda, and he informed the assemblies of monks, nuns, laymen, and lay women, resulting in the Buddha’s dispensation being famous and successful among gods and men. This corroborates the idea that these discourses, shaped by Ānanda, were aimed at ensuring the long-lasting of Buddhism.</dd>
<dt><a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn28">DN 28</a> <cite class="text-translated">Inspiring Confidence</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Sampasādanīyasuttasutta</cite>)</dt>
<dd>The <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite> records an incident where Sāriputta, the Buddha’s foremost disciple, comes to him and makes a “lion’s roar” of his faith in the Buddha, based on his understanding of Dhamma. This is recorded as an independent discourse at <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn47.12">SN 47.12</a>. We also have a short discourse at <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn47.13">SN 47.13</a> that tells of Sāriputta’s death. This echoes the themes of the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite>, even including the famous saying that one should be one’s own refuge. Clearly this must have happened during the journey recorded in the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite>. Oddly, however, it is not included in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN 16</a>, and in addition, it situates the Buddha in Sāvatthī, far from the track of his journey. Regardless, the passage on the lion’s roar was expanded into its own extensive discourse, with Sāriputta expounding at length on various inspiring qualities of the Buddha. This gives an opportunity to list many standard doctrinal teachings. Like <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn18">DN 18</a>, the sutta ends with an exhortation to share the teaching.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In addition to texts that have a direct literary and narrative connection with the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite>, there is a further series of discourses that share a more indirect or thematic connection.</p>
<dl>
<dt><a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn14">DN 14</a> <cite class="text-translated">The Great Discourse on the Harvest of Deeds</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Mahāpadānasuttasutta</cite>)</dt>
<dd>The Buddha gives biographical details of six past Buddhas, as well as a lengthy account of the life of one of them, Vipassī. This discourse establishes the historical Buddha Gotama as one of a series of world teachers that stretches back into the deep past, and whose dispensations all follow similar patterns.</dd>
<dt><a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn29">DN 29</a> <cite class="text-translated">An Impressive Discourse</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Pāsādikasutta</cite>)</dt>
<dd>This begins with the story of the passing away of the Jain leader Mahāvīra (Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta). In the Buddhist texts, this is depicted as a disaster for the Jains, as they fell apart in conflict right away. Whether this is historically accurate or not, the text shows the Buddha taking the opportunity to teach the qualities that make a religious movement last long after the passing of the founder. Discourses in response to this are found at <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN 16</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn29">DN 29</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn33">DN 33</a>, and <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn104">MN 104</a>. In the current sutta, contrasting his own dispensation with what he claims was the inadequacy of Jain techings, the Buddha declares that the faith and practice of his followers is well-grounded, since it is based on genuine Awakening.</dd>
<dt><a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn30">DN 30</a> <cite class="text-translated">The Marks of a Great Man</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Lakkhaṇasutta</cite>)</dt>
<dd>The early texts refer several times to a mysterious set of bodily characteristics known as the “marks of a great man”. These are said to fulfill a brahmanical prophecy that one who possesses such marks will either become a universal emperor or a fully awakened Buddha. Normally when the suttas present something as a brahmanical teaching, it is in fact found in brahmanical texts. But in this case no trace of such a doctrine has been found, so the origins of this mythological idea are obscure. The story of the two paths is a classic mythological theme, found in the oldest known myth, the story of Gilgamesh. The marks of a great man exist as a curious counterpoint to the rational teachings found in most of the suttas. In this particular sutta, the Buddha is said to have explained each mark as a consequence of a specific kind of kammic deed. The literary and verse styles betray this as a late composition, and it has no real parallel in other collections. Nevertheless, it remains as a testament to the evolution of the idea of the Buddha, relating his spiritual qualities to his physical presence.</dd>
<dt><a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn33">DN 33</a> <cite class="text-translated">Reciting in Concert</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Saṅgītisutta</cite>)</dt>
<dd>Like <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn29">DN 29</a>, this discourse is set after the death of Mahāvīra. Speaking to the Mallians of Pāvā—who appear also in the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite>—the Buddha asks Sāriputta to speak on his behalf. This echoes the theme of <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn28">DN 28</a> and <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn29">DN 29</a>, that it is the disciples who will be responsible for the continuation of the teachings. Sāriputta gives an extensive systematic presentation of doctrines, using the Aṅguttara principle of organizing teachings by number. Indeed, a study of this discourse can serve as an introduction to the teachings found in the Aṅguttara Nikāya. The monastics are encouraged to recite these teachings in concert, so that they may be preserved and the dispensation continued for a long time. This discourse anticipates the systematic tendencies of the Abhidhamma, and indeed one of the Sarvāstivādin Abhidhamma texts (<cite class="text-root">Saṅgītiparyāya</cite>) consists of an expansion and commentary on this discourse.</dd>
<dt><a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn34">DN 34</a> <cite class="text-translated">Up to Ten</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Dasuttarasutta</cite>)</dt>
<dd>This is similar to the <cite class="text-root">Saṅgīti</cite>, but with a briefer narrative context and even more systematic style. Here the Buddha no longer appears, and the discourse is simply spoken by Sāriputta.</dd>
</dl>
<p>This does not exhaust the scope of the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite> cycle, for it is not confined to the Dīgha. We have already mentioned that several shorter suttas contain episodes either found in the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite> or related to it. And the story does not end with the Buddha’s death. The <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite> tells of the funeral arrangements and events following the Buddha’s passing. In several versions apart from the Pali, this story continues directly into the account of the First Council. This narrative is the 21st chapter of the Vinaya Khandhakas, and indeed the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite> is found in the Vinaya of several schools. It is, in fact, one continuous narrative, and one of the many purposes of the <cite class="text-root">Mahāparinibbāna</cite> is to authorize the actions of the Saṅgha at the First Council, establishing the fundamental Buddhist scriptures in an organized and definitive manner. The First Council narrative was then extended to the Second Council, which echoes many of the same themes and ideas.</p>
<p>These stories of the end of the Buddha’s life and teaching are also echoed in the first chapter of the Vinaya Khandhakas, which tells the story of the Buddha’s awakening, first teaching, and establishing of his community of followers. These are not just separate episodes in the Buddha’s life. The texts as we have them frequently echo ideas, turns of phrase, events, and people, all of which show that they were edited and composed as a coherent whole. Taken together, they make up a framework of a magnificent mythology: the life and death of the greatest spiritual teacher that the world has ever known.</p>
<h2 id="intro-item5">A Brief Textual History</h2>
<p>The Dīgha Nikāya was edited by T.W. Rhys Davids and J.E. Carpenter on the basis of manuscripts in Sinhalese, Burmese, and Thai scripts, and published in three volumes in Latin script by the Pali Text Society from 1890 to 1910.</p>
<p>The first translation followed in 1899–1921 by T.W. and C.A.F. Rhys Davids, and was published under the “Sacred Books of the Buddhists” series under the title <cite class="book">Dialogues of the Buddha</cite>. This was a milestone in the publication of Buddhist texts, and marked the first occasion a full <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāya</i> was available in English. The translation endeavored to retain something of the literary flavor of the texts, and is accompanied by introductory essays and notes that are often useful and sometimes brilliant. But it is far from perfect, and contains many errors of both reading and interpretation. Today the insights of Rhys Davids remain valuable especially in the area of history and society.</p>
<p>An updated translation by Maurice Walshe was published by Wisdom Publications in 1987 under the title <cite class="book">Thus Have I Heard: The Long Discourses of the Buddha</cite>, a title that in later editions was changed to <cite class="book">The Long Discourses of the Buddha</cite>. The Walshe edition benefited from many decades of study and practice of Dhamma in the west. Avoiding the archaic stylings of the older translations, it remains a clear and approachable translation, with a far more accurate handling of doctrinal terms and passages. But it too is far from perfect. It relies heavily on the Rhys Davids translation, and while it corrects many errors, it sometimes repeats errors found in the older translation. Worse, it not infrequently introduces new errors.</p>
<p>In addition, there have been many translations of individual discourses and passages. Of these, the following were specially useful for my work:</p>

A special thanks is due to Sabbamittā, a true friend of all, who has tirelessly and precisely checked my work.</p>
<p>Finally my everlasting thanks to all those people, far too many to mention, who have supported SuttaCentral, and those who have supported my life as a monastic. None of this would be possible without you.</p>

<span class="blurb-content">The Long Discourses (Dīgha Nikāya, abbreviated DN) is a collection of 34 discourses in the Pali canon (Tipiṭaka) of the Theravāda school. The word “long” refers to the length of the individual discourses, not the collection as a whole, which is in fact the smallest of the five Pali Nikāyas. It is one of the fundamental collections of early Buddhist teachings, depicting the Buddha in a lively range of settings. Compared to other collections it contains more extended narratives in diverse literary styles. Many discourses feature interreligious dialog with brahmins and other non-Buddhists. This collection parallels the Dīrghāgama (DA) of the Dharmaguptaka school, which is the first text in the Taishō edition of the Chinese canon. Several uncollected suttas in Chinese and Sanskrit also belong to this collection. Two-thirds of a Dīrghāgama from the Sarvāstivāda school has been found, but only small portions have been published.</span>

<span class="blurb-content">The Chapter Containing the Section on Ethics (Sīlakkhandhavagga) is a chapter of 13 discourses. Each of these contains a long passage on the Gradual Training in ethics, meditation, and wisdom. The chapter is named after the first of these sections. The two other known versions of the Dīrghāgama (in Chinese and Sanskrit) also contain a similar chapter. Despite the monastic nature of the central teaching, most of these discourses are presented in dialog with lay people, with a strong emphasis on the relation between the Buddha’s teachings and other contemporary movements.</span>

<h3 class="subheading">1. Talk on Wanderers </h3>
<p id="dn1:1.1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was traveling along the road between Rājagaha and Nālanda together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants. The wanderer Suppiya was also traveling along the same road, together with his pupil, the brahmin student Brahmadatta. Meanwhile, Suppiya criticized the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways, but his pupil Brahmadatta praised them in many ways. And so both teacher and pupil followed behind the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants directly contradicting each other. </p>
<p id="dn1:1.2.1">Then the Buddha took up residence for the night in the royal rest-house in Ambalaṭṭhikā together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. And Suppiya and Brahmadatta did likewise. There too, Suppiya criticized the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways, but his pupil Brahmadatta praised them in many ways. And so both teacher and pupil kept on directly contradicting each other. </p>
<p id="dn1:1.3.1">Then several mendicants rose at the crack of dawn and sat together in the pavilion, where the topic of evaluation came up: </p>
<p id="dn1:1.3.2">“It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing how the diverse convictions of sentient beings have been clearly comprehended by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. For this Suppiya criticizes the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways, while his pupil Brahmadatta praises them in many ways. And so both teacher and pupil followed behind the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants directly contradicting each other.” </p>
<p id="dn1:1.4.1">When the Buddha found out about this discussion on evaluation among the mendicants, he went to the pavilion, where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?” </p>
<p id="dn1:1.4.3">The mendicants told him what had happened, adding, “This was our conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.” </p>
<p id="dn1:1.5.1">“Mendicants, if others criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, don’t make yourselves resentful, bitter, and exasperated. You’ll get angry and upset, which would be an obstacle for you alone. If others were to criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, and you got angry and upset, would you be able to understand whether they spoke well or poorly?” </p>
<p id="dn1:1.5.4">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn1:1.6.1">“If others criticize me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, you should explain that what is untrue is in fact untrue: ‘This is why that’s untrue, this is why that’s false. There’s no such thing in us, it’s not found among us.’ </p>
<p id="dn1:1.6.3">If others praise me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, don’t make yourselves thrilled, elated, and excited. You’ll get thrilled, elated, and excited, which would be an obstacle for you alone. If others praise me, the teaching, or the Saṅgha, you should acknowledge that what is true is in fact true: ‘This is why that’s true, this is why that’s correct. There is such a thing in us, it is found among us.’ </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. Ethics </h3>
<h4 class="subheading">2.1. The Shorter Section on Ethics </h4>

<h5 class="subheading">3.1.2. Partial Eternalism </h5>
<p id="dn1:2.1.1">There are some ascetics and brahmins who are partial eternalists, who assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal and partially not eternal on four grounds. And what are the four grounds on which they rely? </p>
<p id="dn1:2.2.1">There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos contracts. As the cosmos contracts, sentient beings are mostly headed for the realm of streaming radiance. There they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time. </p>
<p id="dn1:2.3.1">There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos expands. As it expands an empty mansion of Brahmā appears. Then a certain sentient being—due to the running out of their life-span or merit—passes away from that host of radiant deities and is reborn in that empty mansion of Brahmā. There they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time. </p>
<p id="dn1:2.4.1">But after staying there all alone for a long time, they become dissatisfied and anxious: ‘Oh, if only another being would come to this state of existence.’ Then other sentient beings—due to the running out of their life-span or merit—pass away from that host of radiant deities and are reborn in that empty mansion of Brahmā in company with that being. There they too are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time. </p>
<p id="dn1:2.5.1">Now, the being who was reborn there first thinks: ‘I am Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born. These beings were created by me! Why is that? Because first I thought: </p>
<p id="dn1:2.5.6">“Oh, if only another being would come to this state of existence.” Such was my heart’s wish, and then these creatures came to this state of existence.’ </p>
<p id="dn1:2.5.8">And the beings who were reborn there later also think: ‘This must be Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born. And we have been created by him. Why is that? Because we see that he was reborn here first, and we arrived later.’ </p>
<p id="dn1:2.6.1">And the being who was reborn first is more long-lived, beautiful, and illustrious than those who arrived later. </p>
<p id="dn1:2.6.3">It’s possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existence. Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to homelessness. By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus, they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life, but no further. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="dn1:2.6.6">They say: ‘He who is Brahmā—the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born—is permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity. We who were created by that Brahmā are impermanent, not lasting, short-lived, perishable, and have come to this state of existence. This is the first ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal. </p>
<p id="dn1:2.7.1">And what is the second ground on which they rely? There are gods named ‘depraved by play.’ They spend too much time laughing, playing, and making merry. And in doing so, they lose their mindfulness, and they pass away from that host of gods. </p>
<p id="dn1:2.8.1">It’s possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existence. Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to homelessness. By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus, they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life, but no further. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="dn1:2.9.1">They say: ‘The gods not depraved by play don’t spend too much time laughing, playing, and making merry. So they don’t lose their mindfulness, and don’t pass away from that host of gods. They are permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity. But we who were depraved by play spent too much time laughing, playing, and making merry. In doing so, we lost our mindfulness, and passed away from that host of gods. We are impermanent, not lasting, short-lived, perishable, and have come to this state of existence.’ This is the second ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal. </p>
<p id="dn1:2.10.1">And what is the third ground on which they rely? There are gods named ‘malevolent’. They spend too much time gazing at each other, so they grow angry with each other, and their bodies and minds get tired. They pass away from that host of gods. </p>
<p id="dn1:2.11.1">It’s possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existence. Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to homelessness. By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus, they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life, but no further. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="dn1:2.12.1">They say: ‘The gods who are not malevolent don’t spend too much time gazing at each other, so they don’t grow angry with each other, their bodies and minds don’t get tired, and they don’t pass away from that host of gods. They are permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity. But we who were malevolent spent too much time gazing at each other, we grew angry with each other, our bodies and minds got tired, and we passed away from that host of gods. We are impermanent, not lasting, short-lived, perishable, and have come to this state of existence.’ This is the third ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="dn1:2.13.1">And what is the fourth ground on which they rely? It’s when some ascetic or brahmin relies on logic and inquiry. They speak of what they have worked out by logic, following a line of inquiry, expressing their own perspective: ‘That which is called “the eye” or “the ear” or “the nose” or “the tongue” or “the body”: that self is impermanent, not lasting, transient, perishable. That which is called “mind” or “sentience” or “consciousness”: that self is permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity.’ This is the fourth ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal. </p>
<p id="dn1:2.14.1">These are the four grounds on which those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self and the cosmos are partially eternal and partially not eternal.

<p id="dn1:2.17.1">It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they meditate perceiving the cosmos as finite. </p>

They think: ‘I don’t truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful. If I were to declare that something was skillful or unskillful I might be wrong. That would be stressful for me, and that stress would be an obstacle.’ So from fear and disgust with false speech they avoid stating whether something is skillful or unskillful. Whenever they’re asked a question, they resort to evasiveness and equivocation: ‘I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so.

There are clever ascetics and brahmins who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters. You’d think they live to demolish convictions with their intellect. They might pursue, press, and grill me about that. I’d be stumped by such a grilling. That would be stressful for me, and that stress would be an obstacle.’ So from fear and disgust with examination they avoid stating whether something is skillful or unskillful.

<p id="dn1:2.30.1">There are some ascetics and brahmins who theorize about chance. They assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance on two grounds. And what are the two grounds on which they rely? </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="dn1:2.31.1">There are gods named ‘non-percipient beings’. When perception arises they pass away from that host of gods. It’s possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existence. Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to homelessness. By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus, they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect the arising of perception, but no further. They say: ‘The self and the cosmos arose by chance. Why is that? Because formerly I didn’t exist. Now, having not been, I’ve sprung into existence.’ This is the first ground on which some ascetics and brahmins rely to assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance. </p>

<p id="dn1:3.40.1">or that the self lives on after death in a neither percipient nor non-percipient form on eight grounds … </p>
<p id="dn1:3.41.1">or they assert the annihilation of an existing being on seven grounds … </p>
<p id="dn1:3.42.1">or they assert the ultimate extinguishment of an existing being in the present life on five grounds … </p>
<p id="dn1:3.43.1">they theorize about the future on these forty-four grounds … </p>
<p id="dn1:3.44.1">When those ascetics and brahmins theorize about the past and the future on these sixty-two grounds, these things are only the feeling of those who do not know or see, the agitation and evasiveness of those under the sway of craving. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">4.2. Conditioned by Contact </h4>
<p id="dn1:3.45.1">Now, these things are conditioned by contact. Namely, when those ascetics and brahmins assert that the self and the cosmos are eternal on four grounds … </p>
<p id="dn1:3.46.1">partially eternal on four grounds … </p>
<p id="dn1:3.47.1">finite or infinite on four grounds … </p>
<p id="dn1:3.48.1">or they resort to equivocation on four grounds … </p>
<p id="dn1:3.49.1">or they assert that the self and the cosmos arose by chance on two grounds … </p>
<p id="dn1:3.50.1">they theorize about the past on these eighteen grounds … </p>
<p id="dn1:3.51.1">or they assert that the self lives on after death in a percipient form on sixteen grounds … </p>
<p id="dn1:3.52.1">or that the self lives on after death in a non-percipient form on eight grounds … </p>
<p id="dn1:3.53.1">or that the self lives on after death in a neither percipient nor non-percipient form on eight grounds … </p>

<p id="dn1:3.56.1">they theorize about the future on these forty-four grounds … </p>
<p id="dn1:3.57.1">When those ascetics and brahmins theorize about the past and the future on these sixty-two grounds, that too is conditioned by contact. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">4.3. Not Possible </h4>
<p id="dn1:3.70.1">Now, when those ascetics and brahmins theorize about the past and the future on these sixty-two grounds, it is not possible that they should experience these things without contact. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">4.4. Dependent Origination </h4>
<p id="dn1:3.71.1">Now, when those ascetics and brahmins theorize about the past and the future on these sixty-two grounds, all of them experience this by repeated contact through the six fields of contact. Their feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">5. The End of the Round </h3>
<p id="dn1:3.72.1">When a mendicant truly understands the six fields of contact’s origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape, they understand what lies beyond all these things. </p>
<p id="dn1:3.72.2">All of these ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past or the future are trapped in the net of these sixty-two grounds, so that wherever they emerge they are caught and trapped in this very net. </p>
<p id="dn1:3.72.3">Suppose a deft fisherman or his apprentice were to cast a fine-meshed net over a small pond. They’d think: ‘Any sizable creatures in this pond will be trapped in the net. Wherever they emerge they are caught and trapped in this very net.’ In the same way, all of these ascetics and brahmins who theorize about the past or the future are trapped in the net of these sixty-two grounds, so that wherever they emerge they are caught and trapped in this very net. </p>
<p id="dn1:3.73.1">The Realized One’s body remains, but his conduit to rebirth has been cut off. As long as his body remains he will be seen by gods and humans. But when his body breaks up, after life has ended, gods and humans will see him no more. </p>
<p id="dn1:3.73.4">When the stalk of a bunch of mangoes is cut, all the mangoes attached to the stalk will follow along. In the same way, the Realized One’s body remains, but his conduit to rebirth has been cut off. As long as his body remains he will be seen by gods and humans. But when his body breaks up, after life has ended, gods and humans will see him no more.” </p>
<p id="dn1:3.74.1">When he had spoken, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! What is the name of this exposition of the teaching?” </p>
<p id="dn1:3.74.3">“Well, then, Ānanda, you may remember this exposition of the teaching as ‘The Net of Meaning’, or else ‘The Net of the Teaching’, or else ‘The Prime Net’, or else ‘The Net of Views’, or else ‘The Supreme Victory in Battle’.” </p>
<p id="dn1:3.74.4">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. And while this discourse was being spoken, the galaxy shook. </p>

<h3 class="subheading">1. A Discussion With the King’s Ministers </h3>
<p id="dn2:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha in the Mango Grove of Jīvaka Komārabhacca, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants. </p>
<p id="dn2:1.3">Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the Komudi full moon on the fifteenth day of the fourth month—and King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha was sitting upstairs in the royal longhouse surrounded by his ministers. </p>
<p id="dn2:1.4">Then Ajātasattu expressed this heartfelt sentiment, “Oh, sirs, this moonlit night is so very delightful, so beautiful, so glorious, so lovely, so striking. Now, what ascetic or brahmin might I pay homage to today, paying homage to whom my mind might find peace?” </p>
<p id="dn2:2.1">When he had spoken, one of the king’s ministers said to him, “Sire, Pūraṇa Kassapa leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life. Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” But when he had spoken, the king kept silent. </p>
<p id="dn2:3.1">Another of the king’s ministers said to him, “Sire, Makkhali Gosāla leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life. Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” But when he had spoken, the king kept silent. </p>
<p id="dn2:4.1">Another of the king’s ministers said to him, “Sire, Ajita Kesakambala leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life. Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” But when he had spoken, the king kept silent. </p>
<p id="dn2:5.1">Another of the king’s ministers said to him, “Sire, Pakudha Kaccāyana leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life. Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” But when he had spoken, the king kept silent. </p>
<p id="dn2:6.1">Another of the king’s ministers said to him, “Sire, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life. Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” But when he had spoken, the king kept silent. </p>
<p id="dn2:7.1">Another of the king’s ministers said to him, “Sire, Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people. He is of long standing, long gone forth; he is advanced in years and has reached the final stage of life. Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” But when he had spoken, the king kept silent. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. A Discussion With Jīvaka Komārabhacca </h3>
<p id="dn2:8.1">Now at that time Jīvaka Komārabhacca was sitting silently not far from the king. Then the king said to him, “But my dear Jīvaka, why are you silent?” </p>
<p id="dn2:8.4">“Sire, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is staying in my mango grove together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ Let Your Majesty pay homage to him. Hopefully in so doing your mind will find peace.” </p>
<p id="dn2:8.9">“Well then, my dear Jīvaka, have the elephants readied.” </p>
<p id="dn2:9.1">“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied Jīvaka. He had around five hundred female elephants readied, in addition to the king’s bull elephant for riding. Then he informed the king, “The elephants are ready, sire. Please go at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="dn2:10.1">Then King Ajātasattu had women mounted on each of the five hundred female elephants, while he mounted his bull elephant. With attendants carrying torches, he set out in full royal pomp from Rājagaha to Jīvaka’s mango grove. </p>
<p id="dn2:10.2">But as he drew near the mango grove, the king became frightened, scared, his hair standing on end. He said to Jīvaka, “My dear Jīvaka, I hope you’re not deceiving me! I hope you’re not betraying me! I hope you’re not turning me over to my enemies! For how on earth can there be no sound of coughing or clearing throats or any noise in such a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants?” </p>
<p id="dn2:10.8">“Do not fear, great king, do not fear! I am not deceiving you, or betraying you, or turning you over to your enemies. Go forward, great king, go forward! Those are lamps shining in the pavilion.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">3. The Question About the Fruits of the Ascetic Life </h3>
<p id="dn2:11.1">Then King Ajātasattu rode on the elephant as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the pavilion door on foot, where he asked Jīvaka, “But my dear Jīvaka, where is the Buddha?” </p>
<p id="dn2:11.3">“That is the Buddha, great king, that is the Buddha! He’s sitting against the central column facing east, in front of the Saṅgha of mendicants.” </p>
<p id="dn2:12.1">Then the king went up to the Buddha and stood to one side. He looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were so very silent, like a still, clear lake, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment, “May my son, Prince Udāyibhadda, be blessed with such peace as the Saṅgha of mendicants now enjoys!” </p>
<p id="dn2:12.4">“Has your mind gone to one you love, great king?” </p>
<p id="dn2:12.5">“I love my son, sir, Prince Udāyibhadda. May he be blessed with such peace as the Saṅgha of mendicants now enjoys!” </p>
<p id="dn2:13.1">Then the king bowed to the Buddha, raised his joined palms toward the Saṅgha, and sat down to one side. He said to the Buddha, “Sir, I’d like to ask you about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.” </p>
<p id="dn2:13.5">“Ask what you wish, great king.” </p>
<p id="dn2:14.1">“Sir, there are many different professional fields. These include elephant riders, cavalry, charioteers, archers, bannermen, adjutants, food servers, warrior-chiefs, princes, chargers, great warriors, heroes, leather-clad soldiers, and sons of bondservants. They also include bakers, barbers, bathroom attendants, cooks, garland-makers, dyers, weavers, basket-makers, potters, accountants, finger-talliers, or those following any similar professions. All these live off the fruits of their profession which are apparent in the present life. With that they bring happiness and joy to themselves, their parents, their children and partners, and their friends and colleagues. And they establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven. Sir, can you point out a fruit of the ascetic life that’s likewise apparent in the present life?” </p>
<p id="dn2:15.1">“Great king, do you recall having asked this question of other ascetics and brahmins?” </p>
<p id="dn2:15.2">“I do, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn2:15.3">“If you wouldn’t mind, great king, tell me how they answered.” </p>
<p id="dn2:15.4">“It’s no trouble when someone such as the Blessed One is sitting here.” </p>
<p id="dn2:15.5">“Well, speak then, great king.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">3.1. The Doctrine of Pūraṇa Kassapa </h4>
<p id="dn2:16.1">“One time, sir, I approached Pūraṇa Kassapa and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question. </p>
<p id="dn2:17.1">He said to me: ‘Great king, the one who acts does nothing wrong when they punish, mutilate, torture, aggrieve, oppress, intimidate, or when they encourage others to do the same. They do nothing wrong when they kill, steal, break into houses, plunder wealth, steal from isolated buildings, commit highway robbery, commit adultery, and lie. If you were to reduce all the living creatures of this earth to one heap and mass of flesh with a razor-edged chakram, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil. If you were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing, mutilating, and torturing, and encouraging others to do the same, no evil comes of that, and no outcome of evil. If you were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and sacrificing and encouraging others to do the same, no merit comes of that, and no outcome of merit. In giving, self-control, restraint, and truthfulness there is no merit or outcome of merit.’ </p>
<p id="dn2:18.1">And so, when I asked Pūraṇa Kassapa about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life, he answered with the doctrine of inaction. It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. I thought: ‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’ So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Pūraṇa Kassapa. I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">3.2. The Doctrine of Makkhali Gosāla </h4>
<p id="dn2:19.1">One time, sir, I approached Makkhali Gosāla and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question. </p>
<p id="dn2:20.1">He said: ‘Great king, there is no cause or reason for the corruption of sentient beings. Sentient beings are corrupted without cause or reason. There’s no cause or reason for the purification of sentient beings. Sentient beings are purified without cause or reason. One does not act of one’s own volition, one does not act of another’s volition, one does not act from a person’s volition. There is no power, no energy, no human strength or vigor. All sentient beings, all living creatures, all beings, all souls lack control, power, and energy. Molded by destiny, circumstance, and nature, they experience pleasure and pain in the six classes of rebirth. There are 1.4 million main wombs, and 6,000, and 600. There are 500 deeds, and five, and three. There are deeds and half-deeds. There are 62 paths, 62 sub-eons, six classes of rebirth, and eight stages in a person’s life. There are 4,900 Ājīvaka ascetics, 4,900 wanderers, and 4,900 naked ascetics. There are 2,000 faculties, 3,000 hells, and 36 realms of dust. There are seven percipient embryos, seven non-percipient embryos, and seven embryos without attachments. There are seven gods, seven humans, and seven goblins. There are seven lakes, seven winds, 700 winds, seven cliffs, and 700 cliffs. There are seven dreams and 700 dreams. There are 8.4 million great eons through which the foolish and the astute transmigrate before making an end of suffering. And here there is no such thing as this: “By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life I shall force unripened deeds to bear their fruit, or eliminate old deeds by experiencing their results little by little,” for that cannot be. Pleasure and pain are allotted. Transmigration lasts only for a limited period, so there’s no increase or decrease, no getting better or worse. It’s like how, when you toss a ball of string, it rolls away unraveling. In the same way, after transmigrating the foolish and the astute will make an end of suffering.’ </p>
<p id="dn2:21.1">And so, when I asked Makkhali Gosāla about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life, he answered with the doctrine of purification through transmigration. It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. I thought: ‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’ So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Makkhali Gosāla. I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">3.3. The Doctrine of Ajita Kesakambala </h4>
<p id="dn2:22.1">One time, sir, I approached Ajita Kesakambala and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question. </p>
<p id="dn2:23.1">He said: ‘Great king, there is no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight. This person is made up of the four primary elements. When they die, the earth in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of earth. The water in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of water. The fire in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of fire. The air in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of air. The faculties are transferred to space. Four men with a bier carry away the corpse. Their footprints show the way to the cemetery. The bones become bleached. Offerings dedicated to the gods end in ashes. Giving is a doctrine of morons. When anyone affirms a positive teaching it’s just hollow, false nonsense. Both the foolish and the astute are annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and don’t exist after death.’ </p>
<p id="dn2:24.1">And so, when I asked Ajita Kesakambala about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life, he answered with the doctrine of annihilationism. It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. I thought: ‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’ So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Ajita Kesakambala. I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">3.4. The Doctrine of Pakudha Kaccāyana </h4>
<p id="dn2:25.1">One time, sir, I approached Pakudha Kaccāyana and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question. </p>
<p id="dn2:26.1">He said: ‘Great king, these seven substances are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain to each other. What seven? The substances of earth, water, fire, air; pleasure, pain, and the soul is the seventh. These seven substances are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain to each other. And here there is no-one who kills or who makes others kill; no-one who learns or who educates others; no-one who understands or who helps others understand. If you chop off someone’s head with a sharp sword, you don’t take anyone’s life. The sword simply passes through the gap between the seven substances.’ </p>
<p id="dn2:27.1">And so, when I asked Pakudha Kaccāyana about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life, he answered with something else entirely. It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. I thought: ‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’ So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Pakudha Kaccāyana. I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">3.5. The Doctrine of Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta </h4>
<p id="dn2:28.1">One time, sir, I approached Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question. </p>
<p id="dn2:29.1">He said: ‘Great king, consider a Jain ascetic who is restrained in the fourfold restraint. And how is a Jain ascetic restrained in the fourfold restraint? It’s when a Jain ascetic is obstructed by all water, devoted to all water, shaking off all water, pervaded by all water. That’s how a Jain ascetic is restrained in the fourfold restraint. When a Jain ascetic is restrained in the fourfold restraint, they’re called a knotless one who is self-realized, self-controlled, and steadfast.’ </p>
<p id="dn2:30.1">And so, when I asked Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life, he answered with the fourfold restraint. It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. I thought: ‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’ So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta. I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">3.6. The Doctrine of Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta </h4>
<p id="dn2:31.1">One time, sir, I approached Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side, and asked him the same question. </p>
<p id="dn2:32.1">He said: ‘Suppose you were to ask me whether there is another world. If I believed there was, I would say so. But I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so. And I don’t deny it’s not so. Suppose you were to ask me whether there is no other world … whether there both is and is not another world … whether there neither is nor is not another world … whether there are beings who are reborn spontaneously … whether there are no beings who are reborn spontaneously … whether there both are and are not beings who are reborn spontaneously … whether there neither are nor are not beings who are reborn spontaneously … whether there is fruit and result of good and bad deeds … whether there is no fruit and result of good and bad deeds … whether there both is and is not fruit and result of good and bad deeds … whether there neither is nor is not fruit and result of good and bad deeds … whether a Realized One exists after death … whether a Realized One doesn’t exist after death … whether a Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death … whether a Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death. If I believed there was, I would say so. But I don’t say it’s like this. I don’t say it’s like that. I don’t say it’s otherwise. I don’t say it’s not so. And I don’t deny it’s not so.’ </p>
<p id="dn2:33.1">And so, when I asked Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life, he answered with evasiveness. It was like someone who, when asked about a mango, answered with a breadfruit, or when asked about a breadfruit, answered with a mango. I thought: ‘This is the most foolish and stupid of all these ascetics and brahmins! How on earth can he answer with evasiveness when asked about the fruits of the ascetic life apparent in the present life?’ I thought: ‘How could one such as I presume to rebuke an ascetic or brahmin living in my realm?’ So I neither approved nor dismissed that statement of Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta. I was displeased, but did not express my displeasure. Neither accepting what he said nor contradicting it, I got up from my seat and left. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">4. The Fruits of the Ascetic Life </h3>
<h4 class="subheading">4.1. The First Fruit of the Ascetic Life </h4>
<p id="dn2:34.1">And so I ask the Buddha: Sir, there are many different professional fields. These include elephant riders, cavalry, charioteers, archers, bannermen, adjutants, food servers, warrior-chiefs, princes, chargers, great warriors, heroes, leather-clad soldiers, and sons of bondservants. They also include bakers, barbers, bathroom attendants, cooks, garland-makers, dyers, weavers, basket-makers, potters, accountants, finger-talliers, or those following any similar professions. All these live off the fruits of their profession which are apparent in the present life. With that they bring happiness and joy to themselves, their parents, their children and partners, and their friends and colleagues. And they establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven. Sir, can you point out a fruit of the ascetic life that’s likewise apparent in the present life?” </p>
<p id="dn2:34.7">“I can, great king. Well then, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. What do you think, great king? Suppose you had a person who was a bondservant, a worker. They get up before you and go to bed after you, and are obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely, and gazing up at your face. They’d think: ‘The outcome and result of good deeds is just so incredible, so amazing! For this King Ajātasattu is a human being, and so am I. Yet he amuses himself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation as if he were a god. Whereas I’m his bondservant, his worker. I get up before him and go to bed after him, and am obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely, and gazing up at his face. I should do good deeds. Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ </p>
<p id="dn2:35.10">After some time, that is what they do. Having gone forth they’d live restrained in body, speech, and mind, living content with nothing more than food and clothes, delighting in seclusion. And suppose your men were to report all this to you. Would you say to them: ‘Bring that person to me! Let them once more be my bondservant, my worker’?” </p>
<p id="dn2:36.1">“No, sir. Rather, I would bow to them, rise in their presence, and offer them a seat. I’d invite them to accept robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And I’d organize their lawful guarding and protection.” </p>
<p id="dn2:36.3">“What do you think, great king? If this is so, is there a fruit of the ascetic life apparent in the present life or not?” </p>
<p id="dn2:36.5">“Clearly, sir, there is.” </p>
<p id="dn2:36.6">“This is the first fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life, which I point out to you.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">4.2. The Second Fruit of the Ascetic Life </h4>
<p id="dn2:37.1">“But sir, can you point out another fruit of the ascetic life that’s likewise apparent in the present life?” </p>
<p id="dn2:37.2">“I can, great king. Well then, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. What do you think, great king? Suppose you had a person who was a farmer, a householder, a hard worker, someone who builds up their capital. They’d think: ‘The outcome and result of good deeds is just so incredible, so amazing! For this King Ajātasattu is a human being, and so am I. Yet he amuses himself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation as if he were a god. Whereas I’m a farmer, a householder, a hard worker, someone who builds up their capital. I should do good deeds. Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ </p>
<p id="dn2:37.13">After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They’d shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. Having gone forth they’d live restrained in body, speech, and mind, living content with nothing more than food and clothes, delighting in seclusion. And suppose your men were to report all this to you. Would you say to them: ‘Bring that person to me! Let them once more be a farmer, a householder, a hard worker, someone who builds up their capital’?” </p>
<p id="dn2:38.1">“No, sir. Rather, I would bow to them, rise in their presence, and offer them a seat. I’d invite them to accept robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And I’d organize their lawful guarding and protection.” </p>
<p id="dn2:38.3">“What do you think, great king? If this is so, is there a fruit of the ascetic life apparent in the present life or not?” </p>
<p id="dn2:38.5">“Clearly, sir, there is.” </p>
<p id="dn2:38.6">“This is the second fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life, which I point out to you.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">4.3. The Finer Fruits of the Ascetic Life </h4>
<p id="dn2:39.1">“But sir, can you point out a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than these?” </p>
<p id="dn2:39.2">“I can, great king. Well then, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="dn2:39.4">“Yes, sir,” replied the king. </p>
<p id="dn2:39.5">The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="dn2:40.1">“Consider when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. </p>
<p id="dn2:41.1">A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in some clan. They gain faith in the Realized One, and reflect: ‘Living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ </p>
<p id="dn2:41.7">After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="dn2:42.1">Once they’ve gone forth, they live restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. They act skillfully by body and speech. They’re purified in livelihood and accomplished in ethical conduct. They guard the sense doors, have mindfulness and situational awareness, and are content. </p>

<h5 class="subheading">4.3.2. Immersion </h5>
<h6 class="subheading">4.3.2.1. Sense Restraint </h6>
<p id="dn2:64.1">And how does a mendicant guard the sense doors? When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint. When they hear a sound with their ears … When they smell an odor with their nose … When they taste a flavor with their tongue … When they feel a touch with their body … When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming.

That’s how a mendicant has mindfulness and situational awareness. </p>
<h6 class="subheading">4.3.2.3. Contentment </h6>
<p id="dn2:66.1">And how is a mendicant content? It’s when a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden. In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. That’s how a mendicant is content. </p>
<h6 class="subheading">4.3.2.4. Giving Up the Hindrances </h6>
<p id="dn2:67.1">When they have this noble spectrum of ethics, this noble sense restraint, this noble mindfulness and situational awareness, and this noble contentment, they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there. </p>
<p id="dn2:68.1">Giving up desire for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of desire, cleansing the mind of desire. Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will. Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness.

<p id="dn2:69.1">Suppose a man who has gotten into debt were to apply himself to work, and his efforts proved successful. He would pay off the original loan and have enough left over to support his partner. Thinking about this, he’d be filled with joy and happiness. </p>
<p id="dn2:70.1">Suppose there was a person who was sick, suffering, gravely ill. They’d lose their appetite and get physically weak. But after some time they’d recover from that illness, and regain their appetite and their strength. Thinking about this, they’d be filled with joy and happiness. </p>
<p id="dn2:71.1">Suppose a person was imprisoned in a jail. But after some time they were released from jail, safe and sound, with no loss of wealth. Thinking about this, they’d be filled with joy and happiness. </p>
<p id="dn2:72.1">Suppose a person was a bondservant. They belonged to someone else and were unable to go where they wish. But after some time they’d be freed from servitude and become their own master, an emancipated individual able to go where they wish. Thinking about this, they’d be filled with joy and happiness. </p>
<p id="dn2:73.1">Suppose there was a person with wealth and property who was traveling along a desert road, which was perilous, with nothing to eat. But after some time they crossed over the desert safely, arriving within a village, a sanctuary free of peril. Thinking about this, they’d be filled with joy and happiness. </p>
<p id="dn2:74.1">In the same way, as long as these five hindrances are not given up inside themselves, a mendicant regards them thus as a debt, a disease, a prison, slavery, and a desert crossing. </p>
<p id="dn2:74.2">But when these five hindrances are given up inside themselves, a mendicant regards this as freedom from debt, good health, release from prison, emancipation, and sanctuary. </p>
<p id="dn2:74.4">Seeing that the hindrances have been given up in them, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed. </p>
<h6 class="subheading">4.3.2.5. First Absorption </h6>
<p id="dn2:75.1">Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. </p>
<p id="dn2:76.1">It’s like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water. They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes out. In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. This, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones. </p>
<h6 class="subheading">4.3.2.6. Second Absorption </h6>
<p id="dn2:77.1">Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without applying the mind and keeping it connected. In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion. </p>
<p id="dn2:78.1">It’s like a deep lake fed by spring water. There’s no inlet to the east, west, north, or south, and no rainfall to replenish it from time to time. But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads throughout the lake. There’s no part of the lake that’s not spread through with cool water. </p>
<p id="dn2:78.3">In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion. This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones. </p>
<h6 class="subheading">4.3.2.7. Third Absorption </h6>
<p id="dn2:79.1">Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture. </p>
<p id="dn2:80.1">It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. From the tip to the root they’re drenched, steeped, filled, and soaked with cool water. There’s no part of them that’s not soaked with cool water. In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture. This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones. </p>
<h6 class="subheading">4.3.2.8. Fourth Absorption </h6>
<p id="dn2:81.1">Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. They sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind. </p>
<p id="dn2:82.1">It’s like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread over with white cloth. In the same way, they sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind. This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones. </p>
<h5 class="subheading">4.3.3. The Eight Knowledges </h5>
<h6 class="subheading">4.3.3.1. Knowledge and Vision </h6>
<p id="dn2:83.1">When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward knowledge and vision. They understand: ‘This body of mine is physical. It’s made up of the four primary elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction. And this consciousness of mine is attached to it, tied to it.’ </p>
<p id="dn2:84.1">Suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed with all good qualities. And it was strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown. And someone with good eyesight were to take it in their hand and check it: ‘This beryl gem is naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed with all good qualities. And it’s strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown.’ </p>

<h6 class="subheading">4.3.3.2. Mind-Made Body </h6>
<p id="dn2:85.1">When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward the creation of a mind-made body. From this body they create another body, physical, mind-made, complete in all its various parts, not deficient in any faculty. </p>
<p id="dn2:86.1">Suppose a person was to draw a reed out from its sheath. They’d think: ‘This is the reed, this is the sheath. The reed and the sheath are different things. The reed has been drawn out from the sheath.’ Or suppose a person was to draw a sword out from its scabbard. They’d think: ‘This is the sword, this is the scabbard. The sword and the scabbard are different things. The sword has been drawn out from the scabbard.’ Or suppose a person was to draw a snake out from its slough.

They wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm. </p>
<p id="dn2:88.1">Suppose an expert potter or their apprentice had some well-prepared clay. They could produce any kind of pot that they like. Or suppose a deft ivory-carver or their apprentice had some well-prepared ivory. They could produce any kind of ivory item that they like. Or suppose a deft goldsmith or their apprentice had some well-prepared gold. They could produce any kind of gold item that they like. </p>
<p id="dn2:88.4">In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward psychic power. This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones. </p>
<h6 class="subheading">4.3.3.4. Clairaudience </h6>
<p id="dn2:89.1">When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward clairaudience. With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far. </p>
<p id="dn2:90.1">Suppose there was a person traveling along the road. They’d hear the sound of drums, clay drums, horns, kettledrums, and tom-toms. They’d think: ‘That’s the sound of drums,’ and ‘that’s the sound of clay drums,’ and ‘that’s the sound of horns, kettledrums, and tom-toms.’ </p>
<p id="dn2:90.2">In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward clairaudience.

<h6 class="subheading">4.3.3.5. Comprehending the Minds of Others </h6>
<p id="dn2:91.1">When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward comprehending the minds of others. They understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind. They understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’, and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’. They understand mind with hate … mind without hate … mind with delusion … mind without delusion … constricted mind … scattered mind … expansive mind … unexpansive mind … mind that is not supreme … mind that is supreme … immersed mind … unimmersed mind … freed mind … They understand unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’. </p>
<p id="dn2:92.1">Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and they check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror or a clear bowl of water. If they had a spot they’d know ‘I have a spot,’ and if they had no spots they’d know ‘I have no spots.’ In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward comprehending the minds of others. They understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind. This too, great king, is a fruit of the ascetic life that’s apparent in the present life which is better and finer than the former ones. </p>
<h6 class="subheading">4.3.3.6. Recollection of Past Lives </h6>
<p id="dn2:93.1">When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward recollection of past lives. They recollect many kinds of past lives, that is, one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. </p>
<p id="dn2:94.1">Suppose a person was to leave their home village and go to another village. From that village they’d go to yet another village. And from that village they’d return to their home village. They’d think: ‘I went from my home village to another village. There I stood like this, sat like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. From that village I went to yet another village. There too I stood like this, sat like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. And from that village I returned to my home village.’ </p>
<p id="dn2:94.2">In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward recollection of past lives.

<h6 class="subheading">4.3.3.7. Clairvoyance </h6>
<p id="dn2:95.1">When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings. With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. </p>
<p id="dn2:96.1">Suppose there was a stilt longhouse at the central square. A person with good eyesight standing there might see people entering and leaving a house, walking along the streets and paths, and sitting at the central square.

<p id="dn2:96.2">In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend and project it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings.

<h6 class="subheading">4.3.3.8. Ending of Defilements </h6>
<p id="dn2:97.1">When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements. They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’. Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ </p>
<p id="dn2:98.1">Suppose that in a mountain glen there was a lake that was transparent, clear, and unclouded.

And, great king, there is no other fruit of the ascetic life apparent in the present life which is better and finer than this.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">5. Ajātasattu Declares Himself a Lay Follower </h3>
<p id="dn2:99.1">When the Buddha had spoken, King Ajātasattu said to him, “Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. </p>
<p id="dn2:99.6">I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to take the life of my father, a just and principled king, for the sake of authority. Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.” </p>
<p id="dn2:100.1">“Indeed, great king, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to take the life of your father, a just and principled king, for the sake of sovereignty. But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it. For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.” </p>
<p id="dn2:101.1">When the Buddha had spoken, King Ajātasattu said to him, “Well, now, sir, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.” </p>
<p id="dn2:101.3">“Please, great king, go at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="dn2:101.4">Then the king, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled him, keeping him on his right, before leaving. </p>
<p id="dn2:102.1">Soon after the king had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “The king is broken, mendicants, he is ruined. If he had not taken the life of his father, a just and principled king, the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma would have arisen in him in that very seat.” </p>
<p id="dn2:102.5">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. </p>

<h2 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">DN 3</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">With Ambaṭṭha </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Ambaṭṭhasutta</span></h2>
<p id="dn3:1.1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Icchānaṅgala. He stayed in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">1. The Section on Pokkharasāti </h3>
<p id="dn3:1.2.1">Now at that time the brahmin Pokkharasāti was living in Ukkaṭṭhā. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal endowment of the highest quality. Pokkharasāti heard: </p>
<p id="dn3:1.2.3">“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala and is staying in a forest nearby. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. The Brahmin Student Ambaṭṭha </h3>
<p id="dn3:1.3.1">Now at that time Pokkharasāti had a student named Ambaṭṭha. He was one who recited and remembered the hymns, and had mastered in the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knew philology and grammar, and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. He had been authorized as a master in his own teacher’s scriptural heritage of the three Vedas with the words: “What I know, you know. And what you know, I know.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.4.1">Then Pokkharasāti addressed Ambaṭṭha, “Dear Ambaṭṭha, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala and is staying in a forest nearby. … It’s good to see such perfected ones. Please, dear Ambaṭṭha, go to the ascetic Gotama and find out whether or not he lives up to his reputation. Through you I shall learn about Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.5.1">“But sir, how shall I find out whether or not the ascetic Gotama lives up to his reputation?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.5.2">“Dear Ambaṭṭha, the thirty-two marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other. If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures. He has the following seven treasures: the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure. He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword. But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world. But, dear Ambaṭṭha, I am the one who gives the hymns, and you are the one who receives them.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.6.1">“Yes, sir,” replied Ambaṭṭha. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled Pokkharasāti, keeping him to his right. He mounted a mare-drawn chariot and, together with several students, set out for the forest near Icchānaṅgala. He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot. </p>
<p id="dn3:1.7.1">At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air. Then the student Ambaṭṭha went up to those mendicants and said, “Gentlemen, where is Master Gotama at present? For we have come here to see him.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.8.1">Then those mendicants thought, “This Ambaṭṭha is from a well-known family, and he is the pupil of the well-known brahmin Pokkharasāti. The Buddha won’t mind having a discussion together with such gentlemen.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.8.4">They said to Ambaṭṭha, “Ambaṭṭha, that’s his dwelling, with the door closed. Approach it quietly, without hurrying; go onto the porch, clear your throat, and knock with the latch. The Buddha will open the door.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.9.1">So he approached the Buddha’s dwelling and knocked, and the Buddha opened the door. Ambaṭṭha and the other students entered the dwelling. The other students exchanged greetings with the Buddha, and when the greetings and polite conversation were over, sat down to one side. But while the Buddha was sitting, Ambaṭṭha spoke some polite words or other while walking around or standing. </p>
<p id="dn3:1.9.4">So the Buddha said to him, “Ambaṭṭha, is this how you hold a discussion with elderly and senior brahmins, the teachers of teachers: walking around or standing while I’m sitting, speaking some polite words or other?” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.1. The First Use of the Word “Riffraff” </h4>
<p id="dn3:1.10.1">“No, Master Gotama. For it is proper for one brahmin to converse with another while both are walking, standing, sitting, or lying down. But as to these shavelings, fake ascetics, riffraff, black spawn from the feet of our kinsman, I converse with them as I do with Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.11.1">“But Ambaṭṭha, you must have come here for some purpose. You should focus on that. Though this Ambaṭṭha is unqualified, he thinks he’s qualified. What is that but lack of qualifications?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.12.1">When he said this, Ambaṭṭha became angry and upset with the Buddha because of being described as unqualified. He even attacked and badmouthed the Buddha himself, saying, “The ascetic Gotama will be worsted!” He said to the Buddha, “Master Gotama, the Sakyan clan are rude, harsh, touchy, and argumentative. Riffraff they are, and riffraff they remain! They don’t honor, respect, revere, worship, or venerate brahmins. It is neither proper nor appropriate that the Sakyans—riffraff that they are—don’t honor, respect, revere, worship, or venerate brahmins.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.12.9">And that’s how Ambaṭṭha denigrated the Sakyans with the word “riffraff” for the first time. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.2. The Second Use of the Word “Riffraff” </h4>
<p id="dn3:1.13.1">“But Ambaṭṭha, how have the Sakyans wronged you?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.13.2">“This one time, Master Gotama, I went to Kapilavatthu on some business for my teacher, the brahmin Pokkharasāti. I approached the Sakyans in their meeting hall. Now at that time several Sakyans and Sakyan princes were sitting on high seats, poking each other with their fingers, giggling and playing together. In fact, they even presumed to giggle at me, and didn’t invite me to a seat. It is neither proper nor appropriate that the Sakyans—riffraff that they are—don’t honor, respect, revere, worship, or venerate brahmins.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.13.6">And that’s how Ambaṭṭha denigrated the Sakyans with the word “riffraff” for the second time. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.3. The Third Use of the Word “Riffraff” </h4>
<p id="dn3:1.14.1">“Even a little quail, Ambaṭṭha, speaks as she likes in her own nest. Kapilavatthu is the Sakyans own place, Ambaṭṭha. It’s not worthy of the Venerable Ambaṭṭha to lose his temper over such a small thing.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.14.3">“Master Gotama, there are these four castes: aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers. Three of these castes—aristocrats, merchants, and workers—in fact succeed only in serving the brahmins. It is neither proper nor appropriate that the Sakyans—riffraff that they are—don’t honor, respect, revere, worship, or venerate brahmins.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.14.9">And that’s how Ambaṭṭha denigrated the Sakyans with the word “riffraff” for the third time. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.4. The Word “Son of Bondservants” is Used </h4>
<p id="dn3:1.15.1">Then it occurred to the Buddha, “This Ambaṭṭha puts the Sakyans down too much by calling them riffraff. Why don’t I ask him about his own clan?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.15.3">So the Buddha said to him, “What is your clan, Ambaṭṭha?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.15.5">“I am a Kaṇhāyana, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.15.6">“But, recollecting the ancient name and clan of your mother and father, the Sakyans were the children of the masters, while you’re descended from the son of a female bondservant of the Sakyans. But the Sakyans regard King Okkāka as their grandfather. </p>
<p id="dn3:1.15.8">Once upon a time, King Okkāka, wishing to divert the royal succession to the son of his most beloved queen, banished the elder princes from the realm—Okkāmukha, Karakaṇḍa, Hatthinika, and Sinisūra. They made their home beside a lotus pond on the slopes of the Himalayas, where there was a large teak grove. For fear of diluting their lineage, they slept with their own sisters. </p>
<p id="dn3:1.15.12">Then King Okkāka addressed his ministers and counselors, ‘Where, sirs, have the princes settled now?’ </p>
<p id="dn3:1.15.14">‘Sire, there is a lotus pond on the slopes of the Himalayas, by a large grove of <i lang="pi" translate="no">sāka</i>, the teak tree. They’ve settled there. For fear of diluting their lineage, they are sleeping with their own (<i lang="pi" translate="no">saka</i>) sisters.’ </p>
<p id="dn3:1.15.16">Then, Ambaṭṭha, King Okkāka expressed this heartfelt sentiment: ‘The princes are indeed Sakyans! The princes are indeed the best Sakyans!’ From that day on the Sakyans were recognized, and he was their founder. </p>
<p id="dn3:1.16.1">Now, King Okkāka had a female bondservant named Disā. She gave birth to a black boy. When he was born, Black Boy said: ‘Wash me, mum, bathe me! Get this filth off of me! I will be useful for you!’ Whereas these days when people see goblins they know them as goblins, in those days they knew goblins as ‘blackboys’. </p>
<p id="dn3:1.16.7">They said: ‘He spoke as soon as he was born—a blackboy is born! A goblin is born!’ From that day on the Kaṇhāyanas were recognized, and he was their founder. That’s how, recollecting the ancient name and clan of your mother and father, the Sakyans were the children of the masters, while you’re descended from the son of a female bondservant of the Sakyans.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.17.1">When he said this, those students said to him, “Master Gotama, please don’t put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a bondservant. He’s well-born, a gentleman, learned, a good speaker, and astute. He’s capable of having a dialogue with Master Gotama about this.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.18.1">So the Buddha said to them, “Well, students, if you think that Ambaṭṭha is ill-born, not a gentleman, unlearned, a poor speaker, witless, and not capable of having a dialogue with me about this, then leave him aside and you can have a dialogue with me. But if you think that he’s well-born, a gentleman, learned, a good speaker, astute, and capable of having a dialogue with me about this, then you should stand aside and let him have a dialogue with me.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.19.1">“He is capable of having a dialogue. We will be silent, and let Ambaṭṭha have a dialogue with Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.20.1">So the Buddha said to Ambaṭṭha, “Well, Ambaṭṭha, there’s a legitimate question that comes up. You won’t like it, but you ought to answer anyway. If you don’t answer, but dodge the issue, remain silent, or simply leave, your head will explode into seven pieces right here. What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? According to what you have heard from elderly and senior brahmins, the teachers of teachers, what is the origin of the Kaṇhāyanas, and who is their founder?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.20.6">When he said this, Ambaṭṭha kept silent. </p>
<p id="dn3:1.20.7">For a second time, the Buddha put the question, and for a second time Ambaṭṭha kept silent. </p>
<p id="dn3:1.20.10">So the Buddha said to him, “Answer now, Ambaṭṭha. Now is not the time for silence. If someone fails to answer a legitimate question when asked three times by the Buddha, their head explodes into seven pieces there and then.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.21.1">Now at that time the spirit Vajirapāṇi, holding a massive iron spear, burning, blazing, and glowing, stood in the sky above Ambaṭṭha, thinking, “If this Ambaṭṭha doesn’t answer when asked a third time, I’ll blow his head into seven pieces there and then!” And both the Buddha and Ambaṭṭha could see Vajirapāṇi. </p>
<p id="dn3:1.21.4">Ambaṭṭha was terrified, shocked, and awestruck. Looking to the Buddha for shelter, protection, and refuge, he sat down close by the Buddha and said, “What did you say? Please repeat the question.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.21.7">“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? According to what you have heard from elderly and senior brahmins, the teachers of teachers, what is the origin of the Kaṇhāyanas, and who is their founder?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.21.9">“I have heard, Master Gotama, that it is just as you say. That’s the origin of the Kaṇhāyanas, and that’s who their founder is.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.5. The Discussion of Ambaṭṭha’s Heritage </h4>
<p id="dn3:1.22.1">When he said this, those students made an uproar, “It turns out Ambaṭṭha is ill-born, not a gentleman, son of a Sakyan bondservant, and that the Sakyans are sons of his masters! And it seems that the ascetic Gotama spoke only the truth, though we presumed to rebuke him!” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.23.1">Then it occurred to the Buddha, “These students put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a bondservant. Why don’t I get him out of this?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.23.3">So the Buddha said to the students, “Students, please don’t put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a bondservant. That Black Boy was an eminent sage. He went to a southern country and memorized the Prime Spell. Then he approached King Okkāka and asked for the hand of his daughter Maddarūpī. </p>
<p id="dn3:1.23.7">The king said to him, ‘Who the hell is this son of a bondservant to ask for the hand of my daughter!’ Angry and upset he fastened a razor-tipped arrow. But he wasn’t able to either shoot it or to relax it. </p>
<p id="dn3:1.23.10">Then the ministers and counselors approached the sage Black Boy and said: ‘Spare the king, sir, spare him!’ </p>
<p id="dn3:1.23.13">‘The king will be safe. But if he shoots the arrow downwards, there will be an earthquake across the entire realm.’ </p>
<p id="dn3:1.23.14">‘Spare the king, sir, and spare the country!’ </p>
<p id="dn3:1.23.15">‘Both king and country will be safe. But if he shoots the arrow upwards, there will be no rain in the entire realm for seven years.’ </p>
<p id="dn3:1.23.16">‘Spare the king, sir, spare the country, and let there be rain!’ </p>
<p id="dn3:1.23.17">‘Both king and country will be safe, and the rain will fall. And if the king aims the arrow at the crown prince, he will be safe and untouched.’ </p>
<p id="dn3:1.23.18">So the ministers said to Okkāka: ‘Okkāka must aim the arrow at the crown prince. He will be safe and untouched.’ </p>
<p id="dn3:1.23.20">So King Okkāka aimed the arrow at the crown prince. And he was safe and untouched. Then the king was terrified, shocked, and awestruck. Scared by the prime punishment, he gave the hand of his daughter Maddarūpī. </p>
<p id="dn3:1.23.22">Students, please don’t put Ambaṭṭha down too much by calling him the son of a bondservant. That Black Boy was an eminent sage.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">3. The Supremacy of the Aristocrats </h3>
<p id="dn3:1.24.1">Then the Buddha addressed Ambaṭṭha, “What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Suppose an aristocrat boy was to sleep with a brahmin girl, and they had a son. Would he receive a seat and water from the brahmins?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.24.5">“He would, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.24.6">“And would the brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors, an offering of a dish of milk-rice, a sacrifice, or a feast for guests?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.24.7">“They would.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.24.8">“And would the brahmins teach him the hymns or not?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.24.9">“They would.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.24.10">“And would he be kept from the women or not?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.24.11">“He would not.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.24.12">“And would the aristocrats anoint him as king?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.24.13">“No, Master Gotama. Why is that? Because his maternity is unsuitable.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.25.1">“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Suppose a brahmin boy was to sleep with an aristocrat girl, and they had a son. Would he receive a seat and water from the brahmins?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.25.4">“He would, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.25.5">“And would the brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors, an offering of a dish of milk-rice, a sacrifice, or a feast for guests?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.25.6">“They would.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.25.7">“And would the brahmins teach him the hymns or not?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.25.8">“They would.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.25.9">“And would he be kept from the women or not?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.25.10">“He would not.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.25.11">“And would the aristocrats anoint him as king?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.25.12">“No, Master Gotama. Why is that? Because his paternity is unsuitable.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.26.1">“And so, Ambaṭṭha, the aristocrats are superior and the brahmins inferior, whether comparing women with women or men with men. What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Suppose the brahmins for some reason were to shave a brahmin’s head, inflict him with a sack of ashes, and banish him from the nation or the city. Would he receive a seat and water from the brahmins?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.26.5">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.26.6">“And would the brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors, an offering of a dish of milk-rice, a sacrifice, or a feast for guests?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.26.7">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.26.8">“And would the brahmins teach him the hymns or not?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.26.9">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.26.10">“And would he be kept from the women or not?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.26.11">“He would be.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.27.1">“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Suppose the aristocrats for some reason were to shave an aristocrat’s head, inflict him with a sack of ashes, and banish him from the nation or the city. Would he receive a seat and water from the brahmins?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.27.4">“He would, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.27.5">“And would the brahmins feed him at an offering of food for ancestors, an offering of a dish of milk-rice, a sacrifice, or a feast for guests?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.27.6">“They would.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.27.7">“And would the brahmins teach him the hymns or not?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.27.8">“They would.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.27.9">“And would he be kept from the women or not?” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.27.10">“He would not.” </p>
<p id="dn3:1.27.11">“At this point, Ambaṭṭha, that aristocrat has reached rock bottom, with head shaven, inflicted with a sack of ashes, and banished from city or nation. Yet still the aristocrats are superior and the brahmins inferior. Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra also spoke this verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn3:1.28.2">‘The aristocrat is first among people <br/>who take clan as the standard. <br/>But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct <br/>is first among gods and humans.’ </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn3:1.28.6">That verse was well sung by Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra, not poorly sung; well spoken, not poorly spoken, beneficial, not harmful, and it was approved by me. For I also say this: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn3:1.28.8">The aristocrat is first among people <br/>who take clan as the standard. <br/>But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct <br/>is first among gods and humans.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="endsection" id="dn3:1.28.12">The first recitation section. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">4. Knowledge and Conduct </h3>
<p id="dn3:2.1.1">“But what, Master Gotama, is that conduct, and what is that knowledge?” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.1.2">“Ambaṭṭha, in the supreme knowledge and conduct there is no discussion of ancestry or clan or pride—‘You deserve me’ or ‘You don’t deserve me.’ Wherever there is giving and taking in marriage there is such discussion. Whoever is attached to questions of ancestry or clan or pride, or to giving and taking in marriage, is far from the supreme knowledge and conduct. The realization of supreme knowledge and conduct occurs when you’ve given up such things.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.2.1">“But what, Master Gotama, is that conduct, and what is that knowledge?” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.2.2">“Ambaṭṭha, it’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in some clan. They gain faith in the Realized One, and reflect … </p>
<p id="dn3:2.2.8">Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption … This pertains to their conduct. </p>
<p id="dn3:2.2.10">Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption … This pertains to their conduct. </p>
<p id="dn3:2.2.12">Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption … This pertains to their conduct. </p>
<p id="dn3:2.2.14">Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption … This pertains to their conduct. This is that conduct. </p>
<p id="dn3:2.2.17">When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward knowledge and vision. This pertains to their knowledge. … They understand: ‘There is no return to any state of existence.’ This pertains to their knowledge. This is that knowledge. </p>
<p id="dn3:2.2.22">This mendicant is said to be ‘accomplished in knowledge’, and also ‘accomplished in conduct’, and also ‘accomplished in knowledge and conduct’. And, Ambaṭṭha, there is no accomplishment in knowledge and conduct that is better or finer than this. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">5. Four Drains </h3>
<p id="dn3:2.3.1">There are these four drains that affect this supreme knowledge and conduct. What four? Firstly, take some ascetic or brahmin who, not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct, plunges into a wilderness region carrying their stuff with a shoulder-pole, thinking they will get by eating fallen fruit. In fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conduct. This is the first drain that affects this supreme knowledge and conduct. </p>
<p id="dn3:2.3.7">Furthermore, take some ascetic or brahmin who, not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct or to get by eating fallen fruit, plunges into a wilderness region carrying a spade and basket, thinking they will get by eating tubers and fruit. In fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conduct. This is the second drain that affects this supreme knowledge and conduct. </p>
<p id="dn3:2.3.11">Furthermore, take some ascetic or brahmin who, not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct, or to get by eating fallen fruit, or to get by eating tubers and fruit, sets up a fire chamber in the neighborhood of a village or town and dwells there serving the sacred flame. In fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conduct. This is the third drain that affects this supreme knowledge and conduct. </p>
<p id="dn3:2.3.14">Furthermore, take some ascetic or brahmin who, not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct, or to get by eating fallen fruit, or to get by eating tubers and fruit, or to serve the sacred flame, sets up a fire chamber in the central square and dwells there, thinking: ‘When an ascetic or brahmin comes from the four quarters, I will honor them as best I can.’ In fact they succeed only in serving someone accomplished in knowledge and conduct. This is the fourth drain that affects this supreme knowledge and conduct. These are the four drains that affect this supreme knowledge and conduct. </p>
<p id="dn3:2.4.1">What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Is this supreme knowledge and conduct seen in your own tradition?” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.4.3">“No, Master Gotama. Who am I and my tradition compared with the supreme knowledge and conduct? We are far from that.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.4.6">“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Since you’re not managing to obtain this supreme knowledge and conduct, have you with your tradition plunged into a wilderness region carrying your stuff with a shoulder-pole, thinking you will get by eating fallen fruit?” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.4.9">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.4.10">“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Have you with your tradition … plunged into a wilderness region carrying a spade and basket, thinking you will get by eating tubers and fruit?” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.4.13">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.4.14">“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Have you with your tradition … set up a fire chamber in the neighborhood of a village or town and dwelt there serving the sacred flame?” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.4.16">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.4.17">“What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Have you with your tradition … set up a fire chamber in the central square and dwelt there, thinking: ‘When an ascetic or brahmin comes from the four quarters, I will honor them as best I can’?” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.4.20">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.5.1">“So you with your tradition are not only inferior to the supreme knowledge and conduct, you are even inferior to the four drains that affect the supreme knowledge and conduct. But you have been told this by your teacher, the brahmin Pokkharasāti: ‘Who are these shavelings, fake ascetics, riffraff, black spawn from the feet of our kinsman compared with conversation with the brahmins of the three knowledges?” Yet he himself has not even fulfilled one of the drains! See, Ambaṭṭha, how your teacher Pokkharasāti has wronged you. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">6. Being Like the Sages of the Past </h3>
<p id="dn3:2.6.1">But Pokkharasāti lives off an endowment provided by King Pasenadi of Kosala. But the king won’t even grant him an audience face to face. When he consults, he does so behind a curtain. Why wouldn’t the king grant a face to face audience with someone who’d receive his legitimate presentation of food? See, Ambaṭṭha, how your teacher Pokkharasāti has wronged you. </p>
<p id="dn3:2.7.1">What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? Suppose King Pasenadi was holding consultations with warrior-chiefs or chieftains while sitting on an elephant’s neck or on horseback, or while standing on the mat in a chariot. And suppose he’d get down from that place and stand aside. Then along would come a worker or their bondservant, who’d stand in the same place and continue the consultation: ‘This is what King Pasenadi says, and this too is what the king says.’ Though he spoke the king’s words and gave the king’s advice, does that qualify him to be the king or the king’s minister?” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.7.8">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.8.1">“In the same way, Ambaṭṭha, the brahmin seers of the past were Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu. They were the authors and propagators of the hymns. Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times; and these days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it, chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taught. You might imagine that, since you’ve learned their hymns by heart in your own tradition, that makes you a hermit or someone on the path to becoming a hermit. But that is not possible. </p>
<p id="dn3:2.9.1">What do you think, Ambaṭṭha? According to what you have heard from elderly and senior brahmins, the teachers of teachers, did those ancient brahmin hermits—nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed, bedecked with jewels, earrings, and bracelets, dressed in white—amuse themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, like you do today in your tradition?” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.9.5">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.10.1">“Did they eat boiled fine rice, garnished with clean meat, with the dark grains picked out, served with many soups and sauces, like you do today in your tradition?” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.10.3">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.10.4">“Did they amuse themselves with girls wearing thongs that show off their curves, like you do today in your tradition?” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.10.6">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.10.7">“Did they drive about in chariots drawn by mares with plaited manes, whipping and lashing them onward with long goads, like you do today in your tradition?” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.10.9">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.10.10">“Did they get men with long swords to guard them in fortresses with moats dug and barriers in place, like you do today in your tradition?” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.10.12">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.10.13">“So, Ambaṭṭha, in your own tradition you are neither hermit nor someone on the path to becoming a hermit. Whoever has any doubt or uncertainty about me, let them ask me and I will clear up their doubts with my answer.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">7. Seeing the Two Marks </h3>
<p id="dn3:2.11.1">Then the Buddha came out of his dwelling and proceeded to begin walking mindfully, and Ambaṭṭha did likewise. Then while walking beside the Buddha, Ambaṭṭha scrutinized his body for the thirty-two marks of a great man. He saw all of them except for two, which he had doubts about: whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue. </p>
<p id="dn3:2.12.1">Then it occurred to the Buddha, “This brahmin student Ambaṭṭha sees all the marks except for two, which he has doubts about: whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.” Then the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Ambaṭṭha would see his private parts covered in a foreskin. And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his tongue. </p>
<p id="dn3:2.12.7">Then Ambaṭṭha thought, “The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks completely, lacking none.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.12.9">He said to the Buddha, “Well, now, sir, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.12.11">“Please, Ambaṭṭha, go at your convenience.” Then Ambaṭṭha mounted his mare-drawn chariot and left. </p>
<p id="dn3:2.13.1">Now at that time the brahmin Pokkharasāti had come out from Ukkaṭṭhā together with a large group of brahmins and was sitting in his own park just waiting for Ambaṭṭha. Then Ambaṭṭha entered the park. He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the brahmin Pokkharasāti on foot. He bowed and sat down to one side, and Pokkharasāti said to him: </p>
<p id="dn3:2.14.2">“I hope, dear Ambaṭṭha, you saw the Master Gotama?” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.14.3">“I saw him, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.14.4">“Well, does he live up to his reputation or not?” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.14.6">“He does, sir. Master Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks completely, lacking none.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.14.8">“And did you have some discussion with him?” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.14.9">“I did.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.14.10">“And what kind of discussion did you have with him?” Then Ambaṭṭha informed Pokkharasāti of all they had discussed. </p>
<p id="dn3:2.15.1">Then Pokkharasāti said to Ambaṭṭha, “Oh, our bloody fake scholar, our fake learned man, who pretends to be proficient in the three Vedas! A man who behaves like this ought, when their body breaks up, after death, to be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. It’s only because you repeatedly attacked Master Gotama like that that he kept bringing up charges against us!” Angry and upset, he kicked Ambaṭṭha over, and wanted to go and see the Buddha right away. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">8. Pokkharasāti Visits the Buddha </h3>
<p id="dn3:2.16.1">Then those brahmins said to Pokkharasāti, “It’s much too late to visit the ascetic Gotama today. You can visit him tomorrow.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.16.4">So Pokkharasāti had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. Then he mounted a carriage and, with attendants carrying torches, set out from Ukkaṭṭhā for the forest near Icchānaṅgala. He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot. He went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, “Master Gotama, has my pupil, the student Ambaṭṭha, come here?” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.17.3">“Yes he has, brahmin.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.17.4">“And did you have some discussion with him?” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.17.5">“I did.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.17.6">“And what kind of discussion did you have with him?” Then the Buddha informed Pokkharasāti of all they had discussed. </p>
<p id="dn3:2.17.8">Then Pokkharasāti said to the Buddha, “Ambaṭṭha is a fool, Master Gotama. Please forgive him.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.17.10">“May the student Ambaṭṭha be happy, brahmin.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.18.1">Then Pokkharasāti scrutinized the Buddha’s body for the thirty-two marks of a great man. He saw all of them except for two, which he had doubts about: whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue. </p>
<p id="dn3:2.18.5">Then it occurred to the Buddha, “Pokkharasāti sees all the marks except for two, which he has doubts about: whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.” Then the Buddha used his psychic power to will that Pokkharasāti would see his private parts covered in a foreskin. And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his tongue. </p>
<p id="dn3:2.19.1">Pokkharasāti thought, “The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks completely, lacking none.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.19.3">He said to the Buddha, “Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept today’s meal from me?” The Buddha consented in silence. </p>
<p id="dn3:2.20.1">Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Pokkharasāti announced the time to him, “It’s time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.” Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of Pokkharasāti together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Pokkharasāti served and satisfied the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods, while his students served the Saṅgha. When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Pokkharasāti took a low seat and sat to one side. </p>
<p id="dn3:2.21.1">Then the Buddha taught him step by step, with a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation. And when the Buddha knew that Pokkharasāti’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the brahmin Pokkharasāti: “Everything that has a beginning has an end.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">9. Pokkharasāti Declares Himself a Lay Follower </h3>
<p id="dn3:2.22.1">Then Pokkharasāti saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha, “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, just so has Master Gotama made the Teaching clear in many ways. Together with my children, wives, retinue, and ministers, I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. </p>
<p id="dn3:2.22.6">Just as Master Gotama visits other devoted families in Ukkaṭṭhā, may he visit mine. The brahmin boys and girls there will bow to you, rise in your presence, give you a seat and water, and gain confidence in their hearts. That will be for their lasting welfare and happiness.” </p>
<p id="dn3:2.22.8">“That’s good of you to say, householder.” </p>

<h3 class="subheading">1. The Brahmins and Householders of Campā </h3>
<p id="dn4:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Aṅgas together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants when he arrived at Campā, where he stayed by the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. </p>
<p id="dn4:1.4">Now at that time the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa was living in Campā. It was a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal endowment of the highest quality. </p>
<p id="dn4:2.1">The brahmins and householders of Campā heard: </p>
<p id="dn4:2.2">“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Campā and is staying on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.” Then, having departed Campā, they formed into companies and headed to the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. </p>
<p id="dn4:3.1">Now at that time the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap. He saw the brahmins and householders heading for the lotus pond, and addressed his steward, “My steward, why are the brahmins and householders headed for the Gaggarā Lotus Pond?” </p>
<p id="dn4:3.5">“The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Campā and is staying on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ They’re going to see that Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn4:3.9">“Well then, go to the brahmins and householders and say to them: ‘Sirs, the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa asks you to wait, as he will also go to see the ascetic Gotama.’” </p>
<p id="dn4:3.12">“Yes, sir,” replied the steward, and did as he was asked. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. The Qualities of Soṇadaṇḍa </h3>
<p id="dn4:4.1">Now at that time around five hundred brahmins from abroad were residing in Campā on some business. They heard that the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa was going to see the ascetic Gotama. They approached Soṇadaṇḍa and said to him, “Is it really true that you are going to see the ascetic Gotama?” </p>
<p id="dn4:4.6">“Yes, gentlemen, it is true.” </p>
<p id="dn4:5.1">“Please don’t, master Soṇadaṇḍa! It’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama. For if you do so, your reputation will diminish and his will increase. For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama; it’s appropriate that he comes to see you. </p>
<p id="dn4:5.6">You are well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation. For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama; it’s appropriate that he comes to see you. </p>
<p id="dn4:5.9">You’re rich, affluent, and wealthy. … </p>
<p id="dn4:5.10">You recite and remember the hymns, and have mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. You know philology and grammar, and are well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. … </p>

<p id="dn4:5.14">You teach the teachers of many, and teach three hundred students to recite the hymns. Many students come from various districts and countries for the sake of the hymns, wishing to learn the hymns. … </p>
<p id="dn4:5.15">You’re old, elderly and senior, advanced in years, and have reached the final stage of life. The ascetic Gotama is young, and has newly gone forth. … </p>

<p id="dn4:5.18">and the brahmin Pokkharasāti. … </p>
<p id="dn4:5.19">You live in Campā, a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal endowment of the highest quality. For this reason, too, it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama; it’s appropriate that he comes to see you. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">3. The Qualities of the Buddha </h3>
<p id="dn4:6.1">When they had spoken, Soṇadaṇḍa said to those brahmins: </p>
<p id="dn4:6.2">“Well then, gentlemen, listen to why it’s appropriate for me to go to see the ascetic Gotama, and it’s not appropriate for him to come to see me. He is well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation. For this reason it’s not appropriate for the ascetic Gotama to come to see me; rather, it’s appropriate for me to go to see him. </p>
<p id="dn4:6.7">When he went forth he abandoned a large family circle. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.8">When he went forth he abandoned abundant gold coin and bullion stored in dungeons and towers. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.9">He went forth from the lay life to homelessness while still a youth, young, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.10">Though his mother and father wished otherwise, weeping with tearful faces, he shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.11">He is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He is magnificent, splendid, remarkable to behold. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.12">He is ethical, possessing ethical conduct that is noble and skillful. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.13">He’s a good speaker, with a polished, clear, and articulate voice that expresses the meaning. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.14">He’s a teacher of teachers. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.15">He has ended sensual desire, and is rid of caprice. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.16">He teaches the efficacy of deeds and action. He doesn’t wish any harm upon the community of brahmins. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.17">He went forth from an eminent family of unbroken aristocratic lineage. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.18">He went forth from a rich, affluent, and wealthy family. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.19">People come from distant lands and distant countries to question him. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.20">Many thousands of deities have gone for refuge for life to him. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.21">He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.23">He has the thirty-two marks of a great man. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.24">He is welcoming, congenial, polite, smiling, open, the first to speak. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.25">He’s honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by the four assemblies. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.26">Many gods and humans are devoted to him. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.27">While he is residing in a village or town, non-human entities do not harass them. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.28">He leads an order and a community, and teaches a community, and is said to be the best of the various religious founders. He didn’t come by his fame in the same ways as those other ascetics and brahmins. Rather, he came by his fame due to his supreme knowledge and conduct. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.30">King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.31">King Pasenadi of Kosala and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.32">The brahmin Pokkharasāti and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. … </p>

<p id="dn4:6.34">King Pasenadi of Kosala … </p>
<p id="dn4:6.35">and the brahmin Pokkharasāti. </p>
<p id="dn4:6.36">The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Campā and is staying at the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. Any ascetic or brahmin who comes to stay in our village district is our guest, and should be honored and respected as such. For this reason, too, it’s not appropriate for Master Gotama to come to see me; rather, it’s appropriate for me to go to see him. This is the extent of Master Gotama’s praise that I have learned. But his praises are not confined to this, for the praise of Master Gotama is limitless.” </p>
<p id="dn4:6.45">When he had spoken, those brahmins said to him, “According to Soṇadaṇḍa’s praises, if Master Gotama were staying within a hundred leagues, it’d be worthwhile for a faithful gentleman to go to see him, even if he had to carry his own provisions in a shoulder bag.” </p>
<p id="dn4:6.47">“Well then, gentlemen, let’s all go to see the ascetic Gotama.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">4. Soṇadaṇḍa’s Second Thoughts </h3>
<p id="dn4:7.1">Then Soṇadaṇḍa together with a large group of brahmins went to see the Buddha. </p>
<p id="dn4:8.1">But as he reached the far side of the forest, this thought came to mind, “Suppose I was to ask the ascetic Gotama a question. He might say to me: ‘Brahmin, you shouldn’t ask your question like that. This is how you should ask it.’ And the assembly might disparage me for that: ‘Soṇadaṇḍa is foolish and incompetent. He’s not able to properly ask the ascetic Gotama a question.’ And when you’re disparaged by the assembly, your reputation diminishes. When your reputation diminishes, your wealth also diminishes. But my wealth relies on my reputation. </p>
<p id="dn4:8.9">Or if the ascetic Gotama asks me a question, I might not satisfy him with my answer. He might say to me: ‘Brahmin, you shouldn’t answer the question like that. This is how you should answer it.’ And the assembly might disparage me for that: ‘Soṇadaṇḍa is foolish and incompetent. He’s not able to satisfy the ascetic Gotama’s mind with his answer.’ And when you’re disparaged by the assembly, your reputation diminishes. When your reputation diminishes, your wealth also diminishes. But my wealth relies on my reputation. </p>
<p id="dn4:8.16">On the other hand, if I were to turn back after having come so far without having seen the ascetic Gotama, the assembly might disparage me for that: ‘Soṇadaṇḍa is foolish and incompetent. He’s stuck-up and scared. He doesn’t dare to go and see the ascetic Gotama. For how on earth can he turn back after having come so far without having seen the ascetic Gotama!’ And when you’re disparaged by the assembly, your reputation diminishes. When your reputation diminishes, your wealth also diminishes. But my wealth relies on my reputation.” </p>
<p id="dn4:9.1">Then Soṇadaṇḍa went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Before sitting down to one side, some of the brahmins and householders of Campā bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. </p>
<p id="dn4:10.1">But while sitting there, Soṇadaṇḍa continued to be plagued by many second thoughts. He thought, “If only the ascetic Gotama would ask me about my own teacher’s scriptural heritage of the three Vedas! Then I could definitely satisfy his mind with my answer.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">5. What Makes a Brahmin </h3>
<p id="dn4:11.1">Then the Buddha, knowing what Soṇadaṇḍa was thinking, thought, “This brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa is worried by his own thoughts. Why don’t I ask him about his own teacher’s scriptural heritage of the three Vedas?” </p>
<p id="dn4:11.4">So he said to Soṇadaṇḍa, “Brahmin, how many factors must a brahmin possess for the brahmins to describe him as a brahmin; and so that when he says ‘I am a brahmin’ he speaks rightly, without falling into falsehood?” </p>
<p id="dn4:12.1">Then Soṇadaṇḍa thought, “The ascetic Gotama has asked me about exactly what I wanted, what I wished for, what I desired, what I yearned for; that is, my own scriptural heritage. I can definitely satisfy his mind with my answer.” </p>
<p id="dn4:13.1">Then Soṇadaṇḍa straightened his back, looked around the assembly, and said to the Buddha, “Master Gotama, a brahmin must possess five factors for the brahmins to describe him as a brahmin; and so that when he says ‘I am a brahmin’ he speaks rightly, without falling into falsehood. What five? It’s when a brahmin is well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation. He recites and remembers the hymns, and has mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knows philology and grammar, and is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. He is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He is magnificent, splendid, remarkable to behold. He is ethical, mature in ethical conduct. He’s astute and clever, being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle. These are the five factors which a brahmin must possess for the brahmins to describe him as a brahmin; and so that when he says ‘I am a brahmin’ he speaks rightly, without falling into falsehood.” </p>
<p id="dn4:14.1">“But brahmin, is it possible to set aside one of these five factors and still rightly describe someone as a brahmin?” </p>
<p id="dn4:14.3">“It is possible, Master Gotama. We could leave appearance out of the five factors. For what does appearance matter? A brahmin must possess the remaining four factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a brahmin.” </p>
<p id="dn4:15.1">“But brahmin, is it possible to set aside one of these four factors and still rightly describe someone as a brahmin?” </p>
<p id="dn4:15.3">“It is possible, Master Gotama. We could leave the hymns out of the five factors. For what do the hymns matter? A brahmin must possess the remaining three factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a brahmin.” </p>
<p id="dn4:16.1">“But brahmin, is it possible to set aside one of these three factors and still rightly describe someone as a brahmin?” </p>
<p id="dn4:16.3">“It is possible, Master Gotama. We could leave birth out of the five factors. For what does birth matter? It’s when a brahmin is ethical, mature in ethical conduct; and he’s astute and clever, being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle. A brahmin must possess these two factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a brahmin.” </p>
<p id="dn4:17.1">When he had spoken, those brahmins said to him, “Please don’t say that, Master Soṇadaṇḍa, please don’t say that! You’re just condemning appearance, the hymns, and birth! You’re totally going over to the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine!” </p>
<p id="dn4:18.1">So the Buddha said to them, “Well, brahmins, if you think that Soṇadaṇḍa is unlearned, a poor speaker, witless, and not capable of having a dialogue with me about this, then leave him aside and you can have a dialogue with me. But if you think that he’s learned, a good speaker, astute, and capable of having a dialogue with me about this, then you should stand aside and let him have a dialogue with me.” </p>
<p id="dn4:19.1">When he said this, Soṇadaṇḍa said to the Buddha, “Let it be, Master Gotama, be silent. I myself will respond to them in a legitimate manner.” Then he said to those brahmins, “Don’t say this, gentlemen, don’t say this: ‘You’re just condemning appearance, the hymns, and birth! You’re totally going over to the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine!’ I’m not condemning appearance, hymns, or birth.” </p>
<p id="dn4:20.1">Now at that time Soṇadaṇḍa’s nephew, the student Aṅgaka was sitting in that assembly. Then Soṇadaṇḍa said to those brahmins, “Gentlemen, do you see my nephew, the student Aṅgaka?” </p>
<p id="dn4:20.4">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn4:20.5">“Aṅgaka is attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He is magnificent, splendid, remarkable to behold. There’s no-one in this assembly so good-looking, apart from the ascetic Gotama. Aṅgaka recites and remembers the hymns, and has mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knows philology and grammar, and is well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. And I am the one who teaches him the hymns. Aṅgaka is well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation. And I know his mother and father. But if Aṅgaka were to kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie, and drink alcohol, then what’s the use of his appearance, his hymns, or his birth? It’s when a brahmin is ethical, mature in ethical conduct; and he’s astute and clever, being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle. A brahmin must possess these two factors for the brahmins to rightly describe him as a brahmin.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">6. The Discussion of Ethics and Wisdom </h3>
<p id="dn4:21.1">“But brahmin, is it possible to set aside one of these two factors and still rightly describe someone as a brahmin?” </p>
<p id="dn4:21.3">“No, Master Gotama. For wisdom is cleansed by ethics, and ethics are cleansed by wisdom. Ethics and wisdom always go together. An ethical person is wise, and a wise person ethical. And ethics and wisdom are said to be the best things in the world. It’s just like when you clean one hand with the other, or clean one foot with the other. In the same way, wisdom is cleansed by ethics, and ethics are cleansed by wisdom. Ethics and wisdom always go together. An ethical person is wise, and a wise person ethical. And ethics and wisdom are said to be the best things in the world.” </p>
<p id="dn4:22.1">“That’s so true, brahmin, that’s so true! For wisdom is cleansed by ethics, and ethics are cleansed by wisdom. Ethics and wisdom always go together. An ethical person is wise, and a wise person ethical. And ethics and wisdom are said to be the best things in the world. It’s just like when you clean one hand with the other, or clean one foot with the other. In the same way, wisdom is cleansed by ethics, and ethics are cleansed by wisdom. Ethics and wisdom always go together. An ethical person is wise, and a wise person ethical. And ethics and wisdom are said to be the best things in the world. </p>
<p id="dn4:22.10">But what, brahmin, is that ethical conduct? And what is that wisdom?” </p>
<p id="dn4:22.12">“That’s all I know about this matter, Master Gotama. May Master Gotama himself please clarify the meaning of this.” </p>
<p id="dn4:23.1">“Well then, brahmin, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="dn4:23.2">“Yes sir,” Soṇadaṇḍa replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="dn4:23.4">“It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. This, brahmin, is that ethical conduct. … They enter and remain in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption … They extend and project the mind toward knowledge and vision … This pertains to their wisdom. … They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ This pertains to their wisdom. This, brahmin, is that wisdom.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">7. Soṇadaṇḍa Declares Himself a Lay Follower </h3>
<p id="dn4:24.1">When he had spoken, Soṇadaṇḍa said to the Buddha, “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. Would you and the Order of monks please accept a meal from me tomorrow?” The Buddha consented in silence. </p>
<p id="dn4:24.8">Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Soṇadaṇḍa got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. And when the night had passed Soṇadaṇḍa had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, “It’s time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.” Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of Soṇadaṇḍa together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Soṇadaṇḍa served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods. </p>
<p id="dn4:26.1">When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Soṇadaṇḍa took a low seat and sat to one side. Seated to one side he said to the Buddha: “Master Gotama, if, when I have gone to an assembly, I rise from my seat and bow to the Buddha, that assembly might disparage me for that. And when you’re disparaged by the assembly, your reputation diminishes. When your reputation diminishes, your wealth also diminishes. But my wealth relies on my reputation. If, when I have gone to an assembly, I raise my joined palms, please take it that I have risen from my seat. And if I undo my turban, please take it that I have bowed. And Master Gotama, if, when I am in a carriage, I rise from my seat and bow to the Buddha, that assembly might disparage me for that. If, when I am in a carriage, I hold up my goad, please take it that I have got down from my carriage. And if I lower my sunshade, please take it that I have bowed.” </p>
<p id="dn4:27.1">Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired the brahmin Soṇadaṇḍa with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. </p>

<h2 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">DN 5</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">With Kūṭadanta </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Kūṭadantasutta</span></h2>
<h3 class="subheading">1. The Brahmins and Householders of Khāṇumata </h3>
<p id="dn5:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Magadhans together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Magadhan brahmins named Khāṇumata. There he stayed nearby at Ambalaṭṭhikā. </p>
<p id="dn5:1.4">Now at that time the brahmin Kūṭadanta was living in Khāṇumata. It was a crown property given by King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal endowment of the highest quality. Now at that time Kūṭadanta had prepared a great sacrifice. Bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats and rams—seven hundred of each—had been led to the post for the sacrifice. </p>
<p id="dn5:2.1">The brahmins and householders of Khāṇumataka heard: </p>
<p id="dn5:2.2">“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Khāṇumataka and is staying in a forest nearby. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.” </p>
<p id="dn5:2.8">Then, having departed Khāṇumataka, they formed into companies and headed to Ambalaṭṭhikā. </p>
<p id="dn5:3.1">Now at that time the brahmin Kūṭadanta had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap. He saw the brahmins and householders heading for Ambalaṭṭhikā, and addressed his steward, “My steward, why are the brahmins and householders headed for Ambalaṭṭhikā?” </p>
<p id="dn5:3.5">“The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Khāṇumataka and is staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ They’re going to see that Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn5:4.1">Then Kūṭadanta thought, “I’ve heard that the ascetic Gotama knows how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories. I don’t know about that, but I wish to perform a great sacrifice. Why don’t I ask him how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories?” </p>
<p id="dn5:4.7">Then Kūṭadanta addressed his steward, “Well then, go to the brahmins and householders and say to them: ‘Sirs, the brahmin Kūṭadanta asks you to wait, as he will also go to see the ascetic Gotama.’” </p>
<p id="dn5:4.11">“Yes, sir,” replied the steward, and did as he was asked. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. The Qualities of Kūṭadanta </h3>
<p id="dn5:5.1">Now at that time several hundred brahmins were residing in Khāṇumata thinking to participate in Kūṭadanta’s sacrifice. They heard that Kūṭadanta was going to see the ascetic Gotama. They approached Kūṭadanta and said to him: </p>
<p id="dn5:5.6">“Is it really true that you are going to see the ascetic Gotama?” </p>
<p id="dn5:5.7">“Yes, gentlemen, it is true.” </p>
<p id="dn5:6.1">“Please don’t! It’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama. For if you do so, your reputation will diminish and his will increase. For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama; it’s appropriate that he comes to see you. </p>
<p id="dn5:6.6">You are well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation. For this reason it’s not appropriate for you to go to see the ascetic Gotama; it’s appropriate that he comes to see you. </p>
<p id="dn5:6.9">You’re rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain … </p>
<p id="dn5:6.10">You recite and remember the hymns, and have mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. You know philology and grammar, and are well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. … </p>

<h3 class="subheading">3. The Qualities of the Buddha </h3>
<p id="dn5:7.1">When they had spoken, Kūṭadanta said to those brahmins: </p>

<p id="dn5:7.28">He leads an order and a community, and teaches a community, and is said to be the best of the various religious founders. He didn’t come by his fame in the same ways as those other ascetics and brahmins. Rather, he came by his fame due to his supreme knowledge and conduct. … </p>
<p id="dn5:7.30">King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. … </p>
<p id="dn5:7.31">King Pasenadi of Kosala and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. … </p>
<p id="dn5:7.32">The brahmin Pokkharasāti and his wives and children have gone for refuge for life to the ascetic Gotama. … </p>
<p id="dn5:7.33">He’s honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by King Bimbisāra of Magadha … </p>
<p id="dn5:7.34">King Pasenadi of Kosala … </p>
<p id="dn5:7.35">and the brahmin Pokkharasāti. </p>
<p id="dn5:7.36">The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Khāṇumata and is staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā. Any ascetic or brahmin who comes to stay in our village district is our guest, and should be honored and respected as such. For this reason, too, it’s not appropriate for Master Gotama to come to see me, rather, it’s appropriate for me to go to see him. This is the extent of Master Gotama’s praise that I have learned. But his praises are not confined to this, for the praise of Master Gotama is limitless.” </p>
<p id="dn5:7.45">When he had spoken, those brahmins said to him, “According to Kūṭadanta’s praises, if Master Gotama were staying within a hundred leagues, it’d be worthwhile for a faithful gentleman to go to see him, even if he had to carry his own provisions in a shoulder bag.” </p>
<p id="dn5:7.47">“Well then, gentlemen, let’s all go to see the ascetic Gotama.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">4. The Story of King Mahāvijita’s Sacrifice </h3>
<p id="dn5:8.1">Then Kūṭadanta together with a large group of brahmins went to see the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Before sitting down to one side, some of the brahmins and householders of Khāṇumataka bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. </p>
<p id="dn5:9.1">Kūṭadanta said to the Buddha, “Master Gotama, I’ve heard that you know how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories. I don’t know about that, but I wish to perform a great sacrifice. Please teach me how to accomplish the sacrifice with three modes and sixteen accessories.” </p>
<p id="dn5:9.7">“Well then, brahmin, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="dn5:9.8">“Yes sir,” Kūṭadanta replied. The Buddha said this: Once upon a time, brahmin, there was a king named Mahāvijita. He was rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, lots of money and grain, and a full treasury and storehouses. Then as King Mahāvijita was in private retreat this thought came to his mind: ‘I have achieved human wealth, and reign after conquering this vast territory. Why don’t I hold a large sacrifice? That will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’ </p>
<p id="dn5:10.4">Then he summoned the brahmin high priest and said to him: ‘Just now, brahmin, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind, “I have achieved human wealth, and reign after conquering this vast territory. Why don’t I perform a great sacrifice? That will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.” Brahmin, I wish to perform a great sacrifice. Please instruct me. It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’ </p>
<p id="dn5:11.1">When he had spoken, the brahmin high priest said to him: ‘Sir, the king’s realm is harried and oppressed. Bandits have been seen raiding villages, towns, and cities, and infesting the highways. But if the king were to extract more taxes while his realm is thus harried and oppressed, he would not be doing his duty. </p>
<p id="dn5:11.4">Now the king might think, “I’ll eradicate this outlaw threat by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment!” But that’s not the right way to eradicate this barbarian obstacle. Those who remain after the killing will return to harass the king’s realm. </p>
<p id="dn5:11.7">Rather, here is a plan, relying on which the outlaw threat will be properly uprooted. So let the king provide seed and fodder for those in the realm who work in farming and raising cattle. Let the king provide funding for those who work in trade. Let the king guarantee food and wages for those in government service. Then the people, occupied with their own work, will not harass the realm. The king’s revenues will be great. When the country is secured as a sanctuary, free of being harried and oppressed, the happy people, with joy in their hearts, dancing with children at their breast, will dwell as if their houses were wide open.’ </p>
<p id="dn5:11.14">The king agreed with the high priest’s advice and followed his recommendation. </p>
<p id="dn5:11.19">Then the king summoned the brahmin high priest and said to him: ‘I have eradicated the outlaw threat. And relying on your plan my revenue is now great. Since the country is secured as a sanctuary, free of being harried and oppressed, the happy people, with joy in their hearts, dancing with children at their breast, dwell as if their houses were wide open. Brahmin, I wish to perform a great sacrifice. Please instruct me. It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’ </p>
<h4 class="subheading">4.1. The Four Accessories </h4>
<p id="dn5:12.1">‘In that case, let the king announce this throughout the realm to the aristocrat vassals, ministers and counselors, well-to-do brahmins, and well-off householders, both of town and country: “I wish to perform a great sacrifice. Please grant your approval, gentlemen; it will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.” </p>
<p id="dn5:12.3">The king agreed with the high priest’s advice and followed his recommendation. And all of the people who were thus informed responded by saying: ‘May the king perform a sacrifice! It is time for a sacrifice, great king.’ And so these four consenting factions became accessories to the sacrifice. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">4.2. The Eight Accessories </h4>
<p id="dn5:13.1">King Mahāvijita possessed eight factors. </p>
<p id="dn5:13.2">He was well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation. </p>
<p id="dn5:13.3">He was attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. He was magnificent, splendid, remarkable to behold. </p>
<p id="dn5:13.4">He was rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, lots of money and grain, and a full treasury and storehouses. </p>
<p id="dn5:13.5">He was powerful, having an army of four divisions that was obedient and carried out instructions. He’d probably prevail over his enemies just with his reputation. </p>
<p id="dn5:13.6">He was faithful, generous, a donor, his door always open. He was a well-spring of support, making merit with ascetics and brahmins, for paupers, vagrants, nomads, and beggars. </p>
<p id="dn5:13.7">He was very learned in diverse fields of learning. He understood the meaning of diverse statements, saying: ‘This is what that statement means; that is what this statement means.’ </p>
<p id="dn5:13.9">He was astute, competent, and intelligent, able to think issues through as they bear upon the past, future, and present. </p>
<p id="dn5:13.10">These are the eight factors that King Mahāvijita possessed. And so these eight factors also became accessories to the sacrifice. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">4.3. Four More Accessories </h4>
<p id="dn5:14.1">And the brahmin high priest had four factors. </p>
<p id="dn5:14.2">He was well born on both his mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation. </p>
<p id="dn5:14.3">He recited and remembered the hymns, and had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knew philology and grammar, and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. </p>
<p id="dn5:14.4">He was ethical, mature in ethical conduct. </p>
<p id="dn5:14.5">He was astute and clever, being the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle. </p>
<p id="dn5:14.6">These are the four factors that the brahmin high priest possessed. And so these four factors also became accessories to the sacrifice. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">4.4. The Three Modes </h4>
<p id="dn5:15.1">Next, before the sacrifice, the brahmin high priest taught the three modes to the king. ‘Now, though the king wants to perform a great sacrifice, he might have certain regrets, thinking: “I shall lose a great fortune,” or “I am losing a great fortune,” or “I have lost a great fortune.” But the king should not harbor such regrets.’ </p>
<p id="dn5:15.8">These are the three modes that the brahmin high priest taught to the king before the sacrifice. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">4.5. The Ten Respects </h4>
<p id="dn5:16.1">Next, before the sacrifice, the brahmin high priest dispelled the king’s regret regarding the recipients in ten respects: </p>
<p id="dn5:16.2">‘There will come to the sacrifice those who kill living creatures and those who refrain from killing living creatures. As to those who kill living creatures, the outcome of that is theirs alone. But as to those who refrain from killing living creatures, it is for their sakes that the king should sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his heart. </p>
<p id="dn5:16.5">There will come to the sacrifice those who steal … commit sexual misconduct … lie … use divisive speech … use harsh speech … talk nonsense … are covetous … have ill will … have wrong view and those who have right view. As to those who have wrong view, the outcome of that is theirs alone. But as to those who have right view, it is for their sakes that the king should sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his heart.’ </p>
<p id="dn5:16.16">These are the ten respects in which the high priest dispelled the king’s regret regarding the recipients before the sacrifice. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">4.6. The Sixteen Respects </h4>
<p id="dn5:17.1">Next, while the king was performing the great sacrifice, the brahmin high priest educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired the king’s mind in sixteen respects: </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="dn5:17.2">‘Now, while the king is performing the great sacrifice, someone might say, “King Mahāvijita performs a great sacrifice, but he did not announce it to the aristocrat vassals of town and country. That’s the kind of great sacrifice that this king performs.” Those who speak against the king in this way have no legitimacy. For the king did indeed announce it to the aristocrat vassals of town and country. Let the king know this as a reason to sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his heart. </p>
<p data-counter="2–4" id="dn5:17.8">While the king is performing the great sacrifice, someone might say, “King Mahāvijita performs a great sacrifice, but he did not announce it to the ministers and counselors, well-to-do brahmins, and well-off householders, both of town and country. That’s the kind of great sacrifice that this king performs.” Those who speak against the king in this way have no legitimacy. For the king did indeed announce it to all these people. Let the king know this too as a reason to sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his heart. </p>
<p data-counter="5–12" id="dn5:17.13">While the king is performing the great sacrifice, someone might say that he does not possess the eight factors. Those who speak against the king in this way have no legitimacy. For the king does indeed possess the eight factors. Let the king know this too as a reason to sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his heart. </p>
<p data-counter="13" id="dn5:17.30">While the king is performing the great sacrifice, someone might say that the high priest does not possess the four factors. Those who speak against the king in this way have no legitimacy. For the high priest does indeed possess the four factors. Let the king know this too as a reason to sacrifice, relinquish, rejoice, and gain confidence in his heart.’ </p>
<p data-counter="14–16" id="dn5:17.45">These are the sixteen respects in which the high priest educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired the king’s mind while he was performing the sacrifice. </p>
<p id="dn5:18.1">And brahmin, in that sacrifice no cattle were killed, no goats were killed, and no chickens or pigs were killed. There was no slaughter of various kinds of creatures. No trees were felled for the sacrificial post. No grass was reaped to strew over the place of sacrifice. No bondservants, employees, or workers did their jobs under threat of punishment and danger, weeping with tearful faces. Those who wished to work did so, while those who did not wish to did not. They did the work they wanted to, and did not do what they didn’t want to. The sacrifice was completed with just ghee, oil, butter, curds, honey, and molasses. </p>
<p id="dn5:19.1">Then the aristocrat vassals, ministers and counselors, well-to-do brahmins, and well-off householders of both town and country came to the king bringing abundant wealth and said, ‘Sire, this abundant wealth is specially for you alone; may Your Highness accept it!’ </p>
<p id="dn5:19.3">‘There’s enough raised for me through regular taxes. Let this be for you; and here, take even more!’ </p>
<p id="dn5:19.5">When the king turned them down, they withdrew to one side to think up a plan, ‘It wouldn’t be proper for us to take this abundant wealth back to our own homes. King Mahāvijita is performing a great sacrifice. Let us make an offering as an auxiliary sacrifice.’ </p>
<p id="dn5:20.1">Then the aristocrat vassals of town and country set up gifts to the east of the sacrificial pit. The ministers and counselors of town and country set up gifts to the south of the sacrificial pit. The well-to-do brahmins of town and country set up gifts to the west of the sacrificial pit. The well-off householders of town and country set up gifts to the north of the sacrificial pit. </p>
<p id="dn5:20.5">And brahmin, in that sacrifice too no cattle were killed, no goats were killed, and no chickens or pigs were killed. There was no slaughter of various kinds of creatures. No trees were felled for the sacrificial post. No grass was reaped to strew over the place of sacrifice. No bondservants, employees, or workers did their jobs under threat of punishment and danger, weeping with tearful faces. Those who wished to work did so, while those who did not wish to did not. They did the work they wanted to, and did not do what they didn’t want to. The sacrifice was completed with just ghee, oil, butter, curds, honey, and molasses. </p>
<p id="dn5:20.10">And so there were four consenting factions, eight factors possessed by King Mahāvijita, four factors possessed by the high priest, and three modes. Brahmin, this is called the sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories.” </p>
<p id="dn5:21.1">When he said this, those brahmins made an uproar, “Hooray for such sacrifice! Hooray for the accomplishment of such sacrifice!” </p>
<p id="dn5:21.3">But the brahmin Kūṭadanta sat in silence. So those brahmins said to him, “How can you not applaud the ascetic Gotama’s fine words?” </p>
<p id="dn5:21.6">“It’s not that I don’t applaud what he said. If anyone didn’t applaud such fine words, their head would explode! </p>
<p id="dn5:21.8">But, gentlemen, it occurs to me that the ascetic Gotama does not say: ‘So I have heard’ or ‘It ought to be like this.’ Rather, he just says: ‘So it was then, this is how it was then.’ </p>
<p id="dn5:21.13">It occurs to me that the ascetic Gotama at that time must have been King Mahāvijita, the owner of the sacrifice, or else the brahmin high priest who facilitated the sacrifice for him. </p>
<p id="dn5:21.15">Does Master Gotama recall having performed such a sacrifice, or having facilitated it, and then, when his body broke up, after death, being reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm?” </p>
<p id="dn5:21.16">“I do recall that, brahmin. For at that time I was the brahmin high priest who facilitated the sacrifice.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">5. A Regular Gift as an Ongoing Family Sacrifice. </h3>
<p id="dn5:22.1">“But Master Gotama, apart from that sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories, is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?” </p>
<p id="dn5:22.2">“There is, brahmin.” </p>
<p id="dn5:22.3">“But what is it?” </p>
<p id="dn5:22.4">“The regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice given specially to ethical renunciates; this sacrifice, brahmin, has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial.” </p>
<p id="dn5:23.1">“What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why those regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice have fewer requirements and undertakings, yet are more fruitful and beneficial, compared with the sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories?” </p>
<p id="dn5:23.2">“Because neither perfected ones nor those who are on the path to perfection will attend such a sacrifice. Why is that? Because beatings and throttlings are seen there. </p>
<p id="dn5:23.5">But the regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice given specially to ethical renunciates; perfected ones and those who are on the path to perfection will attend such a sacrifice. Why is that? Because no beatings and throttlings are seen there. </p>
<p id="dn5:23.9">This is the cause, brahmin, this is the reason why those regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice have fewer requirements and undertakings, yet are more fruitful and beneficial, compared with the sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories.” </p>
<p id="dn5:24.1">“But Master Gotama, apart from that sacrifice accomplished with three modes and sixteen accessories and those regular gifts as ongoing family sacrifice, is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?” </p>
<p id="dn5:24.2">“There is, brahmin.” </p>
<p id="dn5:24.3">“But what is it?” </p>
<p id="dn5:24.4">“When someone gives a dwelling specially for the Saṅgha of the four quarters.” </p>
<p id="dn5:25.1">“But is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?” </p>
<p id="dn5:25.4">“When someone with confident heart goes for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha.” </p>
<p id="dn5:26.1">“But is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?” </p>
<p id="dn5:26.4">“When someone with a confident heart undertakes the training rules to refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and alcoholic drinks that cause negligence.” </p>
<p id="dn5:27.1">“But is there any other sacrifice that has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?” </p>
<p id="dn5:27.2">“There is, brahmin. </p>
<p id="dn5:27.4">It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. … They enter and remain in the first absorption … This sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former, yet is more fruitful and beneficial. … </p>
<p id="dn5:27.8">They enter and remain in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. This sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former, yet is more fruitful and beneficial. … </p>
<p id="dn5:27.12">They extend and project the mind toward knowledge and vision … This sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former, yet is more fruitful and beneficial. </p>
<p id="dn5:27.14">They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ This sacrifice has fewer requirements and undertakings than the former, yet is more fruitful and beneficial. And, brahmin, there is no other accomplishment of sacrifice which is better and finer than this.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">6. Kūṭadanta Declares Himself a Lay Follower </h3>
<p id="dn5:28.1">When he had spoken, Kūṭadanta said to the Buddha, “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. </p>
<p id="dn5:28.6">And these bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, and rams—seven hundred of each—I release them, I grant them life! Let them eat green grass and drink cool water, and may a cool breeze blow upon them!” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">7. The Realization of the Fruit of Stream-Entry </h3>
<p id="dn5:29.1">Then the Buddha taught Kūṭadanta step by step, with a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation. And when he knew that Kūṭadanta’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the brahmin Kūṭadanta: “Everything that has a beginning has an end.” </p>
<p id="dn5:30.1">Then Kūṭadanta saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha, “Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?” The Buddha consented in silence. </p>
<p id="dn5:30.4">Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Kūṭadanta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. And when the night had passed Kūṭadanta had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, “It’s time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.” </p>
<p id="dn5:30.7">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of Kūṭadanta together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out. </p>
<p id="dn5:30.8">Then Kūṭadanta served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods. When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Kūṭadanta took a low seat and sat to one side. Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. </p>

<h3 class="subheading">1. On the Brahmin Emissaries </h3>
<p id="dn6:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Now at that time several brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha were residing in Vesālī on some business. They heard: </p>
<p id="dn6:1.5">“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.” </p>
<p id="dn6:2.1">Then they went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood to see the Buddha. </p>
<p id="dn6:2.2">Now, at that time Venerable Nāgita was the Buddha’s attendant. The brahmin emissaries went up to him and said, “Master Nāgita, where is Master Gotama at present? For we want to see him.” </p>
<p id="dn6:2.6">“It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha; he is on retreat.” </p>
<p id="dn6:2.7">So right there the brahmin emissaries sat down to one side, thinking, “We’ll go only after we’ve seen Master Gotama.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. On Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi </h3>
<p id="dn6:3.1">Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis also approached Nāgita at the hall with the peaked roof. He bowed, stood to one side, and said to Nāgita, “Master Nāgita, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha? For we want to see him.” </p>
<p id="dn6:3.4">“It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha; he is on retreat.” </p>
<p id="dn6:3.5">So right there Oṭṭhaddha also sat down to one side, thinking, “I’ll go only after I’ve seen the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.” </p>
<p id="dn6:4.1">Then the novice Sīha approached Nāgita. He bowed, stood to one side, and said to Nāgita, “Sir, Kassapa, these several brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha, and also Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis, have come here to see the Buddha. It’d be good if these people got to see the Buddha.” </p>
<p id="dn6:4.3">“Well then, Sīha, tell the Buddha yourself.” </p>
<p id="dn6:4.4">“Yes, sir,” replied Sīha. He went to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and told him of the people waiting to see him, adding: “Sir, it’d be good if these people got to see the Buddha.” </p>
<p id="dn6:4.7">“Well then, Sīha, spread out a seat in the shade of the dwelling.” </p>
<p id="dn6:4.8">“Yes, sir,” replied Sīha, and he did so. </p>
<p id="dn6:4.9">Then the Buddha came out of his dwelling and sat in the shade of the dwelling on the seat spread out. Then the brahmin emissaries went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. </p>
<p id="dn6:5.3">Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi together with a large assembly of Licchavis also went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Oṭṭhaddha said to the Buddha, “Sir, a few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me and said: ‘Mahāli, soon I will have been living in dependence on the Buddha for three years. I see heavenly sights that are pleasant, sensual, and arousing, but I don’t hear heavenly sounds that are pleasant, sensual, and arousing.’ The heavenly sounds that Sunakkhatta cannot hear: do such sounds really exist or not?” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.1. One-Sided Immersion </h4>
<p id="dn6:5.7">“Such sounds really do exist, but Sunakkhatta cannot hear them.” </p>
<p id="dn6:6.1">“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why Sunakkhatta cannot hear them, even though they really do exist?” </p>
<p id="dn6:6.2">“Mahāli, take a mendicant who has developed one-sided immersion to the eastern quarter so as to see heavenly sights but not to hear heavenly sounds. When they have developed immersion for that purpose, they see heavenly sights but don’t hear heavenly sounds. Why is that? Because that is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way. </p>
<p id="dn6:7.1">Furthermore, take a mendicant who has developed one-sided immersion to the southern quarter … western quarter … northern quarter … above, below, across … That is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way. </p>
<p id="dn6:8.1">Take a mendicant who has developed one-sided immersion to the eastern quarter so as to hear heavenly sounds but not to see heavenly sights. When they have developed immersion for that purpose, they hear heavenly sounds but don’t see heavenly sights. Why is that? Because that is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way. </p>
<p id="dn6:9.1">Furthermore, take a mendicant who has developed one-sided immersion to the southern quarter … western quarter … northern quarter … above, below, across … That is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way. </p>
<p id="dn6:10.1">Take a mendicant who has developed two-sided immersion to the eastern quarter so as to both hear heavenly sounds and see heavenly sights. When they have developed immersion for that purpose, they both see heavenly sights and hear heavenly sounds. Why is that? Because that is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way. </p>
<p id="dn6:11.1">Furthermore, take a mendicant who has developed two-sided immersion to the southern quarter … western quarter … northern quarter … above, below, across … That is how it is for a mendicant who develops immersion in that way. This is the cause, Mahāli, this is the reason why Sunakkhatta cannot hear heavenly sounds that are pleasant, sensual, and arousing, even though they really do exist.” </p>
<p id="dn6:12.1">“Surely the mendicants must lead the spiritual life under the Buddha for the sake of realizing such a development of immersion?” </p>
<p id="dn6:12.2">“No, Mahāli, the mendicants don’t lead the spiritual life under me for the sake of realizing such a development of immersion. There are other things that are finer, for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.2. The Four Noble Fruits </h4>
<p id="dn6:13.1">“But sir, what are those finer things?” </p>
<p id="dn6:13.2">“Firstly, Mahāli, with the ending of three fetters a mendicant is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. This is one of the finer things for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me. </p>
<p id="dn6:13.4">Furthermore, a mendicant—with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion—is a once-returner. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. This too is one of the finer things. </p>
<p id="dn6:13.6">Furthermore, with the ending of the five lower fetters, a mendicant is reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. This too is one of the finer things. </p>
<p id="dn6:13.8">Furthermore, a mendicant has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. This too is one of the finer things. </p>
<p id="dn6:13.10">These are the finer things, for the sake of which the mendicants lead the spiritual life under me.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.3. The Noble Eightfold Path </h4>
<p id="dn6:14.1">“But, sir, is there a path and a practice for realizing these things?” </p>
<p id="dn6:14.2">“There is, Mahāli.” </p>
<p id="dn6:14.3">“Well, what is it?” </p>
<p id="dn6:14.4">“It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. This is the path and the practice for realizing these things. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.4. On the Two Renunciates </h4>
<p id="dn6:15.1">This one time, Mahāli, I was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. Then two renunciates—the wanderer Muṇḍiya and Jāliya the pupil of Dārupattika—came and exchanged greetings with me. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they stood to one side and said to me: ‘Reverend Gotama, are the soul and the body the same thing, or they are different things?’ </p>
<p id="dn6:16.1">‘Well then, reverends, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.’ </p>
<p id="dn6:16.2">‘Yes, reverend,’ they replied. </p>
<p id="dn6:16.3">I said this: ‘Take the case when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. … </p>
<p id="dn6:16.6">They enter and remain in the first absorption. When a mendicant knows and sees like this, would it be appropriate to say of them: “The soul and the body are the same thing” or “The soul and the body are different things”?’ </p>
<p id="dn6:16.10">‘It would, reverend.’ </p>
<p id="dn6:16.12">‘But reverends, I know and see like this. Nevertheless, I do not say: “The soul and the body are the same thing” or “The soul and the body are different things”. … </p>
<p id="dn6:17.1">They enter and remain in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. When a mendicant knows and sees like this, would it be appropriate to say of them: “The soul and the body are the same thing” or “The soul and the body are different things”?’ </p>
<p id="dn6:17.6">‘It would, reverend.’ </p>
<p id="dn6:17.8">‘But reverends, I know and see like this. Nevertheless, I do not say: “The soul and the body are the same thing” or “The soul and the body are different things”. … </p>
<p id="dn6:18.1">They extend and project the mind toward knowledge and vision … When a mendicant knows and sees like this, would it be appropriate to say of them: “The soul and the body are the same thing” or “The soul and the body are different things”?’ </p>
<p id="dn6:18.5">‘It would, reverend.’ </p>
<p id="dn6:18.7">‘But reverends, I know and see like this. Nevertheless, I do not say: “The soul and the body are the same thing” or “The soul and the body are different things”. … </p>
<p id="dn6:19.1">They understand: “… there is no return to any state of existence.” When a mendicant knows and sees like this, would it be appropriate to say of them: “The soul and the body are the same thing” or “The soul and the body are different things”?’ </p>
<p id="dn6:19.4">‘It would not, reverend.’ </p>
<p id="dn6:19.6">‘But reverends, I know and see like this. Nevertheless, I do not say: “The soul and the body are the same thing” or “The soul and the body are different things”.’” </p>
<p id="dn6:19.9">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, Oṭṭhaddha the Licchavi was happy with what the Buddha said. </p>

<p id="dn8:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Ujuñña, in the deer park at Kaṇṇakatthala. </p>
<p id="dn8:1.3">Then the naked ascetic Kassapa went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side, and said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="dn8:2.1">“Master Gotama, I have heard the following: ‘The ascetic Gotama criticizes all forms of mortification. He categorically condemns and denounces those self-mortifiers who live rough.’ Do those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism? For we don’t want to misrepresent Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn8:3.1">“Kassapa, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They misrepresent me with what is false, baseless, and untrue. With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see some self-mortifier who lives rough reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. But I see another self-mortifier who lives rough reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. </p>
<p id="dn8:3.4">I see some self-mortifier who takes it easy reborn in a place of loss. But I see another self-mortifier who takes it easy reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. Since I truly understand the coming and going, passing away and rebirth of these self-mortifiers in this way, how could I criticize all forms of mortification, or categorically condemn and denounce those self-mortifiers who live rough? </p>
<p id="dn8:4.1">There are some clever ascetics and brahmins who are subtle, accomplished in the doctrines of others, hair-splitters. You’d think they live to demolish convictions with their intellect. They agree with me in some matters and disagree in others. Some of the things that they applaud, I also applaud. Some of the things that they don’t applaud, I also don’t applaud. But some of the things that they applaud, I don’t applaud. And some of the things that they don’t applaud, I do applaud. </p>
<p id="dn8:4.7">Some of the things that I applaud, others also applaud. Some of the things that I don’t applaud, they also don’t applaud. But some of the things that I don’t applaud, others do applaud. And some of the things that I do applaud, others don’t applaud. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">1. Examination </h3>
<p id="dn8:5.1">I go up to them and say: ‘Let us leave aside those matters on which we disagree. But there are some matters on which we agree. Regarding these, sensible people, pursuing, pressing, and grilling, would compare teacher with teacher or community with community: </p>
<p id="dn8:5.4">“There are things that are unskillful, blameworthy, not to be cultivated, unworthy of the noble ones, and dark—and are reckoned as such. Who behaves like they’ve totally given these things up: the ascetic Gotama, or the teachers of other communities?”’ </p>
<p id="dn8:6.1">It’s possible that they might say: ‘The ascetic Gotama behaves like he’s totally given those unskillful things up, compared with the teachers of other communities.’ And that’s how, when sensible people pursue the matter, they will mostly praise us. </p>
<p id="dn8:7.1">In addition, sensible people, engaging, pressing, and grilling, would compare teacher with teacher or community with community: ‘There are things that are skillful, blameless, worth cultivating, worthy of the noble ones, and bright—and are reckoned as such. Who proceeds having totally undertaken these things: the ascetic Gotama, or the teachers of other communities?’ </p>
<p id="dn8:8.1">It’s possible that they might say: ‘The ascetic Gotama proceeds having totally undertaken these things, compared with the teachers of other communities.’ And that’s how, when sensible people pursue the matter, they will mostly praise us. </p>

<h3 class="subheading">2. The Noble Eightfold Path </h3>
<p id="dn8:13.1">There is, Kassapa, a path, there is a practice, practicing in accordance with which you will know and see for yourself: ‘Only the ascetic Gotama’s words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training.’ And what is that path? It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. This is the path, this is the practice, practicing in accordance with which you will know and see for yourself: ‘Only the ascetic Gotama’s words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training.’” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">3. Practicing Self-Mortification </h3>
<p id="dn8:14.1">When he had spoken, Kassapa said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="dn8:14.2">“Reverend Gotama, those ascetics and brahmins consider these practices of self-mortification to be what makes someone a true ascetic or brahmin. They go naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on purpose for them, or an invitation for a meal. They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who has a man in her home; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or liquor or wine, and drink no beer. They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls. They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day. They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals. </p>
<p id="dn8:14.8">Those ascetics and brahmins also consider these practices of self-mortification to be what makes someone a true ascetic or brahmin. They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit. </p>
<p id="dn8:14.10">Those ascetics and brahmins also consider these practices of mortification to be what makes someone a true ascetic or brahmin. They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings. They tear out hair and beard, committed to this practice. They constantly stand, refusing seats. They squat, committed to persisting in the squatting position. They lie on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns their bed. They make their bed on a plank, or the bare ground. They lie only on one side. They wear dust and dirt. They stay in the open air. They sleep wherever they lay their mat. They eat unnatural things, committed to the practice of eating unnatural foods. They don’t drink, committed to the practice of not drinking liquids. They’re committed to the practice of immersion in water three times a day, including the evening.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">4. The Uselessness of Self-Mortification </h3>
<p id="dn8:15.1">“Kassapa, someone may practice all those forms of self-mortification, but if they haven’t developed and realized any accomplishment in ethics, mind, and wisdom, they are far from being a true ascetic or brahmin. But take a mendicant who develops a heart of love, free of enmity and ill will. And they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. When they achieve this, they’re called a mendicant who is a ‘true ascetic’ and also ‘a true brahmin’. </p>
<p id="dn8:16.1">When he had spoken, Kassapa said to the Buddha, “It’s hard, Master Gotama, to be a true ascetic or a true brahmin.” </p>
<p id="dn8:16.3">“It’s typical, Kassapa, in this world to think that it’s hard to be a true ascetic or brahmin. But someone might practice all those forms of self-mortification. And if it was only because of just that much, only because of that self-mortification that it was so very hard to be a true ascetic or brahmin, it wouldn’t be appropriate to say that it’s hard to be a true ascetic or brahmin. </p>
<p id="dn8:16.7">For it would be quite possible for a householder or a householder’s child—or even the bonded maid who carries the water-jar—to practice all those forms of self-mortification. </p>
<p id="dn8:16.9">It’s because there’s something other than just that much, something other than that self-mortification that it’s so very hard to be a true ascetic or brahmin. And that’s why it is appropriate to say that it’s hard to be a true ascetic or brahmin. Take a mendicant who develops a heart of love, free of enmity and ill will. And they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. When they achieve this, they’re called a mendicant who is a ‘true ascetic’ and also ‘a true brahmin’. </p>
<p id="dn8:17.1">When he had spoken, Kassapa said to the Buddha, “It’s hard, Master Gotama, to know a true ascetic or a true brahmin.” </p>
<p id="dn8:17.3">“It’s typical in this world to think that it’s hard to know a true ascetic or brahmin. But someone might practice all those forms of self-mortification. And if it was only by just that much, only by that self-mortification that it was so very hard to know a true ascetic or brahmin, it wouldn’t be appropriate to say that it’s hard to know a true ascetic or brahmin. </p>
<p id="dn8:17.7">For it would be quite possible for a householder or a householder’s child—or even the bonded maid who carries the water-jar—to know that someone is practicing all those forms of self-mortification. </p>
<p id="dn8:17.9">It’s because there’s something other than just that much, something other than that self-mortification that it’s so very hard to know a true ascetic or brahmin.

When they achieve this, they’re called a mendicant who is a ‘true ascetic’ and also ‘a true brahmin’.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">5. The Accomplishment of Ethics, Immersion, and Wisdom </h3>
<p id="dn8:18.1">When he had spoken, Kassapa said to the Buddha, “But Master Gotama, what is that accomplishment in ethics, in mind, and in wisdom?” </p>
<p id="dn8:18.3">“It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … Seeing danger in the slightest fault, a mendicant keeps the rules they’ve undertaken. They act skillfully by body and speech. They’re purified in livelihood and accomplished in ethical conduct. They guard the sense doors, have mindfulness and situational awareness, and are content. </p>
<p id="dn8:18.5">And how is a mendicant accomplished in ethics? It’s when a mendicant gives up killing living creatures. They renounce the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings. This pertains to their accomplishment in ethics. … </p>
<p id="dn8:19.1">There are some ascetics and brahmins who, while enjoying food given in faith, still earn a living by unworthy branches of knowledge, by wrong livelihood. … They refrain from such unworthy branches of knowledge, such wrong livelihood. This pertains to their accomplishment in ethics. </p>
<p id="dn8:19.5">A mendicant thus accomplished in ethics sees no danger in any quarter in regards to their ethical restraint. It’s like a king who has defeated his enemies. He sees no danger from his foes in any quarter. In the same way, a mendicant thus accomplished in ethics sees no danger in any quarter in regards to their ethical restraint. When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves. That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. This, Kassapa, is that accomplishment in ethics. … They enter and remain in the first absorption … This pertains to their accomplishment in mind. … They enter and remain in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. This pertains to their accomplishment in mind. This, Kassapa, is that accomplishment in mind. </p>
<p id="dn8:20.1">When their mind is immersed like this, they extend and project it toward knowledge and vision … This pertains to their accomplishment in wisdom. … They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ This pertains to their accomplishment in wisdom. This, Kassapa, is that accomplishment in wisdom. </p>
<p id="dn8:20.7">And, Kassapa, there is no accomplishment in ethics, mind, and wisdom that is better or finer than this. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">6. The Lion’s Roar </h3>
<p id="dn8:21.1">There are, Kassapa, some ascetics and brahmins who teach ethics. They praise ethical conduct in many ways. But as far as the highest noble ethics goes, I don’t see anyone who’s my equal, still less my superior. Rather, I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher ethics. </p>
<p id="dn8:21.5">There are, Kassapa, some ascetics and brahmins who teach mortification in disgust of sin. They praise mortification in disgust of sin in many ways. But as far as the highest noble mortification in disgust of sin goes, I don’t see anyone who’s my equal, still less my superior. Rather, I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher mortification in disgust of sin. </p>
<p id="dn8:21.9">There are, Kassapa, some ascetics and brahmins who teach wisdom. They praise wisdom in many ways. But as far as the highest noble wisdom goes, I don’t see anyone who’s my equal, still less my superior. Rather, I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher wisdom. </p>
<p id="dn8:21.13">There are, Kassapa, some ascetics and brahmins who teach freedom. They praise freedom in many ways. But as far as the highest noble freedom goes, I don’t see anyone who’s my equal, still less my superior. Rather, I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher freedom. </p>
<p id="dn8:22.1">It’s possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say: ‘The ascetic Gotama only roars his lion’s roar in an empty hut, not in an assembly.’ They should be told, ‘Not so!’ What should be said is this: ‘The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, and he roars it in the assemblies.’ </p>
<p id="dn8:22.5">It’s possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say: ‘The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, and he roars it in the assemblies. But he doesn’t roar it boldly.’ They should be told, ‘Not so!’ What should be said is this: ‘The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, he roars it in the assemblies, and he roars it boldly.’ </p>
<p id="dn8:22.9">It’s possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say: ‘The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, he roars it in the assemblies, and he roars it boldly. But they don’t question him. … Or he doesn’t answer their questions. … Or his answers are not satisfactory. … Or they don’t think him worth listening to. … Or they’re not confident after listening. … Or they don’t show their confidence. … Or they don’t practice accordingly. … Or they don’t succeed in their practice.’ They should be told, ‘Not so!’ What should be said is this: ‘The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar; he roars it in the assemblies; he roars it boldly; they question him; he answers their questions; his answers are satisfactory; they think him worth listening to; they’re confident after listening; they show their confidence; they practice accordingly; and they succeed in their practice.’ </p>
<h3 class="subheading">7. The Probation For One Previously Ordained </h3>
<p id="dn8:23.1">Kassapa, this one time I was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. There a certain practitioner of self-mortification named Nigrodha asked me about the higher mortification in disgust of sin. I answered his question. He was extremely happy with my answer.” </p>
<p id="dn8:23.5">“Sir, who wouldn’t be extremely happy after hearing the Buddha’s teaching? For I too am extremely happy after hearing the Buddha’s teaching! Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, so too the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” </p>
<p id="dn8:24.1">“Kassapa, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation. When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood. However, I have recognized individual differences in this matter.” </p>
<p id="dn8:24.3">“Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.” </p>
<p id="dn8:24.4">And the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. Not long after his ordination, Venerable Kassapa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="dn8:24.6">He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable Kassapa became one of the perfected. </p>

<p id="dn9:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>
<p id="dn9:1.3">Now at that time the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda was residing together with three hundred wanderers in Mallikā’s single-halled monastery for group debates, set among the flaking pale-moon ebony trees. Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. </p>
<p id="dn9:2.1">Then it occurred to him, “It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī. Why don’t I go to Mallikā’s monastery to visit the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda?” So that’s what he did. </p>
<p id="dn9:3.1">Now at that time, Poṭṭhapāda was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of unworthy talk, such as talk about kings, bandits, and ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence. </p>
<p id="dn9:4.1">Poṭṭhapāda saw the Buddha coming off in the distance, and hushed his own assembly, “Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound. Here comes the ascetic Gotama. The venerable likes quiet and praises quiet. Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.” Then those wanderers fell silent. </p>
<p id="dn9:5.1">Then the Buddha approached Poṭṭhapāda, who said to him, “Come, Blessed One! Welcome, Blessed One! It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here. Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.” </p>
<p id="dn9:5.7">The Buddha sat on the seat spread out, while Poṭṭhapāda took a low seat and sat to one side. The Buddha said to him, “Poṭṭhapāda, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.1. On the Cessation of Perception </h4>
<p id="dn9:6.1">When he said this, the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda said to the Buddha, “Sir, leave aside what we were sitting talking about just now. It won’t be hard for you to hear about that later. </p>
<p id="dn9:6.4">Sir, a few days ago several ascetics and brahmins who follow various other paths were sitting together at the debating hall, and this discussion came up among them: ‘How does the cessation of perception happen?’ </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="dn9:6.6">Some of them said: ‘A person’s perceptions arise and cease without cause or reason. When they arise, you become percipient. When they cease, you become non-percipient.’ That’s how some describe the cessation of perception. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="dn9:6.11">But someone else says: ‘That’s not how it is, gentlemen ! Perception is a person’s self, When it enters, you become percipient. When it departs, you become non-percipient.’ That’s how some describe the cessation of perception. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="dn9:6.18">But someone else says: ‘That’s not how it is, gentlemen ! There are ascetics and brahmins of great power and might. They insert and extract a person’s perception. When they insert it, you become percipient. When they extract it, you become non-percipient.’ That’s how some describe the cessation of perception. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="dn9:6.25">But someone else says: ‘That’s not how it is, gentlemen ! There are deities of great power and might. They insert and extract a person’s perception. When they insert it, you become percipient. When they extract it, you become non-percipient.’ That’s how some describe the cessation of perception. </p>
<p id="dn9:6.32">That reminded me of the Buddha: ‘Surely it must be the Blessed One, the Holy One who is so skilled in such matters.’ The Buddha is skilled and well-versed in the cessation of perception. How does the cessation of perception happen?” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.2. Perception Arises With a Cause </h4>
<p id="dn9:7.1">“Regarding this, Poṭṭhapāda, those ascetics and brahmins who say that a person’s perceptions arise and cease without cause or reason are wrong from the start. Why is that? Because a person’s perceptions arise and cease with cause and reason. With training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. </p>
<p id="dn9:7.6">And what is that training?” said the Buddha. </p>
<p id="dn9:7.7">“It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. … Seeing that the hindrances have been given up in them, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. The sensual perception that they had previously ceases. At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of seclusion. That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. And this is that training,” said the Buddha. </p>
<p id="dn9:11.1">“Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. The subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of seclusion that they had previously ceases. At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of immersion. That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. And this is that training,” said the Buddha. </p>
<p id="dn9:12.1">“Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ The subtle and true perception of the rapture and bliss born of immersion that they had previously ceases. At that time they have a subtle and true perception of equanimous bliss. That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. And this is that training,” said the Buddha. </p>
<p id="dn9:13.1">“Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. The subtle and true perception of equanimous bliss that they had previously ceases. At that time they have a subtle and true perception of neutral feeling. That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. And this is that training,” said the Buddha. </p>
<p id="dn9:14.1">“Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. The perception of luminous form that they had previously ceases. At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite space. That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. And this is that training,” said the Buddha. </p>
<p id="dn9:15.1">“Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. The subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite space that they had previously ceases. At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness. That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. And this is that training,” said the Buddha. </p>
<p id="dn9:16.1">“Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness. The subtle and true perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness that they had previously ceases. At that time they have a subtle and true perception of the dimension of nothingness. That’s how, with training, certain perceptions arise and certain perceptions cease. And this is that training,” said the Buddha. </p>
<p id="dn9:17.1">“Poṭṭhapāda, from the time a mendicant here takes responsibility for their own perception, they proceed from one stage to the next, gradually reaching the peak of perception. Standing on the peak of perception they think, ‘Intentionality is bad for me, it’s better to be free of it. For if I were to intend and choose, these perceptions would cease in me, and other coarser perceptions would arise. Why don’t I neither make a choice nor form an intention?’ They neither make a choice nor form an intention. Those perceptions cease in them, and other coarser perceptions don’t arise. They touch cessation. And that, Poṭṭhapāda, is how the gradual cessation of perception is attained with awareness. </p>
<p id="dn9:18.1">What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? Have you ever heard of this before?” </p>
<p id="dn9:18.3">“No, sir. This is how I understand what the Buddha said: ‘From the time a mendicant here takes responsibility for their own perception, they proceed from one stage to the next, gradually reaching the peak of perception. Standing on the peak of perception they think, “Intentionality is bad for me, it’s better to be free of it. For if I were to intend and choose, these perceptions would cease in me, and other coarser perceptions would arise. Why don’t I neither make a choice nor form an intention?” Those perceptions cease in them, and other coarser perceptions don’t arise. They touch cessation. And that is how the gradual cessation of perception is attained with awareness.’” </p>
<p id="dn9:18.13">“That’s right, Poṭṭhapāda.” </p>
<p id="dn9:19.1">“Does the Buddha describe just one peak of perception, or many?” </p>
<p id="dn9:19.2">“I describe the peak of perception as both one and many.” </p>
<p id="dn9:19.3">“But sir, how do you describe it as one peak and as many?” </p>
<p id="dn9:19.4">“I describe the peak of perception according to the specific manner in which one touches cessation. That’s how I describe the peak of perception as both one and many.” </p>
<p id="dn9:20.1">“But sir, does perception arise first and knowledge afterwards? Or does knowledge arise first and perception afterwards? Or do they both arise at the same time?” </p>
<p id="dn9:20.2">“Perception arises first and knowledge afterwards. The arising of perception leads to the arising of knowledge. They understand, ‘My knowledge arose from a specific condition.’ That is a way to understand how perception arises first and knowledge afterwards; that the arising of perception leads to the arising of knowledge.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.3. Perception and the Self </h4>
<p id="dn9:21.1">“Sir, is perception a person’s self, or are perception and self different things?” </p>
<p id="dn9:21.2">“But Poṭṭhapāda, do you believe in a self?” </p>
<p id="dn9:21.3">“I believe in a substantial self, sir, which has form, made up of the four primary elements, and consumes solid food.” </p>
<p id="dn9:21.4">“Suppose there were such a substantial self, Poṭṭhapāda. In that case, perception would be one thing, the self another. Here is another way to understand how perception and self are different things. So long as that substantial self remains, still some perceptions arise in a person and others cease. That is a way to understand how perception and self are different things.” </p>
<p id="dn9:22.1">“Sir, I believe in a mind-made self which is complete in all its various parts, not deficient in any faculty.” </p>
<p id="dn9:22.2">“Suppose there were such a mind-made self, Poṭṭhapāda. In that case, perception would be one thing, the self another. Here is another way to understand how perception and self are different things. So long as that mind-made self remains, still some perceptions arise in a person and others cease. That too is a way to understand how perception and self are different things.” </p>
<p id="dn9:23.1">“Sir, I believe in a formless self which is made of perception.” </p>
<p id="dn9:23.2">“Suppose there were such a formless self, Poṭṭhapāda. In that case, perception would be one thing, the self another. Here is another way to understand how perception and self are different things. So long as that formless self remains, still some perceptions arise in a person and others cease. That too is a way to understand how perception and self are different things.” </p>
<p id="dn9:24.1">“But, sir, am I able to know whether perception is a person’s self, or whether perception and self are different things?” </p>
<p id="dn9:24.3">“It’s hard for you to understand this, since you have a different view, creed, preference, practice, and tradition.” </p>
<p id="dn9:25.1">“Well, if that’s the case, sir, then is this right: ‘The cosmos is eternal. This is the only truth, anything else is wrong’?” </p>
<p id="dn9:25.4">“This has not been declared by me, Poṭṭhapāda.” </p>
<p id="dn9:26.1">“Then is this right: ‘The cosmos is not eternal. This is the only truth, anything else is wrong’?” </p>
<p id="dn9:26.2">“This too has not been declared by me.” </p>
<p id="dn9:27.1">“Then is this right: ‘The cosmos is finite …’ … ‘The cosmos is infinite …’ … ‘The soul and the body are the same thing …’ … ‘The soul and the body are different things …’ … ‘A Realized One exists after death …’ … ‘A Realized One doesn’t exist after death …’ … ‘A Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death …’ … ‘A Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death. This is the only truth, anything else is wrong’?” </p>
<p id="dn9:27.9">“This too has not been declared by me.” </p>
<p id="dn9:28.1">“Why haven’t these things been declared by the Buddha?” </p>
<p id="dn9:28.2">“Because they’re not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. That’s why I haven’t declared them.” </p>
<p id="dn9:29.1">“Then what has been declared by the Buddha?” </p>
<p id="dn9:29.2">“I have declared this: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.” </p>
<p id="dn9:30.1">“Why have these things been declared by the Buddha?” </p>
<p id="dn9:30.2">“Because they are beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. That’s why I have declared them.” </p>
<p id="dn9:30.4">“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! Please, sir, go at your convenience.” Then the Buddha got up from his seat and left. </p>
<p id="dn9:31.1">Soon after the Buddha left, those wanderers gave Poṭṭhapāda a comprehensive tongue-lashing, “No matter what the ascetic Gotama says, Poṭṭhapāda agrees with him: ‘That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One!’ We understand that the ascetic Gotama didn’t make any definitive statement at all regarding whether the cosmos is eternal and so on.” </p>
<p id="dn9:31.6">When they said this, Poṭṭhapāda said to them, “I too understand that the ascetic Gotama didn’t make any definitive statement at all regarding whether the cosmos is eternal and so on. Nevertheless, the practice that he describes is true, real, and accurate. It is the regularity of natural principles, the invariance of natural principles. So how could a sensible person such as I not agree that what was well spoken by the ascetic Gotama was in fact well spoken?” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. On Citta Hatthisāriputta </h3>
<p id="dn9:32.1">Then after two or three days had passed, Citta Hatthisāriputta and Poṭṭhapāda went to see the Buddha. Citta Hatthisāriputta bowed and sat down to one side. But the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda exchanged greetings with the Buddha, and when the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Poṭṭhapāda told the Buddha what had happened after he left. The Buddha said: </p>
<p id="dn9:33.1">“All those wanderers, Poṭṭhapāda, are blind and sightless. You are the only one who sees. For I have taught and pointed out both things that are definitive and things that are not definitive. </p>
<p id="dn9:33.5">And what things have I taught and pointed out that are not definitive? ‘The cosmos is eternal’ … ‘The cosmos is not eternal’ … ‘The cosmos is finite’ … ‘The cosmos is infinite’ … ‘The soul is the same thing as the body’ … ‘The soul and the body are different things’ … ‘A Realized One exists after death’ … ‘A Realized One doesn’t exist after death’ … ‘A Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death’ … ‘A Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death.’ </p>
<p id="dn9:33.16">And why haven’t I taught and pointed out such things that are not definitive? Because those things aren’t beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. That’s why I haven’t taught and pointed them out. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.1. Things That Are Definitive </h4>
<p id="dn9:33.20">And what things have I taught and pointed out that are definitive? ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.” </p>
<p id="dn9:33.25">And why have I taught and pointed out such things that are definitive? Because they are beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. That’s why I have taught and pointed them out. </p>
<p id="dn9:34.1">There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘The self is exclusively happy and is well after death.’ I go up to them and say, ‘Is it really true that this is the venerables’ view?’ And they answer, ‘Yes’. I say to them, ‘But do you meditate knowing and seeing an exclusively happy world?’ Asked this, they say, ‘No.’ </p>
<p id="dn9:34.10">I say to them, ‘But have you perceived an exclusively happy self for a single day or night, or even half a day or night?’ Asked this, they say, ‘No.’ </p>
<p id="dn9:34.13">I say to them, ‘But do you know a path and a practice to realize an exclusively happy world?’ Asked this, they say, ‘No.’ </p>
<p id="dn9:34.17">I say to them, ‘But have you ever heard the voice of the deities reborn in an exclusively happy world saying, “Practice well, dear sirs, practice directly so as to realize an exclusively happy world. For this is how we practiced, and we were reborn in an exclusively happy world”?’ Asked this, they say, ‘No.’ </p>
<p id="dn9:34.22">What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? This being so, doesn’t what they say turn out to have no demonstrable basis?” </p>
<p id="dn9:34.24">“Clearly that’s the case, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn9:35.1">“Suppose, Poṭṭhapāda, a man were to say: ‘Whoever the finest lady in the land is, it is her that I want, her that I desire!’ They’d say to him, ‘Mister, that finest lady in the land who you desire—do you know whether she’s an aristocrat, a brahmin, a merchant, or a worker?’ Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’ They’d say to him, ‘Mister, that finest lady in the land who you desire—do you know her name or clan? Whether she’s tall or short or medium? Whether her skin is black, brown, or tawny? What village, town, or city she comes from?’ Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’ They’d say to him, ‘Mister, do you desire someone who you’ve never even known or seen?’ Asked this, he’d say, ‘Yes.’ </p>
<p id="dn9:35.12">What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? This being so, doesn’t that man’s statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?” </p>
<p id="dn9:35.14">“Clearly that’s the case, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn9:36.1">“In the same way, the ascetics and brahmins who have those various doctrines and views … </p>
<p id="dn9:36.22">Doesn’t what they say turn out to have no demonstrable basis?” </p>
<p id="dn9:36.23">“Clearly that’s the case, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn9:37.1">“Suppose a man was to build a ladder at the crossroads for climbing up to a stilt longhouse. They’d say to him, ‘Mister, that stilt longhouse that you’re building a ladder for—do you know whether it’s to the north, south, east, or west? Or whether it’s tall or short or medium?’ Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’ They’d say to him, ‘Mister, are you building a ladder for a longhouse that you’ve never even known or seen?’ Asked this, he’d say, ‘Yes.’ </p>
<p id="dn9:37.8">What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? This being so, doesn’t that man’s statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?” </p>
<p id="dn9:37.10">“Clearly that’s the case, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn9:38.1">“In the same way, the ascetics and brahmins who have those various doctrines and views … </p>
<p id="dn9:38.21">Doesn’t what they say turn out to have no demonstrable basis?” </p>
<p id="dn9:38.22">“Clearly that’s the case, sir.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.2. Three Kinds of Reincarnation </h4>
<p id="dn9:39.1">“Poṭṭhapāda, there are these three kinds of reincarnation: a substantial reincarnation, a mind-made reincarnation, and a formless reincarnation. And what is a substantial reincarnation? It has form, made up of the four primary elements, and consumes solid food. What is a mind-made reincarnation? It has form, mind-made, complete in all its various parts, not deficient in any faculty. What is a formless reincarnation? It is formless, made of perception. </p>
<p id="dn9:40.1">I teach the Dhamma for the giving up of these three kinds of reincarnation: ‘When you practice accordingly, corrupting qualities will be given up in you and cleansing qualities will grow. You’ll enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom, having realized it with your own insight in this very life.’ Poṭṭhapāda, you might think: ‘Corrupting qualities will be given up and cleansing qualities will grow. One will enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom, having realized it with one’s own insight in this very life. But such a life is suffering.’ But you should not see it like this. Corrupting qualities will be given up and cleansing qualities will grow. One will enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom, having realized it with one’s own insight in this very life. And there will be only joy and happiness, tranquility, mindfulness and awareness. Such a life is blissful. </p>
<p id="dn9:43.1">If others should ask us, ‘But reverends, what is that substantial reincarnation?’ We’d answer like this, ‘This is that substantial reincarnation.’ </p>
<p id="dn9:44.1">If others should ask us, ‘But reverends, what is that mind-made reincarnation?’ We’d answer like this, ‘This is that mind-made reincarnation.’ </p>
<p id="dn9:45.1">If others should ask us, ‘But reverends, what is that formless reincarnation?’ We’d answer like this, ‘This is that formless reincarnation.’ </p>
<p id="dn9:45.5">What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? This being so, doesn’t that statement turn out to have a demonstrable basis?” </p>
<p id="dn9:45.7">“Clearly that’s the case, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn9:46.1">“Suppose a man were to build a ladder for climbing up to a stilt longhouse right underneath that longhouse. They’d say to him, ‘Mister, that stilt longhouse that you’re building a ladder for—do you know whether it’s to the north, south, east, or west? Or whether it’s tall or short or medium?’ He’d say, ‘This is that stilt longhouse for which I’m building a ladder, right underneath it.’ </p>
<p id="dn9:46.6">What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? This being so, doesn’t that man’s statement turn out to have a demonstrable basis?” </p>
<p id="dn9:46.8">“Clearly that’s the case, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn9:48.1">When the Buddha had spoken, Citta Hatthisāriputta said, “Sir, while in a substantial reincarnation, are the mind-made and formless reincarnations fictitious, and only the substantial reincarnation real? While in a mind-made reincarnation, are the substantial and formless reincarnations fictitious, and only the mind-made reincarnation real? While in a formless reincarnation, are the substantial and mind-made reincarnations fictitious, and only the formless reincarnation real?” </p>
<p id="dn9:49.1">“While in a substantial reincarnation, it’s not referred to as a mind-made or formless reincarnation, only as a substantial reincarnation. While in a mind-made reincarnation, it’s not referred to as a substantial or formless reincarnation, only as a mind-made reincarnation. While in a formless reincarnation, it’s not referred to as a substantial or mind-made reincarnation, only as a formless reincarnation. </p>
<p id="dn9:49.7">Citta, suppose they were to ask you, ‘Did you exist in the past? Will you exist in the future? Do you exist now?’ How would you answer?” </p>
<p id="dn9:49.12">“Sir, if they were to ask me this, I’d answer like this, ‘I existed in the past. I will exist in the future. I exist now.’ That’s how I’d answer.” </p>
<p id="dn9:50.1">“But Citta, suppose they were to ask you, ‘Is the reincarnation you had in the past your only real one, and those of the future and present fictitious? Is the reincarnation you will have in the future your only real one, and those of the past and present fictitious? Is the reincarnation you have now your only real one, and those of the past and future fictitious?’ How would you answer?” </p>
<p id="dn9:50.6">“Sir, if they were to ask me this, I’d answer like this, ‘The reincarnation I had in the past was real at that time, and those of the future and present fictitious. The reincarnation I will have in the future will be real at the time, and those of the past and present fictitious. The reincarnation I have now is real at this time, and those of the past and future fictitious.’ That’s how I’d answer.” </p>
<p id="dn9:51.1">“In the same way, while in any one of the three reincarnations, it’s not referred to as the other two, only under its own name. </p>
<p id="dn9:52.1">From a cow comes milk, from milk comes curds, from curds come butter, from butter comes ghee, and from ghee comes cream of ghee. And the cream of ghee is said to be the best of these. While it’s milk, it’s not referred to as curds, butter, ghee, or cream of ghee. It’s only referred to as milk. While it’s curd or butter or ghee or cream of ghee, it’s not referred to as anything else, only under its own name. In the same way, while in any one of the three reincarnations, it’s not referred to as the other two, only under its own name. These are the world’s usages, terms, expressions, and descriptions, which the Realized One uses without misapprehending them.” </p>
<p id="dn9:54.1">When he had spoken, the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda said to the Buddha, “Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, so too the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.3. The Ordination of Citta Hatthisāriputta </h4>
<p id="dn9:55.1">But Citta Hatthisāriputta said to the Buddha, “Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, so too the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” </p>
<p id="dn9:56.1">And Citta Hatthisāriputta received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. Not long after his ordination, Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta became one of the perfected. </p>

<h2 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">DN 10</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">With Subha </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Subhasutta</span></h2>
<p id="dn10:1.1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. It was not long after the Buddha had become fully extinguished. </p>
<p id="dn10:1.1.3">Now at that time the brahmin student Subha, Todeyya’s son, was residing in Sāvatthī on some business. Then he addressed a certain student, “Here, student, go to the ascetic Ānanda and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. And then say: ‘Sir, please visit the student Subha, Todeyya’s son, at his home out of compassion.’” </p>
<p id="dn10:1.3.2">“Yes, sir,” replied the student, and did as he was asked. </p>
<p id="dn10:1.4.1">When he had spoken, Venerable Ānanda said to him, “It’s not the right time, student. I’ve drunk sufficient refreshments for today. But hopefully tomorrow I’ll get a chance to visit him.” </p>
<p id="dn10:1.4.5">“Yes, sir,” replied the student. He went back to Subha, and told him what had happened, adding, “This much, sir, I managed to do. At least Master Ānanda will take the opportunity to visit tomorrow.” </p>
<p id="dn10:1.5.1">Then when the night had passed, Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went with Venerable Cetaka as his second monk to Subha’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Subha went up to Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda: </p>
<p id="dn10:1.5.3">“Master Ānanda, you were Master Gotama’s attendant. You were close to him, living in his presence. You ought to know what things Master Gotama praised, and in which he encouraged, settled, and grounded all these people. What were those things?” </p>
<p id="dn10:1.6.1">“Student, the Buddha praised three sets of things, and that’s what he encouraged, settled, and grounded all these people in. What three? The entire spectrum of noble ethics, immersion, and wisdom. These are the three sets of things that the Buddha praised.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">1. The Entire Spectrum of Ethics </h3>
<p id="dn10:1.6.6">“But what was that noble spectrum of ethics that the Buddha praised?” </p>
<p id="dn10:1.7.1">“Student, it’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in some clan. They gain faith in the Realized One, and reflect: ‘Living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. Once they’ve gone forth, they live restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. They act skillfully by body and speech. They’re purified in livelihood and accomplished in ethical conduct. They guard the sense doors, have mindfulness and situational awareness, and are content. </p>
<p id="dn10:1.11.1">And how is a mendicant accomplished in ethics? It’s when a mendicant gives up killing living creatures. They renounce the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings. … </p>
<p id="dn10:1.12.1-1.27">This pertains to their ethics. </p>
<p id="dn10:1.28.1">There are some ascetics and brahmins who, while enjoying food given in faith, still earn a living by unworthy branches of knowledge, by wrong livelihood. This includes rites for propitiation, for granting wishes, for ghosts, for the earth, for rain, for property settlement, and for preparing and consecrating house sites, and rites involving rinsing and bathing, and oblations. It also includes administering emetics, purgatives, expectorants, and phlegmagogues; administering ear-oils, eye restoratives, nasal medicine, ointments, and counter-ointments; surgery with needle and scalpel, treating children, prescribing root medicines, and binding on herbs. They refrain from such unworthy branches of knowledge, such wrong livelihood. … This pertains to their ethics. </p>
<p id="dn10:1.29.1">A mendicant thus accomplished in ethics sees no danger in any quarter in regards to their ethical restraint. It’s like a king who has defeated his enemies. He sees no danger from his foes in any quarter. A mendicant thus accomplished in ethics sees no danger in any quarter in regards to their ethical restraint. When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves. That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. </p>
<p id="dn10:1.30.1">This is that noble spectrum of ethics that the Buddha praised. But there is still more to be done.” </p>
<p id="dn10:1.30.3">“It’s incredible, Master Ānanda, it’s amazing, This noble spectrum of ethics is complete, not lacking anything! Such a complete spectrum of ethics cannot be seen among the other ascetics and brahmins. Were other ascetics and brahmins to see such a complete spectrum of noble ethics in themselves, they’d be delighted with just that much: ‘At this point it’s enough; at this point our work is done. We’ve reached the goal of our ascetic life. There is nothing more to be done.’ And yet you say: ‘But there is still more to be done.’ </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. The Spectrum of Immersion </h3>
<p id="dn10:2.1.1">But what, Master Ānanda, was that noble spectrum of immersion that the Buddha praised?” </p>
<p id="dn10:2.2.1">“And how, student, does a mendicant guard the sense doors? When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint. When they hear a sound with their ears … When they smell an odor with their nose … When they taste a flavor with their tongue … When they feel a touch with their body … When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint. When they have this noble sense restraint, they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves. That’s how a mendicant guards the sense doors. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.3.1">And how does a mendicant have mindfulness and situational awareness? It’s when a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent. That’s how a mendicant has mindfulness and situational awareness. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.4.1">And how is a mendicant content? It’s when a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden. In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. That’s how a mendicant is content. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.5.1">When they have this noble spectrum of ethics, this noble sense restraint, this noble mindfulness and situational awareness, and this noble contentment, they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.6.1">Giving up desire for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of desire, cleansing the mind of desire. Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will. Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness. Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse. Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.7.1">Suppose a man who has gotten into debt were to apply himself to work, and his efforts proved successful. He would pay off the original loan and have enough left over to support his partner. Thinking about this, he’d be filled with joy and happiness. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.8.1">Suppose there was a person who was sick, suffering, gravely ill. They’d lose their appetite and get physically weak. But after some time they’d recover from that illness, and regain their appetite and their strength. Thinking about this, they’d be filled with joy and happiness. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.9.1">Suppose a person was imprisoned in a jail. But after some time they were released from jail, safe and sound, with no loss of wealth. Thinking about this, they’d be filled with joy and happiness. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.10.1">Suppose a person was a bondservant. They belonged to someone else and were unable to go where they wish. But after some time they’d be freed from servitude and become their own master, an emancipated individual able to go where they wish. Thinking about this, they’d be filled with joy and happiness. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.11.1">Suppose there was a person with wealth and property who was traveling along a desert road, which was perilous, with nothing to eat. But after some time they crossed over the desert safely, arriving within a village, a sanctuary free of peril. Thinking about this, they’d be filled with joy and happiness. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.12.1">In the same way, as long as these five hindrances are not given up inside themselves, a mendicant regards them as a debt, a disease, a prison, slavery, and a desert crossing. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.12.2">But when these five hindrances are given up inside themselves, a mendicant regards this as freedom from debt, good health, release from prison, emancipation, and sanctuary. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.12.4">Seeing that the hindrances have been given up in them, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.13.1">Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.14.1">It’s like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water. They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes out. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.14.2">In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. This pertains to their immersion. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.15.1">Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.16.1">It’s like a deep lake fed by spring water. There’s no inlet to the east, west, north, or south, and no rainfall to replenish it from time to time. But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads throughout the lake. There’s no part of the lake that’s not spread through with cool water. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.16.2">In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion. This pertains to their immersion. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.17.1">Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.17.3">It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. From the tip to the root they’re drenched, steeped, filled, and soaked with cool water. There’s no part of them that’s not soaked with cool water. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.17.4">In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture. This pertains to their immersion. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.18.1">Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. They sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.18.4">It’s like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread over with white cloth. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.18.5">In the same way, a mendicant sits spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There's no part of their body that's not spread with pure bright mind. This pertains to their immersion. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.19.1">This is that noble spectrum of immersion that the Buddha praised. But there is still more to be done.” </p>
<p id="dn10:2.19.3">“It’s incredible, Master Ānanda, it’s amazing! This noble spectrum of immersion is complete, not lacking anything! Such a complete spectrum of immersion cannot be seen among the other ascetics and brahmins. Were other ascetics and brahmins to see such a complete spectrum of noble immersion in themselves, they’d be delighted with just that much: ‘At this point it’s enough; at this point our work is done. We’ve reached the goal of our ascetic life. There is nothing more to be done.’ And yet you say: ‘But there is still more to be done.’ </p>
<h3 class="subheading">3. The Spectrum of Wisdom </h3>
<p id="dn10:2.20.1">But what, Master Ānanda, was that noble spectrum of wisdom that the Buddha praised?” </p>
<p id="dn10:2.21.1">“When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward knowledge and vision. They understand: ‘This body of mine is physical. It’s made up of the four primary elements, produced by mother and father, built up from rice and porridge, liable to impermanence, to wearing away and erosion, to breaking up and destruction. And this consciousness of mine is attached to it, tied to it.’ </p>
<p id="dn10:2.22.1">Suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed with all good qualities. And it was strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown. And someone with good eyesight were to take it in their hand and examine it: ‘This beryl gem is naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed with all good qualities. And it’s strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown.’ </p>
<p id="dn10:2.22.3">In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward knowledge and vision. This pertains to their wisdom. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.23.1">When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward the creation of a mind-made body. From this body they create another body, physical, mind-made, complete in all its various parts, not deficient in any faculty. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.24.1">Suppose a person was to draw a reed out from its sheath. They’d think: ‘This is the reed, this is the sheath. The reed and the sheath are different things. The reed has been drawn out from the sheath.’ Or suppose a person was to draw a sword out from its scabbard. They’d think: ‘This is the sword, this is the scabbard. The sword and the scabbard are different things. The sword has been drawn out from the scabbard.’ Or suppose a person was to draw a snake out from its slough. They’d think: ‘This is the snake, this is the slough. The snake and the slough are different things. The snake has been drawn out from the slough.’ </p>
<p id="dn10:2.24.10">In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward the creation of a mind-made body. This pertains to their wisdom. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.25.1">When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward psychic power. They wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.26.1">Suppose an expert potter or their apprentice had some well-prepared clay. They could produce any kind of pot that they like. Or suppose an expert ivory-carver or their apprentice had some well-prepared ivory. They could produce any kind of ivory item that they like. Or suppose an expert goldsmith or their apprentice had some well-prepared gold. They could produce any kind of gold item that they like. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.26.4">In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward psychic power. This pertains to their wisdom. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.27.1">When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward clairaudience. With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far. Suppose there was a person traveling along the road. They’d hear the sound of drums, clay drums, horns, kettledrums, and tom-toms. They’d think: ‘That’s the sound of drums,’ and ‘that’s the sound of clay drums,’ and ‘that’s the sound of horns, kettledrums, and tom-toms.’ </p>
<p id="dn10:2.27.4">In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward clairaudience. This pertains to their wisdom. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.28.1">When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward comprehending the minds of others. They understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’, and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’. They understand mind with hate … mind without hate … mind with delusion … mind without delusion … constricted mind … scattered mind … expansive mind … unexpansive mind … mind that is not supreme … mind that is supreme … immersed mind … unimmersed mind … freed mind … They understand unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.29.1">Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and they check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror or a clear bowl of water. If they had a spot they’d know ‘I have a spot,’ and if they had no spots they’d know ‘I have no spots.’ </p>
<p id="dn10:2.29.2">In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward comprehending the minds of others. This pertains to their wisdom. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.30.1">When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward recollection of past lives. They recollect many kinds of past lives, that is, one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.31.1">Suppose a person was to leave their home village and go to another village. From that village they’d go to yet another village. And from that village they’d return to their home village. They’d think: ‘I went from my home village to another village. There I stood like this, sat like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. From that village I went to yet another village. There too I stood like this, sat like that, spoke like this, or kept silent like that. And from that village I returned to my home village.’ </p>
<p id="dn10:2.31.2">In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward recollection of past lives. This pertains to their wisdom. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.32.1">When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings. With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.33.1">Suppose there was a stilt longhouse at the central square. A person with good eyesight standing there might see people entering and leaving a house, walking along the streets and paths, and sitting at the central square. They’d think: ‘These are people entering and leaving a house, walking along the streets and paths, and sitting at the central square.’ </p>
<p id="dn10:2.33.2">In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend and project it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings. This pertains to their wisdom. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.34.1">When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements. They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’. Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.35.3">They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ </p>
<p id="dn10:2.36.1">Suppose that in a mountain glen there was a lake that was transparent, clear, and unclouded. A person with good eyesight standing on the bank would see the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel, and schools of fish swimming about or staying still. They’d think: ‘This lake is transparent, clear, and unclouded. And here are the clams and mussels, and pebbles and gravel, and schools of fish swimming about or staying still.’ </p>
<p id="dn10:2.36.2">In the same way, when their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it and project it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements. This pertains to their wisdom. </p>
<p id="dn10:2.37.1">This is that noble spectrum of wisdom that the Buddha praised. And there is nothing more to be done.” </p>

Such a complete spectrum of wisdom cannot be seen among the other ascetics and brahmins. And there is nothing more to be done. Excellent, Master Ānanda! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Ānanda has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Ānanda remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<p id="dn11:1.7">When he said this, the Buddha said, “Kevaddha, I do not teach the mendicants like this: ‘Come now, mendicants, perform a demonstration of superhuman psychic power for the white-clothed laypeople.’” </p>
<p id="dn11:2.1">For a second time, Kevaddha made the same request, and the Buddha gave the same answer. </p>
<p id="dn11:3.1">For a third time, Kevaddha made the same request, and the Buddha said the following. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">1. The Demonstration of Psychic Power </h3>
<p id="dn11:3.8">“Kevaddha, there are three kinds of demonstration, which I declare having realized them with my own insight. What three? The demonstration of psychic power, the demonstration of revealing, and the demonstration of instruction. </p>
<p id="dn11:4.1">And what is the demonstration of psychic power? It’s a mendicant who wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm. </p>
<p id="dn11:4.3">Then someone with faith and confidence sees that mendicant performing those superhuman feats. </p>
<p id="dn11:4.4">They tell someone else who lacks faith and confidence: ‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! The ascetic has such psychic power and might! I saw him myself, performing all these superhuman feats!’ </p>
<p id="dn11:5.1">But the one lacking faith and confidence would say to them: ‘There’s a spell named Gandhārī. Using that a mendicant can perform such superhuman feats.’ </p>
<p id="dn11:5.4">What do you think, Kevaddha? Wouldn’t someone lacking faith speak like that?” </p>
<p id="dn11:5.6">“They would, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn11:5.7">“Seeing this drawback in psychic power, I’m horrified, repelled, and disgusted by demonstrations of psychic power. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. The Demonstration of Revealing </h3>
<p id="dn11:6.1">And what is the demonstration of revealing? In one case, someone reveals the mind, mentality, thoughts, and reflections of other beings and individuals: ‘This is what you’re thinking, such is your thought, and thus is your state of mind.’ </p>
<p id="dn11:6.4">Then someone with faith and confidence sees that mendicant revealing another person’s thoughts. They tell someone else who lacks faith and confidence: ‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! The ascetic has such psychic power and might! I saw him myself, revealing the thoughts of another person!’ </p>
<p id="dn11:7.1">But the one lacking faith and confidence would say to them: ‘There’s a spell named Māṇikā. Using that a mendicant can reveal another person’s thoughts.’ </p>
<p id="dn11:7.5">What do you think, Kevaddha? Wouldn’t someone lacking faith speak like that?” </p>
<p id="dn11:7.7">“They would, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn11:7.8">“Seeing this drawback in revealing, I’m horrified, repelled, and disgusted by demonstrations of revealing. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">3. The Demonstration of Instruction </h3>
<p id="dn11:8.1">And what is the demonstration of instruction? It’s when a mendicant instructs others like this: ‘Think like this, not like that. Focus your mind like this, not like that. Give up this, and live having achieved that.’ This is called the demonstration of instruction. </p>
<p id="dn11:9-66.1">Furthermore, a Realized One arises in the world … That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. … They enter and remain in the first absorption … This is called the demonstration of instruction. </p>
<p id="dn11:9-66.5">They enter and remain in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. This too is called the demonstration of instruction. </p>
<p id="dn11:9-66.9">They extend and project the mind toward knowledge and vision … This too is called the demonstration of instruction. </p>
<p id="dn11:9-66.11">They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ This too is called the demonstration of instruction. </p>
<p id="dn11:67.1">These, Kevaddha, are the three kinds of demonstration, which I declare having realized them with my own insight. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">4. On the Mendicant In Search of the Cessation of Being </h3>
<p id="dn11:67.3">Once it so happened, Kevaddha, that a mendicant in this very Saṅgha had the following thought, ‘Where do these four primary elements cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?’ </p>
<p id="dn11:68.1">Then that mendicant attained a state of immersion such that a path to the gods appeared. Then he approached the Gods of the Four Great Kings and said, ‘Reverends, where do these four primary elements cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?’ </p>
<p id="dn11:68.4">When he said this, those gods said to him, ‘Mendicant, we too do not know this. But the Four Great Kings are our superiors. They might know.’ </p>
<p id="dn11:69.1">Then he approached the Four Great Kings and asked the same question. But they also said to him, ‘Mendicant, we too do not know this. But the gods of the Thirty-Three … Sakka, lord of gods … the gods of Yāmā … the god named Suyāma … the Joyful gods … the god named Santussita … the gods who delight in creation … the god named Sunimmita … the gods who control the creation of others … the god named Vasavattī … the gods of Brahmā’s Host. They might know.’ </p>
<p id="dn11:80.1">Then that mendicant attained a state of immersion such that a path to Brahmā appeared. Then he approached those gods and said, ‘Reverends, where do these four primary elements cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?’ But they also said to him, ‘Mendicant, we too do not know this. But there is Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born. He is our superior. He might know.’ </p>
<p id="dn11:80.10">‘But reverends, where is that Brahmā now?’ ‘We also don’t know where he is or what way he lies. But by the signs that are seen—light arising and radiance appearing—we know that Brahmā will appear. For this is the precursor for the appearance of Brahmā, namely light arising and radiance appearing.’ Not long afterwards, the Great Brahmā appeared. </p>
<p id="dn11:81.2">Then that mendicant approached the Great Brahmā and said to him, ‘Reverend, where do these four primary elements cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?’ The Great Brahmā said to him, ‘I am Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born.’ </p>
<p id="dn11:82.1">For a second time, that mendicant said to the Great Brahmā, ‘Reverend, I am not asking you whether you are Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born. I am asking where these four primary elements cease without anything left over.’ </p>
<p id="dn11:82.6">For a second time, the Great Brahmā said to him, ‘I am Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born.’ For a third time, that mendicant said to the Great Brahmā, ‘Reverend, I am not asking you whether you are Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born. I am asking where these four primary elements cease without anything left over.’ </p>
<p id="dn11:83.6">Then the Great Brahmā took that mendicant by the arm, led him off to one side, and said to him, ‘Mendicant, these gods think that there is nothing at all that I don’t know and see and understand and realize. That’s why I didn’t answer in front of them. But I too do not know where these four primary elements cease with nothing left over. Therefore, mendicant, the misdeed is yours alone, the mistake is yours alone, in that you passed over the Buddha and searched elsewhere for an answer to this question. Mendicant, go to the Buddha and ask him this question. You should remember it in line with his answer.’ </p>
<p id="dn11:84.1">Then that mendicant, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of me. Then he bowed, sat down to one side, and said to me, ‘Sir, where do these four primary elements cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?’ </p>
<h4 class="subheading">4.1. The Simile of the Land-Spotting Bird </h4>
<p id="dn11:85.1">When he said this, I said to him: </p>
<p id="dn11:85.2">‘Once upon a time, mendicant, some sea-merchants set sail for the ocean deeps, taking with them a land-spotting bird. When their ship was out of sight of land, they released the bird. It flew right away to the east, the west, the north, the south, upwards, and in-between. If it saw land on any side, it went there and stayed. But if it saw no land on any side it returned to the ship. </p>
<p id="dn11:85.7">In the same way, after failing to get an answer to this question even after searching as far as the Brahmā realm, you’ve returned to me. Mendicant, this is not how the question should be asked: “Sir, where do these four primary elements cease without anything left over, namely, the elements of earth, water, fire, and air?” </p>
<p id="dn11:85.10">This is how the question should be asked: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn11:85.11">“Where do water and earth, <br/>fire and air find no footing; <br/>where do long and short, <br/>fine and coarse, beautiful and ugly; <br/>where do name and form <br/>cease with nothing left over?” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn11:85.17">And the answer to that is: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn11:85.18">“Consciousness that’s invisible, <br/>infinite, entirely given up: <br/>that’s where water and earth, <br/>fire and air find no footing. </p>
<p id="dn11:85.22">And that’s where long and short, <br/>fine and coarse, beautiful and ugly—<br/>that’s where name and form <br/>cease with nothing left over. <br/>With the cessation of consciousness, <br/>that’s where they cease.”’” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn11:85.28">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the householder Kevaddha was happy with what the Buddha said. </p>

<h2 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">DN 12</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">With Lohicca </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Lohiccasutta</span></h2>
<p id="dn12:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at Sālavatikā. </p>
<p id="dn12:1.3">Now at that time the brahmin Lohicca was living in Sālavatikā. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal endowment of the highest quality. </p>
<p id="dn12:2.1">Now at that time Lohicca had the following harmful misconception: “Should an ascetic or brahmin achieve some skillful quality, they ought not inform anyone else. For what can one person do for another? Suppose someone cut off an old bond, only to create another new bond. That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one person do for another?” </p>
<p id="dn12:3.1">Lohicca heard: </p>
<p id="dn12:3.2">“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Sālavatikā, together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.” </p>
<p id="dn12:4.1">Then Lohicca addressed his barber Rosika, “Here, dear Rosika, go to the ascetic Gotama and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Ask him if he is healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. And then ask him whether he, together with the mendicant Saṅgha, might please accept tomorrow’s meal from the brahmin Lohicca.” </p>
<p id="dn12:5.1">“Yes, sir,” Rosika replied. He did as he was asked, and the Buddha consented in silence. </p>
<p id="dn12:6.1">Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Rosika got up from his seat, went to Lohicca, and said to him, “I gave the Buddha your message, and he accepted.” </p>
<p id="dn12:7.1">And when the night had passed Lohicca had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, “Here, dear Rosika, go to the ascetic Gotama and announce the time, saying: ‘It’s time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.’” </p>
<p id="dn12:7.4">“Yes, sir,” Rosika replied. He did as he was asked. </p>
<p id="dn12:7.7">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Sālavatikā together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Now, Rosika was following behind the Buddha, and told him of Lohicca’s views, adding, “Sir, please dissuade him from that harmful misconception.” </p>
<p id="dn12:8.10">“Hopefully that’ll happen, Rosika, hopefully that’ll happen.” </p>
<p id="dn12:9.1">Then the Buddha approached Lohicca’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Lohicca served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">1. Questioning Lohicca </h3>
<p id="dn12:9.4">When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Lohicca took a low seat and sat to one side. </p>
<p id="dn12:9.5">The Buddha said to him, “Is it really true, Lohicca, that you have such a harmful misconception: ‘Should an ascetic or brahmin achieve some skillful quality, they ought not inform anyone else. For what can one person do for another? Suppose someone cut off an old bond, only to create another new bond. That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one person do for another?’” </p>
<p id="dn12:9.10">“Yes, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn12:10.1">“What do you think, Lohicca? Do you reside in Sālavatikā?” </p>
<p id="dn12:10.3">“Yes, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn12:10.4">“Lohicca, suppose someone were to say: ‘The brahmin Lohicca reigns over Sālavatikā. He alone should enjoy the revenues produced in Sālavatikā and not share them with anyone else.’ Would the person who spoke like that make it difficult for those whose living depends on you or not?” </p>
<p id="dn12:10.8">“They would, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn12:10.9">“But is someone who creates difficulties for others acting kindly or unkindly?” </p>
<p id="dn12:10.10">“Unkindly, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn12:10.11">“But does an unkind person have love in their heart or hostility?” </p>
<p id="dn12:10.12">“Hostility, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn12:10.13">“And when the heart is full of hostility, is there right view or wrong view?” </p>
<p id="dn12:10.14">“Wrong view, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn12:10.15">“An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say: hell or the animal realm. </p>
<p id="dn12:11.1">What do you think, Lohicca? Does King Pasenadi reign over Kāsī and Kosala?” </p>
<p id="dn12:11.3">“Yes, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn12:11.4">“Lohicca, suppose someone were to say: ‘King Pasenadi reigns over Kāsī and Kosala. He alone should enjoy the revenues produced in Kāsī and Kosala and not share them with anyone else.’ Would the person who spoke like that make it difficult for yourself and others whose living depends on King Pasenadi or not?” </p>
<p id="dn12:11.8">“They would, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn12:11.9">“But is someone who creates difficulties for others acting kindly or unkindly?” </p>
<p id="dn12:11.10">“Unkindly, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn12:11.11">“But does an unkind person have love in their heart or hostility?” </p>
<p id="dn12:11.12">“Hostility, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn12:11.13">“And when the heart is full of hostility, is there right view or wrong view?” </p>
<p id="dn12:11.14">“Wrong view, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn12:11.15">“An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say: hell or the animal realm. </p>
<p id="dn12:12.1">So it seems, Lohicca, that should someone say such a thing either of Lohicca or of King Pasenadi, that is wrong view. </p>
<p id="dn12:13.3">In the same way, suppose someone were to say: ‘Should an ascetic or brahmin achieve some skillful quality, they ought not inform anyone else. For what can one person do for another? Suppose someone cut off an old bond, only to create another new bond. That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one person do for another?’ </p>
<p id="dn12:13.7">Now, there are gentlemen who, relying on the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One, achieve a high distinction such as the following: they realize the fruit of stream-entry, the fruit of once-return, the fruit of non-return, or the fruit of perfection. And in addition, there are those who ripen the seeds for rebirth in a heavenly state. The person who spoke like that makes it difficult for them. They’re acting unkindly, their heart is full of hostility, and they have wrong view. An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say: hell or the animal realm. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. Three Teachers Who Deserve to Be Reprimanded </h3>
<p id="dn12:16.1">Lohicca, there are three kinds of teachers in the world who deserve to be reprimanded. When someone reprimands such teachers, the reprimand is true, substantive, legitimate, and blameless. What three? </p>
<p id="dn12:16.4">Firstly, take a teacher who has not reached the goal of the ascetic life for which they went forth from the lay life to homelessness. They teach their disciples: ‘This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’ But their disciples don’t want to listen. They don’t pay attention or apply their minds to understand. They proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction. That teacher deserves to be reprimanded: ‘Venerable, you haven’t reached the goal of the ascetic life; and when you teach disciples they proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction. It’s like a man who makes advances on a woman though she pulls away, or embraces her though she turns her back. That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one do for another?’ This is the first kind of teacher who deserves to be reprimanded. </p>
<p id="dn12:17.1">Furthermore, take a teacher who has not reached the goal of the ascetic life for which they went forth from the lay life to homelessness. They teach their disciples: ‘This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’ Their disciples do want to listen. They pay attention and apply their minds to understand. They don’t proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction. That teacher deserves to be reprimanded: ‘Venerable, you haven’t reached the goal of the ascetic life; and when you teach disciples they don’t proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction. It’s like someone who abandons their own field and presumes to weed someone else’s field. That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one do for another?’ This is the second kind of teacher who deserves to be reprimanded. </p>
<p id="dn12:18.1">Furthermore, take a teacher who has reached the goal of the ascetic life for which they went forth from the lay life to homelessness. They teach their disciples: ‘This is for your welfare. This is for your happiness.’ But their disciples don’t want to listen. They don’t pay attention or apply their minds to understand. They proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction. That teacher deserves to be reprimanded: ‘Venerable, you have reached the goal of the ascetic life; yet when you teach disciples they proceed having turned away from the teacher’s instruction. Suppose someone cut off an old bond, only to create another new bond. That’s the consequence of such a wicked, greedy deed, I say. For what can one person do for another?’ This is the third kind of teacher who deserves to be reprimanded. </p>
<p id="dn12:18.14">These are the three kinds of teachers in the world who deserve to be reprimanded. When someone reprimands such teachers, the reprimand is true, substantive, legitimate, and blameless.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">3. A Teacher Who Does Not Deserve to Be Reprimanded </h3>
<p id="dn12:19.1">When he had spoken, Lohicca said to the Buddha, “But Master Gotama, is there a teacher in the world who does not deserve to be reprimanded?” </p>
<p id="dn12:19.3">“There is, Lohicca.” </p>
<p id="dn12:19.4">“But who is that teacher?” </p>
<p id="dn12:20-55.1">“It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. … They enter and remain in the first absorption … A teacher under whom a disciple achieves such a high distinction is one who does not deserve to be reprimanded. When someone reprimands such a teacher, the reprimand is false, baseless, illegitimate, and blameworthy. </p>
<p id="dn12:56-62.1">They enter and remain in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. A teacher under whom a disciple achieves such a high distinction is one who does not deserve to be reprimanded. … </p>
<p id="dn12:63-77.1">They extend and project the mind toward knowledge and vision … A teacher under whom a disciple achieves such a high distinction is one who does not deserve to be reprimanded. … </p>
<p id="dn12:63-77.4">They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ A teacher under whom a disciple achieves such a high distinction is one who does not deserve to be reprimanded. When someone reprimands such a teacher, the reprimand is false, baseless, illegitimate, and blameworthy.” </p>
<p id="dn12:78.1">When he had spoken, Lohicca said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="dn12:78.2">“Suppose, Master Gotama, a person was on the verge of falling off a cliff, and another person were to grab them by the hair, pull them up, and place them on firm ground. In the same way, when I was falling off a cliff Master Gotama pulled me up and placed me on safe ground. </p>
<p id="dn12:78.4">Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the Teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<article id="dn13">
<h2 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">DN 13</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">The Three Knowledges </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Tevijjasutta</span></h2>
<p id="dn13:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Manasākaṭa. He stayed in a mango grove on a bank of the river Aciravatī to the north of Manasākaṭa. </p>
<p id="dn13:2.1">Now at that time several very well-known well-to-do brahmins were residing in Manasākaṭa. They included the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jāṇussoṇi, Todeyya, and others. </p>
<p id="dn13:3.1">Then as the students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began a discussion regarding the variety of paths. </p>
<p id="dn13:4.1">Vāseṭṭha said this: “This is the only straight path, the direct route that leads someone who practices it to the company of Brahmā; namely, that explained by the brahmin Pokkharasāti.” </p>
<p id="dn13:5.1">Bhāradvāja said this: “This is the only straight path, the direct route that leads someone who practices it to the company of Brahmā; namely, that explained by the brahmin Tārukkha.” </p>
<p id="dn13:6.1">But neither was able to persuade the other. So Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvāja, “Bhāradvāja, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying in a mango grove on a bank of the river Aciravatī to the north of Manasākaṭa. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ Come, let’s go to see him and ask him about this matter. As he answers, so we’ll remember it.” </p>
<p id="dn13:7.7">“Yes, sir,” replied Bhāradvāja. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">1. The Variety of Paths </h3>
<p id="dn13:8.1">So they went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and Vāseṭṭha told him of their conversation, adding: “In this matter we have a dispute, a disagreement, a difference of opinion.” </p>
<p id="dn13:9.1">“So, Vāseṭṭha, it seems that you say that the straight path is that explained by Pokkharasāti, while Bhāradvāja says that the straight path is that explained by Tārukkha. But what exactly is your disagreement about?” </p>
<p id="dn13:10.1">“About the variety of paths, Master Gotama. Even though brahmins describe different paths—the Addhariya brahmins, the Tittiriya brahmins, the Chandoka brahmins, and the Bavhadija brahmins—all of them lead someone who practices them to the company of Brahmā. </p>
<p id="dn13:10.3">It’s like a village or town that has many different roads nearby, yet all of them meet at that village. In the same way, even though brahmins describe different paths—the Addhariya brahmins, the Tittiriya brahmins, the Chandoka brahmins, and the Bavhadija brahmins—all of them lead someone who practices them to the company of Brahmā.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. Questioning Vāseṭṭha </h3>
<p id="dn13:11.1">“Do you say, ‘they lead someone’, Vāseṭṭha?” </p>
<p id="dn13:11.2">“I do, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn13:11.3">“Do you say, ‘they lead someone’, Vāseṭṭha?” </p>
<p id="dn13:11.4">“I do, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn13:11.5">“Do you say, ‘they lead someone’, Vāseṭṭha?” </p>
<p id="dn13:11.6">“I do, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn13:12.1">“Well, of the brahmins who are proficient in the three Vedas, Vāseṭṭha, is there even a single one who has seen Brahmā with their own eyes?” </p>
<p id="dn13:12.2">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn13:12.3">“Well, has even a single one of their teachers seen Brahmā with their own eyes?” </p>
<p id="dn13:12.4">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn13:12.5">“Well, has even a single one of their teachers’ teachers seen Brahmā with their own eyes?” </p>
<p id="dn13:12.6">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn13:12.7">“Well, has anyone back to the seventh generation of teachers seen Brahmā with their own eyes?” </p>
<p id="dn13:12.8">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn13:13.1">“Well, what of the ancient hermits of the brahmins, namely Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu? They were the authors and propagators of the hymns. Their hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times; and these days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it, chanting what was chanted and teaching what was taught. Did they say: ‘We know and see where Brahmā is or what way he lies’?” </p>
<p id="dn13:13.4">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn13:14.1">“So it seems that none of the brahmins have seen Brahmā with their own eyes, and not even the ancient hermits claimed to know where he is. Yet the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas say: ‘We teach the path to the company of that which we neither know nor see. This is the only straight path, the direct route that leads someone who practices it to the company of Brahmā.’ </p>
<p id="dn13:14.10">What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? This being so, doesn’t their statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?” </p>
<p id="dn13:14.12">“Clearly that’s the case, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn13:15.1">“Good, Vāseṭṭha. For it is impossible that they should teach the path to that which they neither know nor see. </p>
<p id="dn13:15.2">Suppose there was a queue of blind men, each holding the one in front: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see. In the same way, it seems to me that the brahmins’ statement turns out to be comparable to a queue of blind men: the first one does not see, the middle one does not see, and the last one does not see. Their statement turns out to be a joke—mere words, void and hollow. </p>
<p id="dn13:16.1">What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Do the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas see the sun and moon just as other folk do? And do they pray to them and exalt them, following their course from where they rise to where they set with joined palms held in worship?” </p>
<p id="dn13:16.3">“Yes, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn13:17.1">“What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Though this is so, are the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas able to teach the path to the company of the sun and moon, saying: ‘This is the only straight path, the direct route that leads someone who practices it to the company of the sun and moon’?” </p>
<p id="dn13:17.4">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn13:18.1">“So it seems that even though the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas see the sun and moon, they are not able to teach the path to the company of the sun and moon. </p>
<p id="dn13:18.3">But it seems that even though they have not seen Brahmā with their own eyes, they still claim to teach the path to the company of that which they neither know nor see. </p>
<p id="dn13:18.11">What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? This being so, doesn’t their statement turn out to have no demonstrable basis?” </p>
<p id="dn13:18.13">“Clearly that’s the case, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn13:18.14">“Good, Vāseṭṭha. For it is impossible that they should teach the path to that which they neither know nor see. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.1. The Simile of the Finest Lady in the Land </h4>

<p id="dn13:19.3">They’d say to him, ‘Mister, that finest lady in the land who you desire—do you know whether she’s an aristocrat, a brahmin, a merchant, or a worker?’ Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’ </p>

<p id="dn13:19.9">Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’ </p>

<h4 class="subheading">2.2. The Simile of the Ladder </h4>
<p id="dn13:21.1">Suppose a man was to build a ladder at the crossroads for climbing up to a stilt longhouse. </p>
<p id="dn13:21.2">They’d say to him, ‘Mister, that stilt longhouse that you’re building a ladder for—do you know whether it’s to the north, south, east, or west? Or whether it’s tall or short or medium?’ </p>
<p id="dn13:21.4">Asked this, he’d say, ‘No.’ </p>

<h4 class="subheading">2.3. The Simile of the River Aciravatī </h4>
<p id="dn13:24.1">Suppose the river Aciravatī was full to the brim so a crow could drink from it. Then along comes a person who wants to cross over to the far shore. Standing on the near shore, they’d call out to the far shore, ‘Come here, far shore! Come here, far shore!’ </p>
<p id="dn13:24.5">What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Would the far shore of the Aciravatī river come over to the near shore because of that man’s call, request, desire, or expectation?” </p>
<p id="dn13:24.7">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn13:25.1">“In the same way, Vāseṭṭha, the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas proceed having given up those things that make one a true brahmin, and having undertaken those things that make one not a true brahmin. Yet they say: ‘We call upon Indra! We call upon Soma! We call upon Varuṇa! We call upon Īsāna! We call upon Pajāpati! We call upon Brahmā! We call upon Mahiddhi! We call upon Yama!’ </p>
<p id="dn13:25.3">So long as they proceed in this way it’s impossible that they will, when the body breaks up, after death, be reborn in the company of Brahmā. </p>
<p id="dn13:26.1">Suppose the river Aciravatī was full to the brim so a crow could drink from it. Then along comes a person who wants to cross over to the far shore. But while still on the near shore, their arms are tied tightly behind their back with a strong chain. </p>
<p id="dn13:26.4">What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Could that person cross over to the far shore?” </p>
<p id="dn13:26.6">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn13:27.1">“In the same way, the five kinds of sensual stimulation are called ‘chains’ and ‘fetters’ in the training of the Noble One. What five? Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. Sounds known by the ear … Smells known by the nose … Tastes known by the tongue … Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. </p>
<p id="dn13:27.8">These are the five kinds of sensual stimulation that are called ‘chains’ and ‘fetters’ in the training of the Noble One. The brahmins proficient in the three Vedas enjoy these five kinds of sensual stimulation tied, infatuated, attached, blind to the drawbacks, and not understanding the escape. So long as they enjoy them it’s impossible that they will, when the body breaks up, after death, be reborn in the company of Brahmā. </p>
<p id="dn13:29.1">Suppose the river Aciravatī was full to the brim so a crow could drink from it. Then along comes a person who wants to cross over to the far shore. But they’d lie down wrapped in cloth from head to foot. </p>
<p id="dn13:29.4">What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Could that person cross over to the far shore?” </p>
<p id="dn13:29.6">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn13:30.1">“In the same way, the five hindrances are called ‘obstacles’ and ‘hindrances’ and ‘coverings’ and ‘shrouds’ in the training of the Noble One. What five? The hindrances of sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. These five hindrances are called ‘obstacles’ and ‘hindrances’ and ‘coverings’ and ‘shrouds’ in the training of the Noble One. </p>
<p id="dn13:30.5">The brahmins proficient in the three Vedas are obstructed, shrouded, covered, and engulfed by these five hindrances. So long as they are so obstructed it’s impossible that they will, when the body breaks up, after death, be reborn in the company of Brahmā. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">3. Converging </h3>
<p id="dn13:31.1">What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Have you heard that the brahmins who are elderly and senior, the teachers of teachers, say whether Brahmā is possessive or not?” </p>
<p id="dn13:31.3">“That he is not, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn13:31.4">“Is his heart full of enmity or not?” </p>
<p id="dn13:31.5">“It is not.” </p>
<p id="dn13:31.6">“Is his heart full of ill will or not?” </p>
<p id="dn13:31.7">“It is not.” </p>
<p id="dn13:31.8">“Is his heart corrupted or not?” </p>
<p id="dn13:31.9">“It is not.” </p>
<p id="dn13:31.10">“Does he wield power or not?” </p>
<p id="dn13:31.11">“He does.” </p>
<p id="dn13:32.1">“What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Are the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas possessive or not?” </p>
<p id="dn13:32.3">“They are.” </p>
<p id="dn13:32.4">“Are their hearts full of enmity or not?” </p>
<p id="dn13:32.5">“They are.” </p>
<p id="dn13:32.6">“Are their hearts full of ill will or not?” </p>
<p id="dn13:32.7">“They are.” </p>
<p id="dn13:32.8">“Are their hearts corrupted or not?” </p>
<p id="dn13:32.9">“They are.” </p>
<p id="dn13:32.10">“Do they wield power or not?” </p>
<p id="dn13:32.11">“They do not.” </p>
<p id="dn13:33.1">“So it seems that the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas are possessive, but Brahmā is not. But would brahmins who are possessive come together and converge with Brahmā, who isn’t possessive?” </p>
<p id="dn13:33.3">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn13:34.1">“Good, Vāseṭṭha! It’s impossible that the brahmins who are possessive will, when the body breaks up, after death, be reborn in the company of Brahmā, who isn’t possessive. </p>
<p id="dn13:35.1">And it seems that the brahmins have enmity, ill will, corruption, and do not wield power, while Brahmā is the opposite in all these things. But would brahmins who are opposite to Brahmā in all things come together and converge with him?” </p>
<p id="dn13:35.5">“No, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn13:36.1">“Good, Vāseṭṭha! It’s impossible that such brahmins will, when the body breaks up, after death, be reborn in the company of Brahmā. </p>
<p id="dn13:36.2">But here the brahmins proficient in the three Vedas sink down where they have sat, only to be torn apart; all the while imagining that they’re crossing over to drier ground. That’s why the three Vedas of the brahmins are called a ‘salted land’ and a ‘barren land’ and a ‘disaster’.” </p>
<p id="dn13:37.1">When he said this, Vāseṭṭha said to the Buddha, “I have heard, Master Gotama, that you know the path to company with Brahmā.” </p>
<p id="dn13:37.3">“What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Is the village of Manasākaṭa nearby?” </p>
<p id="dn13:37.5">“Yes it is.” </p>
<p id="dn13:37.6">“What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? Suppose a person was born and raised in Manasākaṭa. And as soon as they left the town some people asked them for the road to Manasākaṭa. Would they be slow or hesitant to answer?” </p>
<p id="dn13:37.10">“No, Master Gotama. Why is that? Because they were born and raised in Manasākaṭa. They’re well acquainted with all the roads to the village.” </p>
<p id="dn13:38.1">“Still, it’s possible they might be slow or hesitant to answer. But the Realized One is never slow or hesitant when questioned about the Brahmā realm or the practice that leads to the Brahmā realm. I understand Brahmā, the Brahmā realm, and the practice that leads to the Brahmā realm, practicing in accordance with which one is reborn in the Brahmā realm.” </p>
<p id="dn13:39.1">When he said this, Vāseṭṭha said to the Buddha, “I have heard, Master Gotama, that you teach the path to company with Brahmā. Please teach us that path and elevate this generation of brahmins.” </p>
<p id="dn13:39.4">“Well then, Vāseṭṭha, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="dn13:39.5">“Yes, sir,” replied Vāseṭṭha. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">4. Teaching the Path to Brahmā </h3>
<p id="dn13:40-75.1">The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="dn13:40-75.2">“It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. … Seeing that the hindrances have been given up in them, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed. </p>
<p id="dn13:76.1">They meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. </p>
<p id="dn13:77.1">Suppose there was a powerful horn blower. They’d easily make themselves heard in the four quarters. In the same way, when the heart’s release by love has been developed like this, any limited deeds they’ve done don’t remain or persist there. This is a path to companionship with Brahmā. </p>
<p id="dn13:78.1">Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion … </p>
<p id="dn13:78.2">They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing … </p>
<p id="dn13:78.3">They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. </p>
<p id="dn13:79.1">Suppose there was a powerful horn blower. They’d easily make themselves heard in the four quarters. In the same way, when the heart’s release by equanimity has been developed and cultivated like this, any limited deeds they’ve done don’t remain or persist there. This too is a path to companionship with Brahmā. </p>
<p id="dn13:80.1">What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? When a mendicant meditates like this, are they possessive or not?” </p>
<p id="dn13:80.3">“They are not.” </p>
<p id="dn13:80.4">“Is their heart full of enmity or not?” </p>
<p id="dn13:80.5">“It is not.” </p>
<p id="dn13:80.6">“Is their heart full of ill will or not?” </p>
<p id="dn13:80.7">“It is not.” </p>
<p id="dn13:80.8">“Is their heart corrupted or not?” </p>
<p id="dn13:80.9">“It is not.” </p>
<p id="dn13:80.10">“Do they wield power or not?” </p>
<p id="dn13:80.11">“They do.” </p>
<p id="dn13:81.1">“So it seems that that mendicant is not possessive, and neither is Brahmā. Would a mendicant who is not possessive come together and converge with Brahmā, who isn’t possessive?” </p>
<p id="dn13:81.3">“Yes, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn13:81.4">“Good, Vāseṭṭha! It’s possible that a mendicant who is not possessive will, when the body breaks up, after death, be reborn in the company of Brahmā, who isn’t possessive. </p>
<p id="dn13:81.5">And it seems that that mendicant has no enmity, ill will, corruption, and does wield power, while Brahmā is the same in all these things. Would a mendicant who is the same as Brahmā in all things come together and converge with him?” </p>
<p id="dn13:81.9">“Yes, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn13:81.10">“Good, Vāseṭṭha! It’s possible that that mendicant will, when the body breaks up, after death, be reborn in the company of Brahmā.” </p>
<p id="dn13:82.1">When he had spoken, Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja said to him, “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<h3 class="subheading">1. On Past Lives </h3>
<p id="dn14:1.1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery, in the hut by the kari tree. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.1.3">Then after the meal, on return from almsround, several senior mendicants sat together in the pavilion by the kari tree and this Dhamma talk on the subject of past lives came up among them, “So it was in a past life; such it was in a past life.” </p>
<p id="dn14:1.2.1">With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard that discussion among the mendicants. So he got up from his seat and went to the pavilion, where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?” </p>
<p id="dn14:1.2.4">The mendicants told him what had happened, adding, “This is the conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.” </p>
<p id="dn14:1.3.1">“Would you like to hear a Dhamma talk on the subject of past lives?” </p>
<p id="dn14:1.3.2">“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! Let the Buddha give a Dhamma talk on the subject of past lives. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” </p>
<p id="dn14:1.3.4">“Well then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="dn14:1.3.5">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="dn14:1.4.1">“Ninety-one eons ago, the Buddha Vipassī arose in the world, perfected and fully awakened. Thirty-one eons ago, the Buddha Sikhī arose in the world, perfected and fully awakened. In the same thirty-first eon, the Buddha Vessabhū arose in the world, perfected and fully awakened. In the present fortunate eon, the Buddhas Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa arose in the world, perfected and fully awakened. And in the present fortunate eon, I have arisen in the world, perfected and fully awakened. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.5.1">The Buddhas Vipassī, Sikhī, and Vessabhū were born as aristocrats into aristocrat families. The Buddhas Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa were born as brahmins into brahmin families. I was born as an aristocrat into an aristocrat family. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.6.1">Koṇḍañña was the clan of Vipassī, Sikhī, and Vessabhū. Kassapa was the clan of Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa. Gotama is my clan. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.7.1">Vipassī lived for 80,000 years. Sikhī lived for 70,000 years. Vessabhū lived for 60,000 years. Kakusandha lived for 40,000 years. Koṇāgamana lived for 30,000 years. Kassapa lived for 20,000 years. For me these days the life-span is short, brief, and fleeting. A long-lived person lives for a century or a little more. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.8.1">Vipassī was awakened at the root of a trumpet flower tree. Sikhī was awakened at the root of a white-mango tree. Vessabhū was awakened at the root of a sal tree. Kakusandha was awakened at the root of an acacia tree. Koṇāgamana was awakened at the root of a cluster fig tree. Kassapa was awakened at the root of a banyan tree. I was awakened at the root of a peepul tree. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.9.1">Vipassī had a fine pair of chief disciples named Khaṇḍa and Tissa. Sikhī had a fine pair of chief disciples named Abhibhū and Sambhava. Vessabhū had a fine pair of chief disciples named Soṇa and Uttara. Kakusandha had a fine pair of chief disciples named Vidhura and Sañjīva. Koṇāgamana had a fine pair of chief disciples named Bhiyyosa and Uttara. Kassapa had a fine pair of chief disciples named Tissa and Bhāradvāja. I have a fine pair of chief disciples named Sāriputta and Moggallāna. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.10.1">Vipassī had three gatherings of disciples—one of 6,800,000, one of 100,000, and one of 80,000—all of them mendicants who had ended their defilements. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.10.2">Sikhī had three gatherings of disciples—one of 100,000, one of 80,000, and one of 70,000—all of them mendicants who had ended their defilements. </p>

<p id="dn14:1.10.7">I have had one gathering of disciples—1,250 mendicants who had ended their defilements. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.11.1">Vipassī had as chief attendant a mendicant named Asoka. Sikhī had as chief attendant a mendicant named Khemaṅkara. Vessabhū had as chief attendant a mendicant named Upasanta. Kakusandha had as chief attendant a mendicant named Buddhija. Koṇāgamana had as chief attendant a mendicant named Sotthija. Kassapa had as chief attendant a mendicant named Sabbamitta. I have as chief attendant a mendicant named Ānanda. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.12.1">Vipassī’s father was King Bandhuma, his birth mother was Queen Bandhumatī, and their capital city was named Bandhumatī. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.12.4">Sikhī’s father was King Aruṇa, his birth mother was Queen Pabhāvatī, and their capital city was named Aruṇavatī. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.12.7">Vessabhū’s father was King Suppatīta, his birth mother was Queen Vassavatī, and their capital city was named Anoma. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.12.10">Kakusandha’s father was the brahmin Aggidatta, and his birth mother was the brahmin lady Visākhā. At that time the king was Khema, whose capital city was named Khemavatī. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.12.14">Koṇāgamana’s father was the brahmin Yaññadatta, and his birth mother was the brahmin lady Uttarā. At that time the king was Sobha, whose capital city was named Sobhavatī. </p>

<p id="dn14:1.12.22">In this life, my father was King Suddhodana, my birth mother was Queen Māyā, and our capital city was Kapilavatthu.” </p>
<p id="dn14:1.12.25">That is what the Buddha said. When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.13.1">Soon after the Buddha left, those mendicants discussed among themselves: </p>
<p id="dn14:1.13.2">“It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing, the power and might of a Realized One! For he is able to recollect the caste, names, clans, life-span, chief disciples, and gatherings of disciples of the Buddhas of the past who have become completely extinguished, cut off proliferation, cut off the track, finished off the cycle, and transcended suffering. He knows the caste they were born in, and also their names, clans, conduct, qualities, wisdom, meditation, and freedom. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.13.5">Is it because the Realized One has clearly comprehended the principle of the teachings that he can recollect all these things? Or did deities tell him?” But this conversation among those mendicants was left unfinished. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.14.1">Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the pavilion by the kari tree, where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?” </p>
<p id="dn14:1.14.4">The mendicants told him what had happened, adding, “This was our conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.” </p>
<p id="dn14:1.15.1">“It is because the Realized One has clearly comprehended the principle of the teachings that he can recollect all these things. And the deities also told me. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.15.5">Would you like to hear a further Dhamma talk on the subject of past lives?” </p>
<p id="dn14:1.15.6">“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! Let the Buddha give a further Dhamma talk on the subject of past lives. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” </p>
<p id="dn14:1.15.8">“Well then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="dn14:1.15.9">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="dn14:1.16.1">“Ninety-one eons ago, the Buddha Vipassī arose in the world, perfected and fully awakened. He was born as an aristocrat into an aristocrat family. His clan was Koṇḍañña. He lived for 80,000 years. He was awakened at the root of a trumpet flower tree. He had a fine pair of chief disciples named Khaṇḍa and Tissa. He had three gatherings of disciples—one of 6,800,000, one of 100,000, and one of 80,000—all of them mendicants who had ended their defilements. He had as chief attendant a mendicant named Asoka. His father was King Bandhuma, his birth mother was Queen Bandhumatī, and their capital city was named Bandhumatī. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. What’s Normal For One Intent on Awakening </h3>
<p data-counter="1" id="dn14:1.17.1">When Vipassī, the being intent on awakening, passed away from the host of Joyful Gods, he was conceived in his mother’s womb, mindful and aware. This is normal in such a case. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="dn14:1.17.3">It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening passes away from the host of Joyful Gods, he is conceived in his mother’s womb. And then—in this world with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—an immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the gods. Even in the boundless desolation of interstellar space—so utterly dark that even the light of the moon and the sun, so mighty and powerful, makes no impression—an immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the gods. And the sentient beings reborn there recognize each other by that light: ‘So, it seems other sentient beings have been reborn here!’ And this galaxy shakes and rocks and trembles. And an immeasurable, magnificent light appears in the world, surpassing the glory of the gods. This is normal in such a case. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="dn14:1.17.9">It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, four gods approach to guard the four quarters, so that no human or non-human or anyone at all shall harm the being intent on awakening or his mother. This is normal in such a case. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="dn14:1.18.1">It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, she becomes naturally ethical. She refrains from killing living creatures, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, and alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. This is normal in such a case. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="dn14:1.19.1">It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, she no longer feels sexual desire for men, and she cannot be violated by a man of lustful intent. This is normal in such a case. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="dn14:1.20.1">It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, she obtains the five kinds of sensual stimulation and amuses herself, supplied and provided with them. This is normal in such a case. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.21.1">It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, no afflictions beset her. She’s happy and free of bodily fatigue. And she sees the being intent on awakening in her womb, complete with all his various parts, not deficient in any faculty. Suppose there was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed with all good qualities. And it was strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown. And someone with good eyesight were to take it in their hand and examine it: ‘This beryl gem is naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed with all good qualities. And it’s strung with a thread of blue, yellow, red, white, or golden brown.’ </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="dn14:1.21.4">In the same way, when the being intent on awakening is conceived in his mother’s belly, no afflictions beset her. She’s happy and free of bodily fatigue. And she sees the being intent on awakening in her womb, complete with all his various parts, not deficient in any faculty. This is normal in such a case. </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="dn14:1.22.1">It’s normal that, seven days after the being intent on awakening is born, his mother passes away and is reborn in the host of Joyful Gods. This is normal in such a case. </p>
<p data-counter="9" id="dn14:1.23.1">It’s normal that, while other women carry the infant in the womb for nine or ten months before giving birth, not so the mother of the being intent on awakening. She gives birth after exactly ten months. This is normal in such a case. </p>
<p data-counter="10" id="dn14:1.24.1">It’s normal that, while other women give birth while sitting or lying down, not so the mother of the being intent on awakening. She only gives birth standing up. This is normal in such a case. </p>
<p data-counter="11" id="dn14:1.25.1">It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening emerges from his mother’s womb, gods receive him first, then humans. This is normal in such a case. </p>
<p data-counter="12" id="dn14:1.26.1">It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening emerges from his mother’s womb, before he reaches the ground, four gods receive him and place him before his mother, saying: ‘Rejoice, O Queen! An illustrious child is born to you.’ This is normal in such a case. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.27.1">It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening emerges from his mother’s womb, he emerges already clean, unsoiled by waters, mucus, blood, or any other kind of impurity, pure and clean. Suppose a jewel-treasure was placed on a cloth from Kāsī. The jewel would not soil the cloth, nor would the cloth soil the jewel. Why is that? Because of the cleanliness of them both. </p>
<p data-counter="13" id="dn14:1.27.5">In the same way, when the being intent on awakening emerges from his mother’s womb, he emerges already clean, unsoiled by waters, mucus, blood, or any other kind of impurity, pure and clean. This is normal in such a case. </p>
<p data-counter="14" id="dn14:1.28.1">It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening emerges from his mother’s womb, two streams of water appear in the sky, one cool, one warm, for bathing the being intent on awakening and his mother. This is normal in such a case. </p>
<p data-counter="15" id="dn14:1.29.1">It’s normal that, as soon as he’s born, the being intent on awakening stands firm with his own feet on the ground. Facing north, he takes seven strides with a white parasol held above him, surveys all quarters, and makes this dramatic proclamation: ‘I am the foremost in the world! I am the eldest in the world! I am the first in the world! This is my last rebirth. Now there are no more future lives.’ This is normal in such a case. </p>
<p data-counter="16" id="dn14:1.30.1">It’s normal that, when the being intent on awakening emerges from his mother’s womb, then—in this world with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—an immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the gods. Even in the boundless desolation of interstellar space—so utterly dark that even the light of the moon and the sun, so mighty and powerful, makes no impression—an immeasurable, magnificent light appears, surpassing the glory of the gods.

<h3 class="subheading">3. The Thirty-Two Marks of a Great Man </h3>
<p id="dn14:1.31.1">When Prince Vipassī was born, they announced it to King Bandhuma, ‘Sire, your son is born! Let your majesty examine him!’ When the king had examined the prince, he had the brahmin soothsayers summoned and said to them, ‘Gentlemen, please examine the prince.’ When they had examined him they said to the king, ‘Rejoice, O King! An illustrious son is born to you. You are fortunate, so very fortunate, to have a son such as this born in this family! For the prince has the thirty-two marks of a great man. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other. If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures. He has the following seven treasures: the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure. He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword. But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.32.1">And what are the marks which he possesses? After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="dn14:1.32.7">He has well-planted feet. </p>

<p data-counter="10" id="dn14:1.32.16">His private parts are covered in a foreskin. </p>
<p data-counter="11" id="dn14:1.32.17">He is gold colored; his skin has a golden sheen. </p>
<p data-counter="12" id="dn14:1.32.18">He has delicate skin, so delicate that dust and dirt don’t stick to his body. </p>
<p data-counter="13" id="dn14:1.32.19">His hairs grow one per pore. </p>
<p data-counter="14" id="dn14:1.32.20">His hairs stand up; they’re blue-black and curl clockwise. </p>
<p data-counter="15" id="dn14:1.32.21">His body is tall and straight. </p>
<p data-counter="16" id="dn14:1.32.22">He has bulging muscles in seven places. </p>
<p data-counter="17" id="dn14:1.32.23">His chest is like that of a lion. </p>
<p data-counter="18" id="dn14:1.32.24">The gap between the shoulder-blades is filled in. </p>
<p data-counter="19" id="dn14:1.32.25">He has the proportional circumference of a banyan tree: the span of his arms equals the height of his body. </p>
<p data-counter="20" id="dn14:1.32.26">His torso is cylindrical. </p>

<p data-counter="32" id="dn14:1.32.38">His head is shaped like a turban. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.33.1">These are the thirty-two marks of a great man that the prince has. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other. If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch. But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world.’ </p>
<h3 class="subheading">4. How He Came to be Known as Vipassī </h3>
<p id="dn14:1.33.9">Then King Bandhuma had the brahmin soothsayers dressed in fresh clothes and satisfied all their needs. Then the king appointed nurses for Prince Vipassī. Some suckled him, some bathed him, some held him, and some carried him on their hip. From when he was born, a white parasol was held over him night and day, with the thought, ‘Don’t let cold, heat, grass, dust, or damp bother him.’ He was dear and beloved by many people, like a blue water lily, or a pink or white lotus. He was always passed from hip to hip. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.35.1">From when he was born, his voice was charming, graceful, sweet, and lovely. It was as sweet as the song of a cuckoo-bird found in the Himalayas. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.36.1">From when he was born, Prince Vipassī had the power of clairvoyance which manifested as a result of past deeds. He could see for a league all around both by day and by night. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.37.1">And he was unblinkingly watchful, like the gods of the Thirty-Three. And because it was said that he was unblinkingly watchful, he came to be known as ‘Vipassī’. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.37.3">Then while King Bandhuma was sitting in judgment, he’d sit Prince Vipassī in his lap and explain the case to him. And sitting there in his father’s lap, Vipassī would thoroughly consider the case and draw a conclusion using a logical procedure. So this was all the more reason for him to be known as ‘Vipassī’. </p>
<p id="dn14:1.38.1">Then King Bandhuma had three stilt longhouses built for him—one for the winter, one for the summer, and one for the rainy season, and provided him with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. Prince Vipassī stayed in a stilt longhouse without coming downstairs for the four months of the rainy season, where he was entertained by musicians—none of them men. </p>
<p class="endsection" id="dn14:1.38.4">The first recitation section. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">5. The Old Man </h3>
<p id="dn14:2.1.1">Then, after many thousand years had passed, Prince Vipassī addressed his charioteer, ‘My dear charioteer, harness the finest chariots. We will go to a park and see the scenery.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.1.3">‘Yes, sir,’ replied the charioteer. He harnessed the chariots and informed the prince, ‘Sire, the finest chariots are harnessed. Please go at your convenience.’ Then Prince Vipassī mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out for the park. </p>
<p id="dn14:2.2.1">Along the way he saw an elderly man, bent double, crooked, leaning on a staff, trembling as he walked, ailing, past his prime. He addressed his charioteer, ‘My dear charioteer, what has that man done? For his hair and his body are unlike those of other men.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.2.5">‘That, Your Majesty, is called an old man.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.2.6">‘But why is he called an old man?’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.2.7">‘He’s called an old man because now he has not long to live.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.2.8">‘But my dear charioteer, am I liable to grow old? Am I not exempt from old age?’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.2.9">‘Everyone is liable to grow old, Your Majesty, including you. No-one is exempt from old age.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.2.10">‘Well then, my dear charioteer, that’s enough of the park for today. Let’s return to the royal compound.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.2.11">‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the charioteer and did so. </p>
<p id="dn14:2.2.12">Back at the royal compound, the prince brooded, miserable and sad: ‘Damn this thing called rebirth, since old age will come to anyone who’s born.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.3.1">Then King Bandhuma summoned the charioteer and said, ‘My dear charioteer, I hope the prince enjoyed himself at the park? I hope he was happy there?’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.3.3">‘No, Your Majesty, the prince didn’t enjoy himself at the park.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.3.4">‘But what did he see on the way to the park?’ And the charioteer told the king about seeing the old man and the prince’s reaction. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">6. The Sick Man </h3>
<p id="dn14:2.4.1">Then King Bandhuma thought, ‘Prince Vipassī must not renounce the throne. He must not go forth from the lay life to homelessness. And the words of the brahmin soothsayers must not come true.’ To this end he provided the prince with even more of the five kinds of sensual stimulation, with which the prince amused himself. </p>
<p id="dn14:2.5.1">Then, after many thousand years had passed, Prince Vipassī had his charioteer drive him to the park once more. </p>
<p id="dn14:2.6.1">Along the way he saw a man who was ill, suffering, gravely ill, collapsed in his own urine and feces, being picked up by some and put down by others. He addressed his charioteer, ‘My dear charioteer, what has that man done? For his eyes and his voice are unlike those of other men.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.6.5">‘That, Your Majesty, is called a sick man.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.6.6">‘But why is he called a sick man?’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.6.7">‘He’s called an sick man; hopefully he will recover from that illness.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.6.8">‘But my dear charioteer, am I liable to fall sick? Am I not exempt from sickness?’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.6.9">‘Everyone is liable to fall sick, Your Majesty, including you. No-one is exempt from sickness.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.6.10">‘Well then, my dear charioteer, that’s enough of the park for today. Let’s return to the royal compound.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.6.11">‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the charioteer and did so. </p>
<p id="dn14:2.6.12">Back at the royal compound, the prince brooded, miserable and sad: ‘Damn this thing called rebirth, since old age and sickness will come to anyone who’s born.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.7.1">Then King Bandhuma summoned the charioteer and said, ‘My dear charioteer, I hope the prince enjoyed himself at the park? I hope he was happy there?’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.7.3">‘No, Your Majesty, the prince didn’t enjoy himself at the park.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.7.4">‘But what did he see on the way to the park?’ And the charioteer told the king about seeing the sick man and the prince’s reaction. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">7. The Dead Man </h3>
<p id="dn14:2.8.1">Then King Bandhuma thought, ‘Prince Vipassī must not renounce the throne. He must not go forth from the lay life to homelessness. And the words of the brahmin soothsayers must not come true.’ To this end he provided the prince with even more of the five kinds of sensual stimulation, with which the prince amused himself. </p>
<p id="dn14:2.9.2">Then, after many thousand years had passed, Prince Vipassī had his charioteer drive him to the park once more. </p>
<p id="dn14:2.10.1">Along the way he saw a large crowd gathered making a bier out of garments of different colors. He addressed his charioteer, ‘My dear charioteer, why is that crowd making a bier?’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.10.4">‘That, Your Majesty, is for someone who’s departed.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.10.5">‘Well then, drive the chariot up to the departed.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.10.6">‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the charioteer, and did so. </p>
<p id="dn14:2.10.7">When the prince saw the corpse of the departed, he addressed the charioteer, ‘But why is he called departed?’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.10.9">‘He’s called departed because now his mother and father, his relatives and kin shall see him no more, and he shall never again see them.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.10.10">‘But my dear charioteer, am I liable to die? Am I not exempt from death? Will the king and queen and my other relatives and kin see me no more? And shall I never again see them?’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.10.13">‘Everyone is liable to die, Your Majesty, including you. No-one is exempt from death. The king and queen and your other relatives and kin shall see you no more, and you shall never again see them.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.10.16">‘Well then, my dear charioteer, that’s enough of the park for today. Let’s return to the royal compound.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.10.17">‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the charioteer and did so. </p>
<p id="dn14:2.10.18">Back at the royal compound, the prince brooded, miserable and sad: ‘Damn this thing called rebirth, since old age, sickness, and death will come to anyone who’s born.’ </p>

<h3 class="subheading">8. The Renunciate </h3>
<p id="dn14:2.12.1">Then King Bandhuma thought, ‘Prince Vipassī must not renounce the throne. He must not go forth from the lay life to homelessness. And the words of the brahmin soothsayers must not come true.’ To this end he provided the prince with even more of the five kinds of sensual stimulation, with which the prince amused himself. </p>
<p id="dn14:2.13.2">Then, after many thousand years had passed, Prince Vipassī had his charioteer drive him to the park once more. </p>
<p id="dn14:2.14.1">Along the way he saw a man, a renunciate with shaven head, wearing an ocher robe. He addressed his charioteer, ‘My dear charioteer, what has that man done? For his head and his clothes are unlike those of other men.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.14.5">‘That, Your Majesty, is called a renunciate.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.14.6">‘But why is he called a renunciate?’ </p>

<p id="dn14:2.14.8">‘Then I celebrate the one called a renunciate, who celebrates principled and fair conduct, skillful actions, good deeds, harmlessness, and compassion for living creatures! Well then, drive the chariot up to that renunciate.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.14.10">‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the charioteer, and did so. </p>
<p id="dn14:2.14.11">Then Prince Vipassī said to that renunciate, ‘My good man, what have you done? For your head and your clothes are unlike those of other men.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.14.14">‘Sire, I am what is called a renunciate.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.14.15">‘But why are you called a renunciate?’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.14.16">‘I am called a renunciate because I celebrate principled and fair conduct, skillful actions, good deeds, harmlessness, and compassion for living creatures.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.14.17">‘Then I celebrate the one called a renunciate, who celebrates principled and fair conduct, skillful actions, good deeds, harmlessness, and compassion for living creatures!’ </p>
<h3 class="subheading">9. The Going Forth </h3>
<p id="dn14:2.15.1">Then the prince addressed the charioteer, ‘Well then, my dear charioteer, take the chariot and return to the royal compound. I shall shave off my hair and beard right here, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.15.4">‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the charioteer and did so. </p>
<p id="dn14:2.15.5">Then Prince Vipassī shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">10. A Great Crowd Goes Forth </h3>
<p id="dn14:2.16.1">A large crowd of 84,000 people in the capital of Bandhumatī heard that Vipassī had gone forth. It occurred to them, ‘This must be no ordinary teaching and training, no ordinary going forth in which Prince Vipassī has gone forth. If even the prince goes forth, why don’t we do the same?’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.16.6">Then that great crowd of 84,000 people shaved off their hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and followed the one intent on awakening, Vipassī, by going forth from the lay life to homelessness. Escorted by that assembly, Vipassī wandered on tour among the villages, towns, and capital cities. </p>
<p id="dn14:2.17.1">Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, ‘It’s not appropriate for me to live in a crowd. Why don’t I live alone, withdrawn from the group?’ After some time he withdrew from the group to live alone. The 84,000 went one way, but Vipassī went another. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">11. Vipassī’s Reflections </h3>
<p id="dn14:2.18.1">Then as Vipassī, the one intent on awakening, was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, ‘Alas, this world has fallen into trouble. It’s born, grows old, dies, passes away, and is reborn, yet it doesn’t understand how to escape from this suffering, from old age and death. Oh, when will an escape be found from this suffering, from old age and death?’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.18.4">Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what exists is there old age and death? What is a condition for old age and death?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, ‘When rebirth exists there’s old age and death. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.18.8">Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what exists is there rebirth? What is a condition for rebirth?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, ‘When continued existence exists there’s rebirth. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.18.12">Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what exists is there continued existence? What is a condition for continued existence?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, ‘When grasping exists there’s continued existence. Grasping is a condition for continued existence.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.18.16">Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what exists is there grasping? What is a condition for grasping?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, ‘When craving exists there’s grasping. Craving is a condition for grasping.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.18.20">Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what exists is there craving? What is a condition for craving?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, ‘When feeling exists there’s craving. Feeling is a condition for craving.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.18.24">Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what exists is there feeling? What is a condition for feeling?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, ‘When contact exists there’s feeling. Contact is a condition for feeling.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.18.28">Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what exists is there contact? What is a condition for contact?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, ‘When the six sense fields exist there’s contact. The six sense fields are a condition for contact.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.18.32">Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what exists are there the six sense fields? What is a condition for the six sense fields?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, ‘When name and form exist there are the six sense fields. Name and form are a condition for the six sense fields.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.18.36">Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what exists are there name and form? What is a condition for name and form?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, ‘When consciousness exists there are name and form. Consciousness is a condition for name and form.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.18.40">Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what exists is there consciousness? What is a condition for consciousness?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, ‘When name and form exist there’s consciousness. Name and form are a condition for consciousness.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.19.1">Then Vipassī thought, ‘This consciousness turns back from name and form, and doesn’t go beyond that.’ It is to this extent that one may be reborn, grow old, die, pass away, or reappear. That is: Name and form are conditions for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.19.6">‘Origination, origination.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in Vipassī, the one intent on awakening, regarding teachings not learned before from another. </p>
<p id="dn14:2.20.1">Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no old age and death? When what ceases do old age and death cease?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, ‘When rebirth doesn’t exist there’s no old age and death. When rebirth ceases, old age and death cease.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.20.5">Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no rebirth? When what ceases does rebirth cease?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, ‘When continued existence doesn’t exist there’s no rebirth. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.20.9">Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no continued existence? When what ceases does continued existence cease?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, ‘When grasping doesn’t exist there’s no continued existence. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.20.13">Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no grasping? When what ceases does grasping cease?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, ‘When craving doesn’t exist there’s no grasping. When craving ceases, grasping ceases.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.20.17">Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no craving? When what ceases does craving cease?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, ‘When feeling doesn’t exist there’s no craving. When feeling ceases, craving ceases.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.20.21">Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no feeling? When what ceases does feeling cease?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, ‘When contact doesn’t exist there’s no feeling. When contact ceases, feeling ceases.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.20.25">Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no contact? When what ceases does contact cease?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, ‘When the six sense fields don’t exist there’s no contact. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.20.29">Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what doesn’t exist are there no six sense fields? When what ceases do the six sense fields cease?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, ‘When name and form don’t exist there are no six sense fields. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.20.33">Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what doesn’t exist are there no name and form? When what ceases do name and form cease?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, ‘When consciousness doesn’t exist there are no name and form. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.20.37">Then Vipassī thought, ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no consciousness? When what ceases does consciousness cease?’ Then, through proper attention, Vipassī comprehended with wisdom, ‘When name and form don’t exist there’s no consciousness. When name and form cease, consciousness ceases.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.21.1">Then Vipassī thought, ‘I have discovered the path to awakening. That is: When name and form cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:2.21.5">‘Cessation, cessation.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in Vipassī, the one intent on awakening, regarding teachings not learned before from another. </p>
<p id="dn14:2.22.1">Some time later Vipassī meditated observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates. ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling. Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is the ending of perception. Such are choices, such is the origin of choices, such is the ending of choices. Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ Meditating like this his mind was soon freed from defilements by not grasping. </p>
<p class="endsection" id="dn14:2.22.8">The second recitation section. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">12. The Appeal of Brahmā </h3>
<p id="dn14:3.1.1">Then the Blessed One Vipassī, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, thought, ‘Why don’t I teach the Dhamma?’ </p>
<p id="dn14:3.1.3">Then he thought, ‘This principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute. But people like attachment, they love it and enjoy it. It’s hard for them to see this thing; that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination. It’s also hard for them to see this thing; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment. And if I were to teach the Dhamma, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:3.2.1">And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to him: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn14:3.2.2">‘I’ve struggled hard to realize this, <br/>enough with trying to explain it! <br/>This teaching is not easily understood <br/>by those mired in greed and hate. </p>
<p id="dn14:3.2.6">Those besotted by greed can’t see <br/>what’s subtle, going against the stream, <br/>deep, hard to see, and very fine, <br/>for they’re veiled in a mass of darkness.’ </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn14:3.2.10">So, as the Buddha Vipassī reflected like this, his mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma. </p>
<p id="dn14:3.2.11">Then a certain Great Brahmā, knowing what the Buddha Vipassī was thinking, thought, ‘Oh my goodness! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the mind of the Blessed One Vipassī, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.’ Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha Vipassī. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha Vipassī, and said, ‘Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma! There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching. There will be those who understand the teaching!’ </p>
<p id="dn14:3.4.1">When he said this, the Buddha Vipassī said to him, ‘I too thought this, Brahmā, “Why don’t I teach the Dhamma?” Then it occurred to me, “If I were to teach the Dhamma, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.” </p>
<p id="dn14:3.4.19">So, as I reflected like this, my mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:3.5.1">For a second time, and a third time that Great Brahmā begged the Buddha to teach. </p>
<p id="dn14:3.6.1">Then, understanding Brahmā’s invitation, the Buddha Vipassī surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, because of his compassion for sentient beings. And he saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not. It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the water’s surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them. </p>
<p id="dn14:3.6.4">In the same way, the Buddha Vipassī saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes. </p>
<p id="dn14:3.7.1">Then that Great Brahmā, knowing what the Buddha Vipassī was thinking, addressed him in verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn14:3.7.2">‘Standing high on a rocky mountain, <br/>you can see the people all around. <br/>In just the same way, all-seer, wise one, <br/>having ascended the Temple of Truth, <br/>rid of sorrow, look upon the people <br/>swamped with sorrow, <j>oppressed by rebirth and old age. </j></p>
<p id="dn14:3.7.8">Rise, hero! Victor in battle, leader of the caravan, <br/>wander the world without obligation. <br/>Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! <br/>There will be those who understand!’ </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn14:3.7.12">Then the Buddha Vipassī addressed that Great Brahmā in verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn14:3.7.13">‘Flung open are the doors to the deathless! <br/>Let those with ears to hear commit to faith. <br/>Thinking it would be troublesome, Brahmā, <j>I did not teach </j><br/>the sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among humans.’ </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn14:3.7.17">Then the Great Brahmā, knowing that his request for the Buddha Vipassī to teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled him, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">13. The Chief Disciples </h3>
<p id="dn14:3.8.1">Then the Blessed One Vipassī, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, thought, ‘Who should I teach first of all? Who will quickly understand this teaching?’ Then he thought, ‘That Khaṇḍa, the king’s son, and Tissa, the high priest’s son, are astute, competent, clever, and have long had little dust in their eyes. Why don’t I teach them first of all? They will quickly understand this teaching.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:3.9.1">Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the tree of awakening and reappeared near the capital city of Bandhumatī, in the deer park named Sanctuary. </p>
<p id="dn14:3.9.2">Then the Buddha Vipassī addressed the park keeper, ‘My dear park keeper, please enter the city and say this to the king’s son Khaṇḍa and the high priest’s son Tissa: “Sirs, the Blessed One Vipassī, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, has arrived at Bandhumatī and is staying in the deer park named Sanctuary. He wishes to see you.”’ </p>
<p id="dn14:3.9.5">‘Yes, sir,’ replied the park keeper, and did as he was asked. </p>
<p id="dn14:3.10.1">Then the king’s son Khaṇḍa and the high priest’s son Tissa had the finest carriages harnessed. Then they mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out from Bandhumatī for the Sanctuary. They went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the Buddha Vipassī on foot. They bowed and sat down to one side. </p>
<p id="dn14:3.11.1">The Buddha Vipassī taught them step by step, with a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation. And when he knew that their minds were ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in the king’s son Khaṇḍa and the high priest’s son Tissa: ‘Everything that has a beginning has an end.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:3.12.1">They saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. They went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. They said to the Buddha Vipassī, ‘Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. We go for refuge to the Blessed One and to the teaching. Sir, may we receive the going forth and ordination in the Buddha’s presence?’ </p>
<p id="dn14:3.13.1">And they received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha Vipassī’s presence. Then the Buddha Vipassī educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk. He explained the drawbacks of conditioned phenomena, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of extinguishment. Being taught like this their minds were soon freed from defilements by not grasping. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">14. The Going Forth of the Large Crowd </h3>
<p id="dn14:3.14.1">A large crowd of 84,000 people in the capital of Bandhumatī heard that the Blessed One Vipassī, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, had arrived at Bandhumatī and was staying in the deer park named Sanctuary. And they heard that the king’s son Khaṇḍa and the high priest’s son Tissa had shaved off their hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the Buddha’s presence. It occurred to them, ‘This must be no ordinary teaching and training, no ordinary going forth in which the king’s son Khaṇḍa and the high priest’s son Tissa have gone forth. If even they go forth, why don’t we do the same?’ Then those 84,000 people left Bandhumatī for the deer park named Sanctuary, where they approached the Buddha Vipassī, bowed and sat down to one side. </p>
<p id="dn14:3.15.1">The Buddha Vipassī taught them step by step, with a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation. And when he knew that their minds were ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in those 84,000 people: ‘Everything that has a beginning has an end.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:3.16.1">They saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. They went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. They said to the Buddha Vipassī, ‘Excellent, sir! Excellent!’ And just like Khaṇḍa and Tissa they asked for and received ordination. Then the Buddha taught them further. </p>
<p id="dn14:3.17.1">Being taught like this their minds were soon freed from defilements by not grasping. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">15. The 84,000 Who Had Gone Forth Previously </h3>
<p id="dn14:3.18.1">The 84,000 people who had gone forth previously also heard: ‘It seems the Blessed One Vipassī, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, has arrived at Bandhumatī and is staying in the deer park named Sanctuary. And he is teaching the Dhamma!’ Then they too went to see the Buddha Vipassī, realized the Dhamma, went forth, and became freed from defilements. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">16. The Allowance to Wander </h3>
<p id="dn14:3.22.1">Now at that time a large Saṅgha of 6,800,000 mendicants were residing at Bandhumatī. As the Buddha Vipassī was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, ‘The Saṅgha residing at Bandhumatī now is large. What if I was to urge them: </p>
<p id="dn14:3.22.4">“Wander forth, mendicants, for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans. Let not two go by one road. Teach the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching. There will be those who understand the teaching! But when six years have passed, you must all come to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code.”’ </p>
<p id="dn14:3.23.1">Then a certain Great Brahmā, knowing what the Buddha Vipassī was thinking, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha Vipassī. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha Vipassī, and said, ‘That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! The Saṅgha residing at Bandhumatī now is large. Please urge them to wander, as you thought. And sir, I’ll make sure that when six years have passed the mendicants will return to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:3.23.10">That’s what that Great Brahmā said. Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha Vipassī, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there. </p>
<p id="dn14:3.24.1">Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha Vipassī came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants, telling them all that had happened. Then he said, </p>
<p id="dn14:3.26.1">‘Wander forth, mendicants, for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans. Let not two go by one road. Teach the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching. There will be those who understand the teaching! But when six years have passed, you must all come to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:3.26.7">Then most of the mendicants departed to wander the country that very day. </p>
<p id="dn14:3.27.1">Now at that time there were 84,000 monasteries in India. And when the first year came to an end the deities raised the cry: ‘Good sirs, the first year has ended. Now five years remain. When five years have passed, you must all go to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:3.27.6">And when the second year … the third year … the fourth year … the fifth year came to an end, the deities raised the cry: ‘Good sirs, the fifth year has ended. Now one year remains. When one year has passed, you must all go to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:3.27.13">And when the sixth year came to an end the deities raised the cry: ‘Good sirs, the sixth year has ended. Now is the time that you must go to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code.’ Then that very day the mendicants went to Bandhumatī to recite the monastic code. Some went by their own psychic power, and some by the psychic power of the deities. </p>
<p id="dn14:3.28.1">And there the Blessed One Vipassī, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, recited the monastic code thus: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn14:3.28.2">‘Patient acceptance is the ultimate austerity. <br/>Extinguishment is the ultimate, say the Buddhas. <br/>No true renunciate injures another, <br/>nor does an ascetic hurt another. </p>
<p id="dn14:3.28.6">Not to do any evil; <br/>to embrace the good; <br/>to purify one’s mind: <br/>this is the instruction of the Buddhas. </p>
<p id="dn14:3.28.10">Not speaking ill nor doing harm; <br/>restraint in the monastic code; <br/>moderation in eating; <br/>staying in remote lodgings; <br/>commitment to the higher mind—<br/>this is the instruction of the Buddhas.’ </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="subheading">17. Being Informed by Deities </h3>
<p id="dn14:3.29.1">At one time, mendicants, I was staying near Ukkaṭṭhā, in the Subhaga Forest at the root of a magnificent sal tree. As I was in private retreat this thought came to mind, ‘It’s not easy to find an abode of sentient beings where I haven’t previously abided in all this long time, except for the gods of the pure abodes. Why don’t I go to see them?’ </p>
<p id="dn14:3.29.5">Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, I vanished from the Subhaga Forest and reappeared with the Aviha gods. </p>
<p id="dn14:3.29.6">In that order of gods, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of deities approached me, bowed, stood to one side, and said to me, ‘Ninety-one eons ago, good sir, the Buddha Vipassī arose in the world, perfected and fully awakened. He was born as an aristocrat into an aristocrat family. Koṇḍañña was his clan. He lived for 80,000 years. He was awakened at the root of a trumpet flower tree. He had a fine pair of chief disciples named Khaṇḍa and Tissa. He had three gatherings of disciples—one of 6,800,000, one of 100,000, and one of 80,000—all of them mendicants who had ended their defilements. He had as chief attendant a mendicant named Asoka. His father was King Bandhuma, his birth mother was Queen Bandhumatī, and their capital city was named Bandhumatī. And such was his renunciation, such his going forth, such his striving, such his awakening, and such his rolling forth of the wheel of Dhamma. And good sir, after leading the spiritual life under that Buddha Vipassī we lost our desire for sensual pleasures and were reborn here.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:3.29.20">And other deities came and similarly recounted the details of the Buddhas Sikhī, Vessabhū, Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa. </p>
<p id="dn14:3.30.1">In that order of gods, many hundreds of deities approached me, bowed, stood to one side, and said to me, ‘In the present fortunate eon, good sir, you have arisen in the world, perfected and fully awakened. You were born as an aristocrat into an aristocrat family. Gotama is your clan. For you the life-span is short, brief, and fleeting. A long-lived person lives for a century or a little more. You were awakened at the root of a peepul tree. You have a fine pair of chief disciples named Sāriputta and Moggallāna. You have had one gathering of disciples—1,250 mendicants who had ended their defilements. You have as chief attendant a mendicant named Ānanda. Your father was King Suddhodana, your birth mother was Queen Māyā, and your capital city was Kapilavatthu. And such was your renunciation, such your going forth, such your striving, such your awakening, and such your rolling forth of the wheel of Dhamma. And good sir, after leading the spiritual life under you we lost our desire for sensual pleasures and were reborn here.’ </p>
<p id="dn14:3.31.1">Then together with the Aviha gods I went to see the Atappa gods … the Gods Fair to See … and the Fair Seeing Gods. Then together with all these gods I went to see the Gods of Akaniṭṭha, where we had a similar conversation. </p>
<p id="dn14:3.33.1">And that is how the Realized One is able to recollect the caste, names, clans, life-span, chief disciples, and gatherings of disciples of the Buddhas of the past who have become completely extinguished, cut off proliferation, cut off the track, finished off the cycle, and transcended suffering. It is both because I have clearly comprehended the principle of the teachings, and also because the deities told me.” </p>
<p id="dn14:3.33.5">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. </p>

<h3 class="subheading">1. Dependent Origination </h3>
<p id="dn15:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma. </p>
<p id="dn15:1.3">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing, in that this dependent origination is deep and appears deep, yet to me it seems as plain as can be.” </p>
<p id="dn15:1.6">“Don’t say that, Ānanda, don’t say that! This dependent origination is deep and appears deep. It is because of not understanding and not penetrating this teaching that this population has become tangled like string, knotted like a ball of thread, and matted like rushes and reeds, and it doesn’t escape the places of loss, the bad places, the underworld, transmigration. </p>
<p id="dn15:2.1">When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for old age and death?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’ If they say, ‘What is a condition for old age and death?’ you should answer, ‘Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’ </p>
<p id="dn15:2.3">When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for rebirth?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’ If they say, ‘What is a condition for rebirth?’ you should answer, ‘Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.’ </p>
<p id="dn15:2.5">When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for continued existence?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’ If they say, ‘What is a condition for continued existence?’ you should answer, ‘Grasping is a condition for continued existence.’ </p>
<p id="dn15:2.7">When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for grasping?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’ If they say, ‘What is a condition for grasping?’ you should answer, ‘Craving is a condition for grasping.’ </p>
<p id="dn15:2.9">When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for craving?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’ If they say, ‘What is a condition for craving?’ you should answer, ‘Feeling is a condition for craving.’ </p>
<p id="dn15:2.11">When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for feeling?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’ If they say, ‘What is a condition for feeling?’ you should answer, ‘Contact is a condition for feeling.’ </p>
<p id="dn15:2.13">When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for contact?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’ If they say, ‘What is a condition for contact?’ you should answer, ‘Name and form are conditions for contact.’ </p>
<p id="dn15:2.15">When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for name and form?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’ If they say, ‘What is a condition for name and form?’ you should answer, ‘Consciousness is a condition for name and form.’ </p>
<p id="dn15:2.17">When asked, ‘Is there a specific condition for consciousness?’ you should answer, ‘There is.’ If they say, ‘What is a condition for consciousness?’ you should answer, ‘Name and form are conditions for consciousness.’ </p>
<p id="dn15:3.1">So: name and form are conditions for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. </p>
<p id="dn15:4.1">‘Rebirth is a condition for old age and death’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. Suppose there were totally and utterly no rebirth for anyone anywhere. That is, there were no rebirth of sentient beings into their various realms—of gods, fairies, spirits, creatures, humans, quadrupeds, birds, or reptiles, each into their own realm. When there’s no rebirth at all, with the cessation of rebirth, would old age and death still be found?” </p>
<p id="dn15:4.4">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:4.5">“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of old age and death, namely rebirth. </p>
<p id="dn15:5.1">‘Continued existence is a condition for rebirth’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. Suppose there were totally and utterly no continued existence for anyone anywhere. That is, continued existence in the sensual realm, the realm of luminous form, or the formless realm. When there’s no continued existence at all, with the cessation of continued existence, would rebirth still be found?” </p>
<p id="dn15:5.4">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:5.5">“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of rebirth, namely continued existence. </p>
<p id="dn15:6.1">‘Grasping is a condition for continued existence’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. Suppose there were totally and utterly no grasping for anyone anywhere. That is, grasping at sensual pleasures, views, precepts and observances, and theories of a self. When there’s no grasping at all, with the cessation of grasping, would continued existence still be found?” </p>
<p id="dn15:6.4">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:6.5">“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of continued existence, namely grasping. </p>
<p id="dn15:7.1">‘Craving is a condition for grasping’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. Suppose there were totally and utterly no craving for anyone anywhere. That is, craving for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts. When there’s no craving at all, with the cessation of craving, would grasping still be found?” </p>
<p id="dn15:7.4">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:7.5">“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of grasping, namely craving. </p>
<p id="dn15:8.1">‘Feeling is a condition for craving’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. Suppose there were totally and utterly no feeling for anyone anywhere. That is, feeling born of contact through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. When there’s no feeling at all, with the cessation of feeling, would craving still be found?” </p>
<p id="dn15:8.4">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:8.5">“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of craving, namely feeling. </p>
<p id="dn15:9.1">So it is, Ānanda, that feeling is a cause of craving. Craving is a cause of seeking. Seeking is a cause of gaining material possessions. Gaining material possessions is a cause of assessing. Assessing is a cause of desire and lust. Desire and lust is a cause of attachment. Attachment is a cause of ownership. Ownership is a cause of stinginess. Stinginess is a cause of safeguarding. Owing to safeguarding, many bad, unskillful things come to be: taking up the rod and the sword, quarrels, arguments, and disputes, accusations, divisive speech, and lies. </p>
<p id="dn15:10.1">‘Owing to safeguarding, many bad, unskillful things come to be: taking up the rod and the sword, quarrels, arguments, and disputes, accusations, divisive speech, and lies’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. Suppose there were totally and utterly no safeguarding for anyone anywhere. When there’s no safeguarding at all, with the cessation of safeguarding, would those many bad, unskillful things still come to be?” </p>
<p id="dn15:10.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:10.4">“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason for the origination of those many bad, unskillful things, namely safeguarding. </p>
<p id="dn15:11.1">‘Stinginess is a cause of safeguarding’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. Suppose there were totally and utterly no stinginess for anyone anywhere. When there’s no stinginess at all, with the cessation of stinginess, would safeguarding still be found?” </p>
<p id="dn15:11.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:11.4">“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of safeguarding, namely stinginess. </p>
<p id="dn15:12.1">‘Ownership is a cause of stinginess’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. Suppose there were totally and utterly no ownership for anyone anywhere. When there’s no ownership at all, with the cessation of ownership, would stinginess still be found?” </p>
<p id="dn15:12.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:12.4">“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of stinginess, namely ownership. </p>
<p id="dn15:13.1">‘Attachment is a cause of ownership’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. Suppose there were totally and utterly no attachment for anyone anywhere. When there’s no attachment at all, with the cessation of attachment, would ownership still be found?” </p>
<p id="dn15:13.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:13.4">“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of ownership, namely attachment. </p>
<p id="dn15:14.1">‘Desire and lust is a cause of attachment’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. Suppose there were totally and utterly no desire and lust for anyone anywhere. When there’s no desire and lust at all, with the cessation of desire and lust, would attachment still be found?” </p>
<p id="dn15:14.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:14.4">“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of attachment, namely desire and lust. </p>
<p id="dn15:15.1">‘Assessing is a cause of desire and lust’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. Suppose there were totally and utterly no assessing for anyone anywhere. When there’s no assessing at all, with the cessation of assessing, would desire and lust still be found?” </p>
<p id="dn15:15.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:15.4">“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of desire and lust, namely assessing. </p>
<p id="dn15:16.1">‘Gaining material possessions is a cause of assessing’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. Suppose there were totally and utterly no gaining of material possessions for anyone anywhere. When there’s no gaining of material possessions at all, with the cessation of gaining material possessions, would assessing still be found?” </p>
<p id="dn15:16.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:16.4">“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of assessing, namely the gaining of material possessions. </p>
<p id="dn15:17.1">‘Seeking is a cause of gaining material possessions’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. Suppose there were totally and utterly no seeking for anyone anywhere. When there’s no seeking at all, with the cessation of seeking, would the gaining of material possessions still be found?” </p>
<p id="dn15:17.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:17.4">“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of gaining material possessions, namely seeking. </p>
<p id="dn15:18.1">‘Craving is a cause of seeking’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. Suppose there were totally and utterly no craving for anyone anywhere. That is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for continued existence, and craving to end existence. When there’s no craving at all, with the cessation of craving, would seeking still be found?” </p>
<p id="dn15:18.4">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:18.5">“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of seeking, namely craving. And so, Ānanda, these two things are united by the two aspects of feeling. </p>
<p id="dn15:19.1">‘Contact is a condition for feeling’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. Suppose there were totally and utterly no contact for anyone anywhere. That is, contact through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. When there’s no contact at all, with the cessation of contact, would feeling still be found?” </p>
<p id="dn15:19.4">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:19.5">“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of feeling, namely contact. </p>
<p id="dn15:20.1">‘Name and form are conditions for contact’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. Suppose there were none of the features, attributes, signs, and details by which the category of mental phenomena is found. Would linguistic contact still be found in the category of physical phenomena?” </p>
<p id="dn15:20.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:20.4">“Suppose there were none of the features, attributes, signs, and details by which the category of physical phenomena is found. Would impingement contact still be found in the category of mental phenomena?” </p>
<p id="dn15:20.5">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:20.6">“Suppose there were none of the features, attributes, signs, and details by which the categories of mental or physical phenomena are found. Would either linguistic contact or impingement contact still be found?” </p>
<p id="dn15:20.7">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:20.8">“Suppose there were none of the features, attributes, signs, and details by which name and form are found. Would contact still be found?” </p>
<p id="dn15:20.9">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:20.10">“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of contact, namely name and form. </p>
<p id="dn15:21.1">‘Consciousness is a condition for name and form’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. If consciousness were not conceived in the mother’s womb, would name and form coagulate there?” </p>
<p id="dn15:21.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:21.4">“If consciousness, after being conceived in the mother’s womb, were to be miscarried, would name and form be born into this state of existence?” </p>
<p id="dn15:21.5">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:21.6">“If the consciousness of a young boy or girl were to be cut off, would name and form achieve growth, increase, and maturity?” </p>
<p id="dn15:21.7">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:21.8">“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of name and form, namely consciousness. </p>
<p id="dn15:22.1">‘Name and form are conditions for consciousness’—that’s what I said. And this is a way to understand how this is so. If consciousness were not to become established in name and form, would the coming to be of the origin of suffering—of rebirth, old age, and death in the future—be found?” </p>
<p id="dn15:22.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:22.4">“That’s why this is the cause, source, origin, and reason of consciousness, namely name and form. This is the extent to which one may be reborn, grow old, die, pass away, or reappear. This is how far the scope of language, terminology, and description extends; how far the sphere of wisdom extends; how far the cycle of rebirths proceeds so that this state of existence is to be found; namely, name and form together with consciousness. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. Describing the Self </h3>
<p id="dn15:23.1">How do those who describe the self describe it? They describe it as physical and limited: ‘My self is physical and limited.’ Or they describe it as physical and infinite: ‘My self is physical and infinite.’ Or they describe it as formless and limited: ‘My self is formless and limited.’ Or they describe it as formless and infinite: ‘My self is formless and infinite.’ </p>
<p id="dn15:24.1">Now, take those who describe the self as physical and limited. They describe the self as physical and limited in the present; or in some future life; or else they think: ‘Though it is not like that, I will ensure it is provided with what it needs to become like that.’ This being so, it’s appropriate to say that a view of self as physical and limited underlies them. </p>
<p id="dn15:24.4">Now, take those who describe the self as physical and infinite … formless and limited … formless and infinite. They describe the self as formless and infinite in the present; or in some future life; or else they think: ‘Though it is not like that, I will ensure it is provided with what it needs to become like that.’ This being so, it’s appropriate to say that a view of self as formless and infinite underlies them. That’s how those who describe the self describe it. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">3. Not Describing the Self </h3>
<p id="dn15:25.1">How do those who don’t describe the self not describe it? They don’t describe it as physical and limited … physical and infinite … formless and limited … formless and infinite: ‘My self is formless and infinite.’ </p>
<p id="dn15:26.1">Now, take those who don’t describe the self as physical and limited … physical and infinite … formless and limited … formless and infinite. They don’t describe the self as formless and infinite in the present; or in some future life; and they don’t think: ‘Though it is not like that, I will ensure it is provided with what it needs to become like that.’ This being so, it’s appropriate to say that a view of self as formless and infinite doesn’t underlie them. That’s how those who don’t describe the self don’t describe it. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">4. Regarding a Self </h3>
<p id="dn15:27.1">How do those who regard the self regard it? They regard feeling as self: ‘Feeling is my self.’ Or they regard it like this: ‘Feeling is definitely not my self. My self does not experience feeling.’ Or they regard it like this: ‘Feeling is definitely not my self. But it’s not that my self does not experience feeling. My self feels, for my self is liable to feel.’ </p>
<p id="dn15:28.1">Now, as to those who say: ‘Feeling is my self.’ You should say this to them: ‘Reverend, there are three feelings: pleasant, painful, and neutral. Which one of these do you regard as self?’ Ānanda, at a time when you feel a pleasant feeling, you don’t feel a painful or neutral feeling; you only feel a pleasant feeling. At a time when you feel a painful feeling, you don’t feel a pleasant or neutral feeling; you only feel a painful feeling. At a time when you feel a neutral feeling, you don’t feel a pleasant or painful feeling; you only feel a neutral feeling. </p>
<p id="dn15:29.1">Pleasant feelings, painful feelings, and neutral feelings are all impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated, liable to end, vanish, fade away, and cease. When feeling a pleasant feeling they think: ‘This is my self.’ When their pleasant feeling ceases they think: ‘My self has disappeared.’ When feeling a painful feeling they think: ‘This is my self.’ When their painful feeling ceases they think: ‘My self has disappeared.’ When feeling a neutral feeling they think: ‘This is my self.’ When their neutral feeling ceases they think: ‘My self has disappeared.’ So those who say ‘feeling is my self’ regard as self that which is evidently impermanent, a mixture of pleasure and pain, and liable to rise and fall. That’s why it’s not acceptable to regard feeling as self. </p>
<p id="dn15:30.1">Now, as to those who say: ‘Feeling is definitely not my self. My self does not experience feeling.’ You should say this to them, ‘But reverend, where there is nothing felt at all, would the thought “I am” occur there?’” </p>
<p id="dn15:30.4">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:30.5">“That’s why it’s not acceptable to regard self as that which does not experience feeling. </p>
<p id="dn15:31.1">Now, as to those who say: ‘Feeling is definitely not my self. But it’s not that my self does not experience feeling. My self feels, for my self is liable to feel.’ You should say this to them, ‘Suppose feelings were to totally and utterly cease without anything left over. When there’s no feeling at all, with the cessation of feeling, would the thought “I am this” occur there?’” </p>
<p id="dn15:31.6">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:31.7">“That’s why it’s not acceptable to regard self as that which is liable to feel. </p>
<p id="dn15:32.1">Not regarding anything in this way, they don’t grasp at anything in the world. Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished. They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ </p>
<p id="dn15:32.5">It wouldn’t be appropriate to say that a mendicant whose mind is freed like this holds the following views: ‘A Realized One exists after death’; ‘A Realized One doesn’t exist after death’; ‘A Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death’; ‘A Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death’. </p>
<p id="dn15:32.10">Why is that? A mendicant is freed by directly knowing this: how far language and the scope of language extend; how far terminology and the scope of terminology extend; how far description and the scope of description extend; how far wisdom and the sphere of wisdom extend; how far the cycle of rebirths and its continuation extend. It wouldn’t be appropriate to say that a mendicant freed by directly knowing this holds the view: ‘There is no such thing as knowing and seeing.’ </p>
<h3 class="subheading">5. Planes of Consciousness </h3>
<p id="dn15:33.1">Ānanda, there are seven planes of consciousness and two dimensions. What seven? </p>
<p id="dn15:33.3">There are sentient beings that are diverse in body and diverse in perception, such as human beings, some gods, and some beings in the underworld. This is the first plane of consciousness. </p>
<p id="dn15:33.5">There are sentient beings that are diverse in body and unified in perception, such as the gods reborn in Brahmā’s Host through the first absorption. This is the second plane of consciousness. </p>
<p id="dn15:33.7">There are sentient beings that are unified in body and diverse in perception, such as the gods of streaming radiance. This is the third plane of consciousness. </p>
<p id="dn15:33.9">There are sentient beings that are unified in body and unified in perception, such as the gods replete with glory. This is the fourth plane of consciousness. </p>
<p id="dn15:33.11">There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond perceptions of form. With the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they have been reborn in the dimension of infinite space. This is the fifth plane of consciousness. </p>
<p id="dn15:33.13">There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of infinite space. Aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they have been reborn in the dimension of infinite consciousness. This is the sixth plane of consciousness. </p>
<p id="dn15:33.15">There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness. Aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they have been reborn in the dimension of nothingness. This is the seventh plane of consciousness. </p>
<p id="dn15:33.17">Then there’s the dimension of non-percipient beings, and secondly, the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. </p>
<p id="dn15:34.1">Now, regarding these seven planes of consciousness and two dimensions, is it appropriate for someone who understands them—and their origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape—to take pleasure in them?” </p>
<p id="dn15:34.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn15:34.10">“When a mendicant, having truly understood the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape regarding these seven planes of consciousness and these two dimensions, is freed by not grasping, they’re called a mendicant who is freed by wisdom. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">6. The Eight Liberations </h3>
<p id="dn15:35.1">Ānanda, there are these eight liberations. What eight? </p>
<p id="dn15:35.3">Having physical form, they see visions. This is the first liberation. </p>
<p id="dn15:35.5">Not perceiving form internally, they see visions externally. This is the second liberation. </p>
<p id="dn15:35.7">They’re focused only on beauty. This is the third liberation. </p>
<p id="dn15:35.9">Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space. This is the fourth liberation. </p>
<p id="dn15:35.11">Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness. This is the fifth liberation. </p>
<p id="dn15:35.13">Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. This is the sixth liberation. </p>
<p id="dn15:35.15">Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, they enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. This is the seventh liberation. </p>
<p id="dn15:35.17">Going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling. This is the eighth liberation. </p>
<p id="dn15:35.19">These are the eight liberations. </p>
<p id="dn15:36.1">When a mendicant enters into and withdraws from these eight liberations—in forward order, in reverse order, and in forward and reverse order—wherever they wish, whenever they wish, and for as long as they wish; and when they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements, they’re called a mendicant who is freed both ways. And, Ānanda, there is no other freedom both ways that is better or finer than this.” </p>
<p id="dn15:36.4">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda was happy with what the Buddha said. </p>

I shall destroy them, and lay ruin and devastation upon them!” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.2.1">And then King Ajātasattu addressed Vassakāra the brahmin minister of Māgadha, “Please, brahmin, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet.

<p id="dn16:1.3.1">“Yes, sir,” Vassakāra replied. He had the finest carriages harnessed. Then he mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out from Rājagaha for the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the Buddha on foot, and exchanged greetings with him. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.3.3">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, “Master Gotama, King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Māgadha bows with his head to your feet. He asks if you are healthy and well, nimble, strong, and living comfortably. Master Gotama, King Ajātasattu wants to invade the Vajjis. He has declared: ‘I shall wipe out these Vajjis, so mighty and powerful! I shall destroy them, and lay ruin and devastation upon them!’” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. Principles That Prevent Decline </h3>
<p id="dn16:1.4.1">Now at that time Venerable Ānanda was standing behind the Buddha fanning him. Then the Buddha said to him, “Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings?” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.4.4">“I have heard that, sir.” </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="dn16:1.4.5">“As long as the Vajjis meet frequently and have many meetings, they can expect growth, not decline. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.4.6">Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis meet in harmony, leave in harmony, and carry on their business in harmony?” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.4.7">“I have heard that, sir.” </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="dn16:1.4.8">“As long as the Vajjis meet in harmony, leave in harmony, and carry on their business in harmony, they can expect growth, not decline. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.4.9">Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis don’t make new decrees or abolish existing decrees, but proceed having undertaken the traditional Vajjian principles as they have been decreed?” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.4.10">“I have heard that, sir.” </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="dn16:1.4.11">“As long as the Vajjis don’t make new decrees or abolish existing decrees, but proceed having undertaken the traditional Vajjian principles as they have been decreed, they can expect growth, not decline. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.4.12">Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate Vajjian elders, and think them worth listening to?” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.4.13">“I have heard that, sir.” </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="dn16:1.4.14">“As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate Vajjian elders, and think them worth listening to, they can expect growth, not decline. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.4.15">Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis don’t rape or abduct women or girls from their families and force them to live with them?” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.4.16">“I have heard that, sir.” </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="dn16:1.4.17">“As long as the Vajjis don’t rape or abduct women or girls from their families and force them to live with them, they can expect growth, not decline. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.4.18">Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajjian shrines, whether inner or outer, not neglecting the proper spirit-offerings that were given and made in the past?” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.4.19">“I have heard that, sir.” </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="dn16:1.4.20">“As long as the Vajjis honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the Vajjian shrines, whether inner or outer, not neglecting the proper spirit-offerings that were given and made in the past, they can expect growth, not decline. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.4.21">Ānanda, have you heard that the Vajjis organize proper protection, shelter, and security for perfected ones, so that more perfected ones might come to the realm and those already here may live in comfort?” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.4.22">“I have heard that, sir.” </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="dn16:1.4.23">“As long as the Vajjis organize proper protection, shelter, and security for perfected ones, so that more perfected ones might come to the realm and those already here may live in comfort, they can expect growth, not decline.” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.5.1">Then the Buddha said to Vassakāra, “Brahmin, this one time I was staying near Vesālī at the Sārandada woodland shrine. There I taught the Vajjis these seven principles that prevent decline. As long as these seven principles that prevent decline last among the Vajjis, and as long as the Vajjis are seen following them, they can expect growth, not decline.” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.5.5">When the Buddha had spoken, Vassakāra said to him, “Master Gotama, if the Vajjis follow even a single one of these principles they can expect growth, not decline. How much more so all seven! King Ajātasattu cannot defeat the Vajjis in war, unless by diplomacy or by sowing dissension. Well, now, Master Gotama, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.5.10">“Please, brahmin, go at your convenience.” Then Vassakāra the brahmin, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got up from his seat and left. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">3. Principles That Prevent Decline Among the Mendicants </h3>
<p id="dn16:1.6.1">Soon after he had left, the Buddha said to Ānanda, “Go, Ānanda, gather all the mendicants staying in the vicinity of Rājagaha together in the assembly hall.” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.6.3">“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He did what the Buddha asked. Then he went back, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, “Sir, the mendicant Saṅgha has assembled. Please, sir, go at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.6.5">Then the Buddha went to the assembly hall, where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, I will teach you these seven principles that prevent decline. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.6.9">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>

<p data-counter="6" id="dn16:1.11.9">As long as the mendicants live according to the view shared with their spiritual companions, both in public and in private—the view that is noble and emancipating, and leads one who practices it to the complete end of suffering—they can expect growth, not decline. </p>

<p id="dn16:1.12.1">And while staying there at the Vulture’s Peak the Buddha often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicants: </p>
<p id="dn16:1.12.2">“Such is ethics, such is immersion, such is wisdom. When immersion is imbued with ethics it’s very fruitful and beneficial. When wisdom is imbued with immersion it’s very fruitful and beneficial. When the mind is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements, namely, the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.13.1">When the Buddha had stayed in Rājagaha as long as he wished, he addressed Venerable Ānanda, “Come, Ānanda, let’s go to Ambalaṭṭhikā.” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.13.3">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Ambalaṭṭhikā, where he stayed in the royal rest-house. And while staying there, too, he often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicants: </p>
<p id="dn16:1.14.3">“Such is ethics, such is immersion, such is wisdom. When immersion is imbued with ethics it’s very fruitful and beneficial. When wisdom is imbued with immersion it’s very fruitful and beneficial. When the mind is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements, namely, the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.” </p>

<p id="dn16:1.15.3">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Nāḷandā, where he stayed in Pāvārika’s mango grove. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">4. Sāriputta’s Lion’s Roar </h3>
<p id="dn16:1.16.1">Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, I have such confidence in the Buddha that I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.16.4">“That’s a grand and dramatic statement, Sāriputta. You’ve roared a definitive, categorical lion’s roar, saying: ‘I have such confidence in the Buddha that I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.’ </p>
<p id="dn16:1.16.7">What about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past? Have you comprehended their minds to know that those Buddhas had such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.16.9">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.16.10">“And what about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future? Have you comprehended their minds to know that those Buddhas will have such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.16.12">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.16.13">“And what about me, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present? Have you comprehended my mind to know that I have such ethics, or such teachings, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.16.15">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.16.16">“Well then, Sāriputta, given that you don’t comprehend the minds of Buddhas past, future, or present, what exactly are you doing, making such a grand and dramatic statement, roaring such a definitive, categorical lion’s roar?” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.17.1">“Sir, though I don’t comprehend the minds of Buddhas past, future, and present, still I understand this by inference from the teaching. Suppose there was a king’s frontier citadel with fortified embankments, ramparts, and arches, and a single gate. And it has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and intelligent. He keeps strangers out and lets known people in. As he walks around the patrol path, he doesn’t see a hole or cleft in the wall, not even one big enough for a cat to slip out. He thinks: ‘Whatever sizable creatures enter or leave the citadel, all of them do so via this gate.’ </p>
<p id="dn16:1.17.8">In the same way, I understand this by inference from the teaching: ‘All the perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas—whether past, future, or present—give up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Their mind is firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They correctly develop the seven awakening factors. And they wake up to the supreme perfect awakening.’” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.18.1">And while staying at Nāḷandā, too, the Buddha often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicants: </p>
<p id="dn16:1.18.2">“Such is ethics, such is immersion, such is wisdom. When immersion is imbued with ethics it’s very fruitful and beneficial. When wisdom is imbued with immersion it’s very fruitful and beneficial. When the mind is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements, namely, the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">5. The Drawbacks of Unethical Conduct </h3>
<p id="dn16:1.19.1">When the Buddha had stayed in Nāḷandā as long as he wished, he addressed Venerable Ānanda, “Come, Ānanda, let’s go to Pāṭali Village.” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.19.3">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Pāṭali Village. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.20.1">The lay followers of Pāṭali Village heard that he had arrived. So they went to see him, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, please consent to come to our guest house.” The Buddha consented in silence. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.21.1">Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, the lay followers of Pāṭali Village got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went to the guest house, where they spread carpets all over, prepared seats, set up a water jar, and placed a lamp. Then they went back to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and told him of their preparations, saying: “Please, sir, come at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.22.1">In the morning, the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the guest house together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Having washed his feet he entered the guest house and sat against the central column facing east. The Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet, entered the guest house, and sat against the west wall facing east, with the Buddha right in front of them. The lay followers of Pāṭali Village also washed their feet, entered the guest house, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the Buddha right in front of them. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.23.1">Then the Buddha addressed them: </p>
<p id="dn16:1.23.2">“Householders, there are these five drawbacks for an unethical person because of their failure in ethics. What five? </p>
<p id="dn16:1.23.4">Firstly, an unethical person loses substantial wealth on account of negligence. This is the first drawback for an unethical person because of their failure in ethics. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.23.6">Furthermore, an unethical person gets a bad reputation. This is the second drawback. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.23.8">Furthermore, an unethical person enters any kind of assembly timid and embarrassed, whether it’s an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics. This is the third drawback. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.23.10">Furthermore, an unethical person feels lost when they die. This is the fourth drawback. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.23.12">Furthermore, an unethical person, when their body breaks up, after death, is reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. This is the fifth drawback. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.23.14">These are the five drawbacks for an unethical person because of their failure in ethics. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">6. The Benefits of Ethical Conduct </h3>
<p id="dn16:1.24.1">There are these five benefits for an ethical person because of their accomplishment in ethics. What five? </p>
<p id="dn16:1.24.3">Firstly, an ethical person gains substantial wealth on account of diligence. This is the first benefit. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.24.5">Furthermore, an ethical person gets a good reputation. This is the second benefit. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.24.7">Furthermore, an ethical person enters any kind of assembly bold and self-assured, whether it’s an assembly of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, or ascetics. This is the third benefit. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.24.9">Furthermore, an ethical person dies not feeling lost. This is the fourth benefit. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.24.11">Furthermore, when an ethical person’s body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. This is the fifth benefit. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.24.13">These are the five benefits for an ethical person because of their accomplishment in ethics.” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.25.1">The Buddha spent most of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the lay followers of Pāṭali Village with a Dhamma talk. Then he dismissed them, “The night is getting late, householders. Please go at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.25.3">“Yes, sir,” replied the lay followers of Pāṭali Village. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving. Soon after they left the Buddha entered a private cubicle. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">7. Building a Citadel </h3>
<p id="dn16:1.26.1">Now at that time the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra were building a citadel at Pāṭali Village to keep the Vajjis out. At that time thousands of deities were taking possession of building sites in Pāṭali Village. Illustrious rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by illustrious deities. Middling rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by middling deities. Lesser rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by lesser deities. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.27.3">With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha saw those deities taking possession of building sites in Pāṭali Village. The Buddha rose at the crack of dawn and addressed Ānanda, “Ānanda, who is building a citadel at Pāṭali Village?” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.27.6">“Sir, the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra are building a citadel to keep the Vajjis out.” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.28.1">“It’s as if they were building the citadel in consultation with the gods of the Thirty-Three. With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw those deities taking possession of building sites. Illustrious rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by illustrious deities. Middling rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by middling deities. Lesser rulers or royal ministers inclined to build houses at sites possessed by lesser deities. As far as the civilized region extends, as far as the trading zone extends, this will be the chief city: the Pāṭaliputta trade center. But Pāṭaliputta will face three threats: from fire, flood, and dissension.” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.29.1">Then the Magadhan ministers Sunidha and Vassakāra approached the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they stood to one side and said, “Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept today’s meal from me?” The Buddha consented in silence. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.30.1">Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, they went to their own guest house, where they had a variety of delicious foods prepared. Then they had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, “It’s time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.30.3">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to their guest house together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Sunidha and Vassakāra served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with their own hands with a variety of delicious foods. When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Sunidha and Vassakāra took a low seat and sat to one side. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.31.1">The Buddha expressed his appreciation with these verses: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn16:1.31.2">“In the place he makes his dwelling, <br/>having fed the astute <br/>and the virtuous here, <br/>the restrained spiritual practitioners, </p>
<p id="dn16:1.31.6">he should dedicate an offering <br/>to the deities there. <br/>Venerated, they venerate him; <br/>honored, they honor him. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.31.10">After that they have compassion for him, <br/>like a mother for the child at her breast. <br/>A man beloved of the deities <br/>always sees nice things.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn16:1.31.14">When the Buddha had expressed his appreciation to Sunidha and Vassakāra with these verses, he got up from his seat and left. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.32.1">Sunidha and Vassakāra followed behind the Buddha, thinking, “The gate through which the ascetic Gotama departs today shall be named the Gotama Gate. The ford at which he crosses the Ganges River shall be named the Gotama Ford.” </p>
<p id="dn16:1.32.4">Then the gate through which the Buddha departed was named the Gotama Gate. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.32.5">Then the Buddha came to the Ganges River. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.33.1">Now at that time the Ganges was full to the brim so a crow could drink from it. Wanting to cross from the near to the far shore, some people were seeking a boat, some a dinghy, while some were tying up a raft. But, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, the Buddha, together with the mendicant Saṅgha, vanished from the near shore and landed on the far shore. </p>
<p id="dn16:1.34.1">He saw all those people wanting to cross over. Knowing the meaning of this, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn16:1.34.3">“Those who cross a deluge or stream <br/>have built a bridge and left the marshes behind. <br/>While some people are still tying a raft, <br/>intelligent people have crossed over.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="endsection" id="dn16:1.34.7">The first recitation section. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">8. Talk on the Noble Truths </h3>
<p id="dn16:2.1.1">Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda, “Come, Ānanda, let’s go to Koṭigāma.” </p>
<p id="dn16:2.1.3">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Koṭigāma, and stayed there. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.2.1">There he addressed the mendicants: </p>
<p id="dn16:2.2.2">“Mendicants, not understanding and not penetrating four noble truths, both you and I have wandered and transmigrated for such a very long time. What four? The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. These noble truths of suffering, origin, cessation, and the path have been understood and comprehended. Craving for continued existence has been cut off; the conduit to rebirth is ended; now there are no more future lives.” </p>
<p id="dn16:2.3.1">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn16:2.3.3">“Because of not truly seeing <br/>the four noble truths, <br/>we have transmigrated for a long time <br/>from one rebirth to the next. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.3.7">But now that these truths have been seen, <br/>the conduit to rebirth is eradicated. <br/>The root of suffering is cut off, <br/>now there are no more future lives.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn16:2.4.1">And while staying at Koṭigāma, too, the Buddha often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicants: </p>
<p id="dn16:2.4.2">“Such is ethics, such is immersion, such is wisdom. When immersion is imbued with ethics it’s very fruitful and beneficial. When wisdom is imbued with immersion it’s very fruitful and beneficial. When the mind is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements, namely, the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">9. The Deaths in Nādika </h3>
<p id="dn16:2.5.1">When the Buddha had stayed in Koṭigāma as long as he wished, he said to Ānanda, “Come, Ānanda, let’s go to Nādika.” </p>
<p id="dn16:2.5.3">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Nādika, where he stayed in the brick house. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.6.1">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, the monk named Sāḷha has passed away in Nādika. Where has he been reborn in his next life? The nun named Nandā, the layman named Sudatta, and the laywoman named Sujātā have passed away in Nādika. Where have they been reborn in the next life? The laymen named Kakkaṭa, Kaḷibha, Nikata, Kaṭissaha, Tuṭṭha, Santuṭṭha, Bhadda, and Subhadda have passed away in Nādika. Where have they been reborn in the next life?” </p>
<p id="dn16:2.7.1">“Ānanda, the monk Sāḷha had realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.7.2">The nun Nandā had ended the five lower fetters. She’s been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.7.3">The layman Sudatta had ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. He’s a once-returner; he will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.7.4">The laywoman Sujātā had ended three fetters. She’s a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.7.5">The laymen Kakkaṭa, Kaḷibha, Nikata, Kaṭissaha, Tuṭṭha, Santuṭṭha, Bhadda, and and Subhadda had ended the five lower fetters. They’ve been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.7.13">Over fifty laymen in Nādika have passed away having ended the five lower fetters. They’ve been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.7.14">More than ninety laymen in Nādika have passed away having ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. They’re once-returners, who will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.7.15">In excess of five hundred laymen in Nādika have passed away having ended three fetters. They’re stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">10. The Mirror of the Teaching </h3>
<p id="dn16:2.8.1">It’s hardly surprising that a human being should pass away. But if you should come and ask me about it each and every time someone passes away, that would be a bother for me. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.8.3">So Ānanda, I will teach you the explanation of the Dhamma called ‘the mirror of the teaching’. A noble disciple who has this may declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’ </p>
<p id="dn16:2.9.1">And what is that mirror of the teaching? </p>
<p id="dn16:2.9.3">It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ </p>
<p id="dn16:2.9.5">They have experiential confidence in the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ </p>
<p id="dn16:2.9.7">They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ </p>
<p id="dn16:2.9.9">And a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.9.10">This is that mirror of the teaching.” </p>
<p id="dn16:2.10.1">And while staying there in Nādika the Buddha often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicants: </p>
<p id="dn16:2.10.2">“Such is ethics, such is immersion, such is wisdom. When immersion is imbued with ethics it’s very fruitful and beneficial. When wisdom is imbued with immersion it’s very fruitful and beneficial. When the mind is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements, namely, the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.” </p>
<p id="dn16:2.11.1">When the Buddha had stayed in Nādika as long as he wished, he addressed Venerable Ānanda, “Come, Ānanda, let’s go to Vesālī.” </p>
<p id="dn16:2.11.3">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Vesālī, where he stayed in Ambapālī’s mango grove. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.12.1">There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: </p>
<p id="dn16:2.12.2">“Mendicants, a mendicant should live mindful and aware. This is my instruction to you. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.12.4">And how is a mendicant mindful? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. That’s how a mendicant is mindful. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.13.1">And how is a mendicant aware? It’s when a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent. That’s how a mendicant is aware. A mendicant should live mindful and aware. This is my instruction to you.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">11. Ambapālī the Courtesan </h3>
<p id="dn16:2.14.1">Ambapālī the courtesan heard that the Buddha had arrived and was staying in her mango grove. She had the finest carriages harnessed. Then she mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out from Vesālī for her own park. She went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the Buddha on foot. She bowed and sat down to one side. The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired her with a Dhamma talk. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.14.5">Then she said to the Buddha, “Sir, may the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me.” The Buddha consented in silence. Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Ambapālī got up from her seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on her right, before leaving. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.15.1">The Licchavis of Vesālī also heard that the Buddha had arrived and was staying in Ambapālī’s mango grove. They had the finest carriages harnessed. Then they mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out from Vesālī. Some of the Licchavis were in blue, of blue color, clad in blue, adorned with blue. And some were similarly colored in yellow, red, or white. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.16.1">Then Ambapālī the courtesan collided with those Licchavi youths, axle to axle, wheel to wheel, yoke to yoke. The Licchavis said to her, “What the hell, Ambapālī, are you doing colliding with us axle to axle, wheel to wheel, yoke to yoke?” </p>
<p id="dn16:2.16.4">“Well, masters, it’s because I’ve invited the Buddha for tomorrow’s meal together with the mendicant Saṅgha.” </p>
<p id="dn16:2.16.5">“Girl, give us that meal for a hundred thousand!” </p>
<p id="dn16:2.16.6">“Masters, even if you were to give me Vesālī with her fiefdoms, I still wouldn’t give that meal to you.” </p>
<p id="dn16:2.16.7">Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers, saying, “We’ve been beaten by the aunty! We’ve been beaten by the aunty!” Then they continued on to Ambapālī’s grove. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.17.1">The Buddha saw them coming off in the distance, and addressed the mendicants: “Any of the mendicants who’ve never seen the gods of the Thirty-Three, just have a look at the assembly of Licchavis. See the assembly of Licchavis, check them out: they’re just like the Thirty-Three!” </p>
<p id="dn16:2.18.1">The Licchavis went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached the Buddha on foot. They bowed to the Buddha, sat down to one side, and the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.18.3">Then they said to the Buddha, “Sir, may the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from us.” </p>
<p id="dn16:2.18.5">Then the Buddha said to the Licchavis, “I have already accepted tomorrow’s meal from Ambapālī the courtesan.” </p>
<p id="dn16:2.18.7">Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers, saying, “We’ve been beaten by the aunty! We’ve been beaten by the aunty!” </p>
<p id="dn16:2.18.9">And then those Licchavis approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.19.1">And when the night had passed Ambapālī had a variety of delicious foods prepared in her own park. Then she had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, “Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.” </p>
<p id="dn16:2.19.3">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of Ambapālī together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Ambapālī served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with her own hands with a variety of delicious foods. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.19.5">When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hands and bowl, Ambapālī took a low seat, sat to one side, and said to the Buddha, “Sir, I present this park to the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha.” </p>
<p id="dn16:2.19.8">The Buddha accepted the park. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.19.9">Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired her with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.20.1">And while staying at Vesālī, too, the Buddha often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicants: </p>
<p id="dn16:2.20.2">“Such is ethics, such is immersion, such is wisdom. When immersion is imbued with ethics it’s very fruitful and beneficial. When wisdom is imbued with immersion it’s very fruitful and beneficial. When the mind is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements, namely, the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">12. Commencing the Rains at Beluva </h3>
<p id="dn16:2.21.1">When the Buddha had stayed in Ambapālī’s grove as long as he wished, he addressed Venerable Ānanda, “Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the little village of Beluva.” </p>
<p id="dn16:2.21.3">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at the little village of Beluva, and stayed there. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.22.1">There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, please enter the rainy season residence with whatever friends or acquaintances you have around Vesālī. I’ll commence the rainy season residence right here in the little village of Beluva.” </p>
<p id="dn16:2.22.4">“Yes, sir,” those mendicants replied. They did as the Buddha said, while the Buddha commenced the rainy season residence right there in the little village of Beluva. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.23.1">After the Buddha had commenced the rainy season residence, he fell severely ill, struck by dreadful pains, close to death. But he endured unbothered, with mindfulness and situational awareness. Then it occurred to the Buddha, “It would not be appropriate for me to become fully extinguished before informing my attendants and taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha. Why don’t I forcefully suppress this illness, stabilize the life force, and live on?” </p>
<p id="dn16:2.24.1">So that is what he did. Then the Buddha’s illness died down. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.24.3">Soon after the Buddha had recovered from that sickness, he came out from his dwelling and sat in the shade of the porch on the seat spread out. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, it’s fantastic that the Buddha is comfortable and well. Because when the Buddha was sick, my body felt like it was drugged. I was disorientated, and the teachings weren’t clear to me. Still, at least I was consoled by the thought that the Buddha won’t become fully extinguished without making some statement regarding the Saṅgha of mendicants.” </p>
<p id="dn16:2.25.1">“But what could the mendicant Saṅgha expect from me, Ānanda? I’ve taught the Dhamma without making any distinction between secret and public teachings. The Realized One doesn’t have the closed fist of a teacher when it comes to the teachings. If there’s anyone who thinks: ‘I’ll take charge of the Saṅgha of mendicants,’ or ‘the Saṅgha of mendicants is meant for me,’ let them make a statement regarding the Saṅgha. But the Realized One doesn’t think like this, so why should he make some statement regarding the Saṅgha? </p>
<p id="dn16:2.25.9">I’m now old, elderly and senior. I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life. I’m currently eighty years old. Just as a decrepit cart keeps going by relying on straps, in the same way, the Realized One’s body keeps going by relying on straps, or so you’d think. Sometimes the Realized One, not focusing on any signs, and with the cessation of certain feelings, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart. Only then does the Realized One’s body become more comfortable. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.26.1">So Ānanda, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge. And how does a mendicant do this? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. That’s how a mendicant is their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how the teaching is their island and their refuge, with no other refuge. </p>
<p id="dn16:2.26.8">Whether now or after I have passed, any who shall live as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the teaching as their island and their refuge, with no other refuge—those mendicants of mine who want to train shall be among the best of the best.” </p>
<p class="endsection" id="dn16:2.26.9">The second recitation section. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">13. An Obvious Hint </h3>
<p id="dn16:3.1.1">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms. Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, get your sitting cloth. Let’s go to the Cāpāla shrine for the day’s meditation.” </p>
<p id="dn16:3.1.5">“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.2.1">Then the Buddha went up to the Cāpāla shrine, where he sat on the seat spread out. Ānanda bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.2.3">The Buddha said to him: “Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, Sārandada, and Cāpāla Tree-shrines are all lovely. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.3.1">Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon. The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.” </p>
<p id="dn16:3.4.1">But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. He didn’t beg the Buddha: “Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.5.1">For a second time … And for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda: “Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, Sārandada, and Cāpāla Tree-shrines are all lovely. Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon, or what’s left of it. The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon, or what’s left of it.” </p>
<p id="dn16:3.5.6">But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. He didn’t beg the Buddha: “Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.6.1">Then the Buddha got up and said to Venerable Ānanda, “Go now, Ānanda, at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="dn16:3.6.4">“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He rose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before sitting at the root of a tree close by. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">14. The Appeal of Māra </h3>
<p id="dn16:3.7.1">And then, not long after Ānanda had left, Māra the Wicked went up to the Buddha, stood to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="dn16:3.7.2">“Sir, may the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have monk disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned, have memorized the teachings, and practice in line with the teachings. Not until they practice properly, living in line with the teaching. Not until they’ve learned their tradition, and explain, teach, assert, establish, disclose, analyze, and make it clear. Not until they can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable basis.’ </p>
<p id="dn16:3.8.1">Today you do have such monk disciples. May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.8.3">Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have nun disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ </p>
<p id="dn16:3.8.5">Today you do have such nun disciples. May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.8.7">Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have layman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ </p>
<p id="dn16:3.8.9">Today you do have such layman disciples. May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.8.11">Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have laywoman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ </p>
<p id="dn16:3.8.13">Today you do have such laywoman disciples. May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.8.15">Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until my spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.’ </p>
<p id="dn16:3.8.17">Today your spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans. May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.” </p>
<p id="dn16:3.9.1">When this was said, the Buddha said to Māra, “Relax, Wicked One. The final extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon. Three months from now the Realized One will finally be extinguished.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">15. Surrendering the Life Force </h3>
<p id="dn16:3.10.1">So at the Cāpāla Tree-shrine the Buddha, mindful and aware, surrendered the life force. When he did so there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky. Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn16:3.10.4">“Weighing up the incomparable <j>against an extension of life, </j><br/>the sage surrendered the life force. <br/>Happy inside, serene, <br/>he burst out of this self-made chain <j>like a suit of armor.” </j></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="subheading">16. The Causes of Earthquakes </h3>
<p id="dn16:3.11.1">Then Venerable Ānanda thought, “How incredible, how amazing! That was a really big earthquake! That was really a very big earthquake; awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky! What’s the cause, what’s the reason for a great earthquake?” </p>
<p id="dn16:3.12.1">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “How incredible, sir, how amazing! That was a really big earthquake! That was really a very big earthquake; awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky! What’s the cause, what’s the reason for a great earthquake?” </p>
<p id="dn16:3.13.1">“Ānanda, there are these eight causes and reasons for a great earthquake. What eight? </p>
<p id="dn16:3.13.3">This great earth is grounded on water, the water is grounded on air, and the air stands in space. At a time when a great wind blows, it stirs the water, and the water stirs the earth. This is the first cause and reason for a great earthquake. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.14.1">Furthermore, there is an ascetic or brahmin with psychic power who has achieved mastery of the mind, or a god who is mighty and powerful. They’ve developed a limited perception of earth and a limitless perception of water. They make the earth shake and rock and tremble. This is the second cause and reason for a great earthquake. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.15.1">Furthermore, when the being intent on awakening passes away from the host of Joyful Gods, he’s conceived in his mother’s belly, mindful and aware. Then the earth shakes and rocks and trembles. This is the third cause and reason for a great earthquake. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.16.1">Furthermore, when the being intent on awakening comes out of his mother’s belly mindful and aware, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles. This is the fourth cause and reason for a great earthquake. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.17.1">Furthermore, when the Realized One realizes the supreme perfect awakening, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles. This is the fifth cause and reason for a great earthquake. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.18.1">Furthermore, when the Realized One rolls forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles. This is the sixth cause and reason for a great earthquake. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.19.1">Furthermore, when the Realized One, mindful and aware, surrenders the life force, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles. This is the seventh cause and reason for a great earthquake. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.20.1">Furthermore, when the Realized One becomes fully extinguished through the element of extinguishment with nothing left over, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles. This is the eighth cause and reason for a great earthquake. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.20.3">These are the eight causes and reasons for a great earthquake. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">17. Eight Assemblies </h3>
<p id="dn16:3.21.1">There are, Ānanda, these eight assemblies. What eight? The assemblies of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics. An assembly of the gods of the Four Great Kings. An assembly of the gods of the Thirty-Three. An assembly of Māras. An assembly of Brahmās. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.22.1">I recall having approached an assembly of hundreds of aristocrats. There I used to sit with them, converse, and engage in discussion. And my appearance and voice became just like theirs. I educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk. But when I spoke they didn’t know: ‘Who is this that speaks? Is it a god or a human?’ And when my Dhamma talk was finished I vanished. But when I vanished they didn’t know: ‘Who was that who vanished? Was it a god or a human?’ </p>
<p id="dn16:3.23.1">I recall having approached an assembly of hundreds of brahmins … householders … ascetics … the gods of the Four Great Kings … the gods of the Thirty-Three … Māras … Brahmās.

But when I vanished they didn’t know: ‘Who was that who vanished? Was it a god or a human?’ </p>
<p id="dn16:3.23.17">These are the eight assemblies. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">18. Eight Dimensions of Mastery </h3>
<p id="dn16:3.24.1">Ānanda, there are these eight dimensions of mastery. What eight? </p>
<p id="dn16:3.25.1">Perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally, limited, both pretty and ugly. Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’ This is the first dimension of mastery. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.26.1">Perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally, limitless, both pretty and ugly. Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’ This is the second dimension of mastery. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.27.1">Not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally, limited, both pretty and ugly. Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’ This is the third dimension of mastery. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.28.1">Not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally, limitless, both pretty and ugly. Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’ This is the fourth dimension of mastery. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.29.1">Not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally that are blue, with blue color, blue hue, and blue tint. They’re like a flax flower that’s blue, with blue color, blue hue, and blue tint. Or a cloth from Benares that’s smoothed on both sides, blue, with blue color, blue hue, and blue tint. In the same way, not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally, blue, with blue color, blue hue, and blue tint. Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’ This is the fifth dimension of mastery. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.30.1">Not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally that are yellow, with yellow color, yellow hue, and yellow tint. They’re like a champak flower that’s yellow, with yellow color, yellow hue, and yellow tint. Or a cloth from Benares that’s smoothed on both sides, yellow, with yellow color, yellow hue, and yellow tint. In the same way, not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally that are yellow, with yellow color, yellow hue, and yellow tint.

<p id="dn16:3.31.1">Not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally that are red, with red color, red hue, and red tint. They’re like a scarlet mallow flower that’s red, with red color, red hue, and red tint. Or a cloth from Benares that’s smoothed on both sides, red, with red color, red hue, and red tint. In the same way, not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally that are red, with red color, red hue, and red tint. Mastering them, they perceive: ‘I know and see.’ This is the seventh dimension of mastery. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.32.1">Not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally that are white, with white color, white hue, and white tint. They’re like the morning star that’s white, with white color, white hue, and white tint. Or a cloth from Benares that’s smoothed on both sides, white, with white color, white hue, and white tint. In the same way, not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally that are white, with white color, white hue, and white tint.

<p id="dn16:3.32.6">These are the eight dimensions of mastery. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">19. The Eight Liberations </h3>
<p id="dn16:3.33.1">Ānanda, there are these eight liberations. What eight? </p>
<p id="dn16:3.33.3">Having physical form, they see visions. This is the first liberation. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.33.5">Not perceiving form internally, they see visions externally. This is the second liberation. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.33.7">They’re focused only on beauty. This is the third liberation. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.33.9">Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space. This is the fourth liberation. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.33.11">Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness. This is the fifth liberation. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.33.13">Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. This is the sixth liberation. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.33.15">Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, they enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. This is the seventh liberation. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.33.17">Going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling. This is the eighth liberation. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.33.19">These are the eight liberations. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.34.1">Ānanda, this one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. Then Māra the wicked approached me, stood to one side, and said: ‘Sir, may the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.’ When he had spoken, I said to Māra: </p>
<p id="dn16:3.35.1">‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have monk disciples … nun disciples … layman disciples … laywoman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.35.5">Not until my spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.’ </p>
<p id="dn16:3.36.1">Today, just now at the Cāpāla shrine Māra the Wicked approached me once more with the same request, reminding me of my former statement, and saying that those conditions had been fulfilled. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.37.1">When he had spoken, I said to Māra: ‘Relax, Wicked One. The final extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon. Three months from now the Realized One will finally be extinguished.’ So today, just now at the Cāpāla Tree-shrine, mindful and aware, I surrendered the life force.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">20. The Appeal of Ānanda </h3>
<p id="dn16:3.38.1">When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, “Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” </p>
<p id="dn16:3.38.3">“Enough now, Ānanda. Do not beg the Realized One. Now is not the time to beg the Realized One.” </p>
<p id="dn16:3.39.1">For a second time … For a third time, Ānanda said to the Buddha, “Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” </p>
<p id="dn16:3.39.4">“Ānanda, do you have faith in the Realized One’s awakening?” </p>
<p id="dn16:3.39.5">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn16:3.39.6">“Then why do you keep pressing me up to the third time?” </p>
<p id="dn16:3.40.1">“Sir, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha: ‘Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon. The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.’” </p>
<p id="dn16:3.40.4">“Do you have faith, Ānanda?” </p>
<p id="dn16:3.40.5">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn16:3.40.6">“Therefore, Ānanda, the misdeed is yours alone, the mistake is yours alone. For even though the Realized One dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign, you didn’t beg me to remain for the eon, or what’s left of it. If you had begged me, I would have refused you twice, but consented on the third time. Therefore, Ānanda, the misdeed is yours alone, the mistake is yours alone. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.41.1">Ānanda, this one time I was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. There I said to you: ‘Ānanda, Rājagaha is lovely, and so is the Vulture’s Peak. Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon. The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.’ But you didn’t get it, even though I dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. You didn’t beg me to remain for the eon, or what’s left of it. If you had begged me, I would have refused you twice, but consented on the third time. Therefore, Ānanda, the misdeed is yours alone, the mistake is yours alone. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.42.1">Ānanda, this one time I was staying right there near Rājagaha, at the Gotama banyan tree … at Bandit’s Cliff … in the Sattapaṇṇi cave on the slopes of Vebhara … at the Black rock on the slopes of Isigili … in the Cool Grove, under the Snake’s Hood Grotto … in the Hot Springs Monastery … in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground … in Jīvaka’s mango grove … in the Maddakucchi deer park … </p>
<p id="dn16:3.43.1">And in each place I said to you: ‘Ānanda, Rājagaha is lovely, and so are all these places. … If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.’ But you didn’t get it, even though I dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. You didn’t beg me to remain for the eon, or what’s left of it. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.45.1">Ānanda, this one time I was staying right here near Vesālī, at the Udena shrine … at the Gotamaka shrine … at the Sattamba shrine … at the Many Sons shrine … at the Sārandada shrine … and just now, today at the Cāpāla shrine. There I said to you: ‘Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, Sārandada, and Cāpāla Tree-shrines are all lovely. Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon. The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.’ But you didn’t get it, even though I dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. You didn’t beg me to remain for the eon, or what’s left of it, saying: ‘Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.’ </p>
<p id="dn16:3.47.7">If you had begged me, I would have refused you twice, but consented on the third time. Therefore, Ānanda, the misdeed is yours alone, the mistake is yours alone. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.48.1">Did I not prepare for this when I explained that we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved? How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out? The Realized One has discarded, eliminated, released, given up, relinquished, and surrendered the life force. He has definitively stated: ‘The final extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon. Three months from now the Realized One will finally be extinguished.’ It’s not possible for the Realized One, for the sake of life, to take back the life force once it has been given up like that. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.48.8">Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the Great Wood, the hall with the peaked roof.” </p>
<p id="dn16:3.48.9">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.49.1">So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the hall with the peaked roof, and said to him, “Go, Ānanda, gather all the mendicants staying in the vicinity of Vesālī together in the assembly hall.” </p>
<p id="dn16:3.49.3">“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He did what the Buddha asked, went up to him, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, “Sir, the mendicant Saṅgha has assembled. Please, sir, go at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="dn16:3.50.1">Then the Buddha went to the assembly hall, where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants: </p>
<p id="dn16:3.50.3">“So, mendicants, having carefully memorized those things I have taught you from my direct knowledge, you should cultivate, develop, and make much of them so that this spiritual practice may last for a long time. That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans. And what are those things I have taught from my direct knowledge? They are: the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.51.1">These are the things I have taught from my direct knowledge. Having carefully memorized them, you should cultivate, develop, and make much of them so that this spiritual practice may last for a long time. That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” </p>
<p id="dn16:3.51.2">Then the Buddha said to the mendicants: </p>
<p id="dn16:3.51.3">“Come now, mendicants, I say to you all: ‘Conditions fall apart. Persist with diligence.’ The final extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon. Three months from now the Realized One will finally be extinguished.” </p>
<p id="dn16:3.51.7">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn16:3.51.9">“I’ve reached a ripe old age, <br/>and little of my life is left. <br/>Having given it up, I’ll depart; <br/>I’ve made a refuge for myself. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.51.13">Diligent and mindful, <br/>be of good virtues, mendicants! <br/>With well-settled thoughts, <br/>take good care of your minds. </p>
<p id="dn16:3.51.17">Whoever meditates diligently <br/>in this teaching and training, <br/>giving up transmigration through rebirths, <br/>will make an end to suffering.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="endsection" id="dn16:3.51.21">The third recitation section. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">21. The Elephant Look </h3>
<p id="dn16:4.1.1">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms. Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he turned his whole body, the way that elephants do, to look back at Vesālī. He said to Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, this will be the last time the Realized One sees Vesālī. Come, Ānanda, let’s go to Bhaṇḍagāma.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.1.5">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.2.1">Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Bhaṇḍagāma, and stayed there. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: </p>
<p id="dn16:4.2.4">“Mendicants, not understanding and not penetrating four things, both you and I have wandered and transmigrated for such a very long time. What four? Noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom. These noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom have been understood and comprehended. Craving for continued existence has been cut off; the conduit to rebirth is ended; now there are no more future lives.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.3.1">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn16:4.3.3">“Ethics, immersion, and wisdom, <br/>and the supreme freedom: <br/>these things have been understood <br/>by Gotama the renowned. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.3.7">And so the Buddha, having insight, <br/>explained this teaching to the mendicants. <br/>The teacher made an end of suffering, <br/>seeing clearly, he is extinguished.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn16:4.4.1">And while staying there, too, he often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicants: </p>
<p id="dn16:4.4.2">“Such is ethics, such is immersion, such is wisdom. When immersion is imbued with ethics it’s very fruitful and beneficial. When wisdom is imbued with immersion it’s very fruitful and beneficial. When the mind is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements, namely, the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">22. The Four Great References </h3>
<p id="dn16:4.5.1">When the Buddha had stayed in Bhaṇḍagāma as long as he wished, he addressed Ānanda, “Come, Ānanda, let’s go to Hatthigāma.”… </p>
<p id="dn16:4.5.3">“Let’s go to Ambagāma.”… </p>
<p id="dn16:4.5.4">“Let’s go to Jambugāma.”… </p>
<p id="dn16:4.5.5">“Let’s go to Bhoganagara.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.6.1">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Bhoganagara, where he stayed at the Ānanda shrine. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.7.2">There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, I will teach you the four great references. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.7.5">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="dn16:4.8.1">“Take a mendicant who says: ‘Reverend, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha: this is the teaching, this is the monastic law, this is the Teacher’s instruction.’ You should neither approve nor dismiss that mendicant’s statement. Instead, you should carefully memorize those words and phrases, then check if they’re included in the discourses or found in the monastic law. If they’re not included in the discourses or found in the monastic law, you should draw the conclusion: ‘Clearly this is not the word of the Buddha. It has been incorrectly memorized by that mendicant.’ And so you should reject it. If they are included in the discourses or found in the monastic law, you should draw the conclusion: ‘Clearly this is the word of the Buddha. It has been correctly memorized by that mendicant.’ You should remember it. This is the first great reference. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="dn16:4.9.1">Take another mendicant who says: ‘In such-and-such monastery lives a Saṅgha with seniors and leaders. I’ve heard and learned this in the presence of that Saṅgha: this is the teaching, this is the monastic law, this is the Teacher’s instruction.’ You should neither approve nor dismiss that mendicant’s statement. Instead, you should carefully memorize those words and phrases, then check if they’re included in the discourses or found in the monastic law. If they’re not included in the discourses or found in the monastic law, you should draw the conclusion: ‘Clearly this is not the word of the Buddha. It has been incorrectly memorized by that Saṅgha.’ And so you should reject it. If they are included in the discourses or found in the monastic law, you should draw the conclusion: ‘Clearly this is the word of the Buddha. It has been correctly memorized by that Saṅgha.’ You should remember it. This is the second great reference. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="dn16:4.10.1">Take another mendicant who says: ‘In such-and-such monastery there are several senior mendicants who are very learned, knowledgeable in the scriptures, who have memorized the teachings, the monastic law, and the outlines. I’ve heard and learned this in the presence of those senior mendicants: this is the teaching, this is the monastic law, this is the Teacher’s instruction.’ You should neither approve nor dismiss that mendicant’s statement. Instead, you should carefully memorize those words and phrases, then check if they’re included in the discourses or found in the monastic law. If they’re not included in the discourses or found in the monastic law, you should draw the conclusion: ‘Clearly this is not the word of the Buddha.

If they are included in the discourses and found in the monastic law, you should draw the conclusion: ‘Clearly this is the word of the Buddha. It has been correctly memorized by those senior mendicants.’ You should remember it. This is the third great reference. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="dn16:4.11.1">Take another mendicant who says: ‘In such-and-such monastery there is a single senior mendicant who is very learned and knowledgeable in the scriptures, who has memorized the teachings, the monastic law, and the outlines. I’ve heard and learned this in the presence of that senior mendicant: this is the teaching, this is the monastic law, this is the Teacher’s instruction.’ You should neither approve nor dismiss that mendicant’s statement.

If they are included in the discourses and found in the monastic law, you should draw the conclusion: ‘Clearly this is the word of the Buddha. It has been correctly memorized by that senior mendicant.’ You should remember it. This is the fourth great reference. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.11.15">These are the four great references. You should remember them.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.12.1">And while staying at the Ānanda shrine, too, the Buddha often gave this Dhamma talk to the mendicants: </p>
<p id="dn16:4.12.2">“Such is ethics, such is immersion, such is wisdom. When immersion is imbued with ethics it’s very fruitful and beneficial. When wisdom is imbued with immersion it’s very fruitful and beneficial. When the mind is imbued with wisdom it is rightly freed from the defilements, namely, the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">23. On Cunda the Smith </h3>
<p id="dn16:4.13.1">When the Buddha had stayed in Bhoganagara as long as he wished, he addressed Ānanda, “Come, Ānanda, let’s go to Pāvā.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.13.3">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants arrived at Pāvā, where he stayed in Cunda the smith’s mango grove. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.14.1">Cunda heard that the Buddha had arrived and was staying in his mango grove. Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk. Then Cunda said to the Buddha, “Sir, may the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me.” The Buddha consented in silence. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.16.1">Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Cunda got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.17.1">And when the night had passed Cunda had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home, and plenty of pork on the turn. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, “Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.18.1">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of Cunda together with the mendicant Saṅgha, where he sat on the seat spread out and addressed Cunda, “Cunda, please serve me with the pork on the turn that you’ve prepared. And serve the mendicant Saṅgha with the other foods.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.18.5">“Yes, sir,” replied Cunda, and did as he was asked. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.19.1">Then the Buddha addressed Cunda, “Cunda, any pork on the turn that’s left over, you should bury it in a pond. I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could properly digest it except for the Realized One.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.19.4">“Yes, sir,” replied Cunda. He did as he was asked, then came back to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.20.1">After the Buddha had eaten Cunda’s meal, he fell severely ill with bloody dysentery, struck by dreadful pains, close to death. But he endured unbothered, with mindfulness and situational awareness. Then he addressed Ānanda, “Come, Ānanda, let’s go to Kusinārā.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.20.5">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn16:4.20.6">I’ve heard that after eating <br/>the meal of Cunda the smith, <br/>the wise one fell severely ill, <br/>with pains, close to death. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.20.10">A severe sickness struck the Teacher <br/>who had eaten the pork on the turn. <br/>While still purging the Buddha said: <br/>“I’ll go to the citadel of Kusinārā.” </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="subheading">24. Bringing a Drink </h3>
<p id="dn16:4.21.1">Then the Buddha left the road and went to the root of a certain tree, where he addressed Ānanda, “Please, Ānanda, fold my outer robe in four and spread it out for me. I am tired and will sit down.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.21.3">“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda, and did as he was asked. The Buddha sat on the seat spread out. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.22.1">When he was seated he said to Venerable Ānanda, “Please, Ānanda, fetch me some water. I am thirsty and will drink.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.22.3">When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, “Sir, just now around five hundred carts have passed by. The shallow water has been churned up by their wheels, and it flows cloudy and murky. The Kakutthā river is not far away, with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful. There the Buddha can drink and cool his limbs.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.23.1">For a second time, the Buddha asked Ānanda for a drink, and for a second time Ānanda suggested going to the Kakutthā river. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.24.1">And for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda, “Please, Ānanda, fetch me some water. I am thirsty and will drink.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.24.3">“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his bowl he went to the river. Now, though the shallow water in that creek had been churned up by wheels, and flowed cloudy and murky, when Ānanda approached it flowed transparent, clear, and unclouded. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.25.1">Then Ānanda thought, “It’s incredible, it’s amazing! The Realized One has such psychic power and might! For though the shallow water in that creek had been churned up by wheels, and flowed cloudy and murky, when I approached it flowed transparent, clear, and unclouded.” Gathering a bowl of drinking water he went back to the Buddha, and said to him, “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! The Realized One has such psychic power and might! Just now, though the shallow water in that creek had been churned up by wheels, and flowed cloudy and murky, when I approached it flowed transparent, clear, and unclouded. Drink the water, Blessed One! Drink the water, Holy One!” So the Buddha drank the water. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">25. On Pukkusa the Malla </h3>
<p id="dn16:4.26.1">Now at that time Pukkusa the Malla, a disciple of Āḷāra Kālāma, was traveling along the road from Kusinārā and Pāvā. He saw the Buddha sitting at the root of a certain tree. He went up to him, bowed, sat down to one side, and said, “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! Those who have gone forth remain in such peaceful meditations. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.27.1">Once it so happened that Āḷāra Kālāma, while traveling along a road, left the road and sat at the root of a nearby tree for the day’s meditation. Then around five hundred carts passed by right next to Āḷāra Kālāma. Then a certain person coming behind those carts went up to Āḷāra Kālāma and said to him: ‘Sir, didn’t you see the five hundred carts pass by?’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.27.5">‘No, friend, I didn’t see them.’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.27.6">‘But sir, didn’t you hear a sound?’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.27.7">‘No, friend, I didn’t hear a sound.’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.27.8">‘But sir, were you asleep?’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.27.9">‘No, friend, I wasn’t asleep.’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.27.10">‘But sir, were you conscious?’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.27.11">‘Yes, friend.’ ‘So, sir, while conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard a sound as five hundred carts passed by right next to you? Why sir, even your outer robe is covered with dust!’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.27.14">‘Yes, friend.’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.27.15">Then that person thought: ‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! Those who have gone forth remain in such peaceful meditations, in that, while conscious and awake he neither saw nor heard a sound as five hundred carts passed by right next to him.’ And after declaring his lofty confidence in Āḷāra Kālāma, he left.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.28.1">“What do you think, Pukkusa? Which is harder and more challenging to do while conscious and awake: to neither see nor hear a sound as five hundred carts pass by right next to you? Or to neither see nor hear a sound as it’s raining and pouring, lightning’s flashing, and thunder’s cracking?” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.29.1">“What do five hundred carts matter, or six hundred, or seven hundred, or eight hundred, or nine hundred, or a thousand, or even a hundred thousand carts? It’s far harder and more challenging to neither see nor hear a sound as it’s raining and pouring, lightning’s flashing, and thunder’s cracking!” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.30.1">“This one time, Pukkusa, I was staying near Ātumā in a threshing-hut. At that time it was raining and pouring, lightning was flashing, and thunder was cracking. And not far from the threshing-hut two farmers who were brothers were killed, as well as four oxen. Then a large crowd came from Ātumā to the place where that happened. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.31.1">Now at that time I came out of the threshing-hut and was walking mindfully in the open near the door of the hut. Then having left that crowd, a certain person approached me, bowed, and stood to one side. I said to them, ‘Why, friend, has this crowd gathered?’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.32.2">‘Just now, sir, it was raining and pouring, lightning was flashing, and thunder was cracking. And two farmers who were brothers were killed, as well as four oxen. Then this crowd gathered here. But sir, where were you?’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.32.5">‘I was right here, friend.’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.32.6">‘But sir, did you see?’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.32.7">‘No, friend, I didn’t see anything.’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.32.8">‘But sir, didn’t you hear a sound?’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.32.9">‘No, friend, I didn’t hear a sound.’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.32.10">‘But sir, were you asleep?’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.32.11">‘No, friend, I wasn’t asleep.’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.32.12">‘But sir, were you conscious?’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.32.13">‘Yes, friend.’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.32.14">‘So, sir, while conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard a sound as it was raining and pouring, lightning was flashing, and thunder was cracking?’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.32.15">‘Yes, friend.’ </p>
<p id="dn16:4.33.1">Then that person thought: ‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! Those who have gone forth remain in such peaceful meditations, in that, while conscious and awake he neither saw nor heard a sound as it was raining and pouring, lightning was flashing, and thunder was cracking.’ And after declaring their lofty confidence in me, they bowed and respectfully circled me, keeping me on their right, before leaving.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.34.1">When he said this, Pukkusa said to him, “Any confidence I had in Āḷāra Kālāma I sweep away as in a strong wind, or float away as down a swift stream. Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.35.1">Then Pukkusa addressed a certain man, “Please, my man, fetch a pair of ready to wear garments the color of rose-gold.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.35.3">“Yes, sir,” replied that man, and did as he was asked. Then Pukkusa brought the garments to the Buddha, “Sir, please accept this pair of ready to wear garments the color of rose-gold from me out of compassion.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.35.6">“Well then, Pukkusa, clothe me in one, and Ānanda in the other.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.35.7">“Yes, sir,” replied Pukkusa, and did so. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.36.1">Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Pukkusa the Malla with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha before leaving. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.37.1">Then, not long after Pukkusa had left, Ānanda placed the pair of garments the color of rose-gold on the Buddha’s body. But when placed on the Buddha’s body they seemed to lose their shine. Then Ānanda said to the Buddha, “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing, how pure and bright is the color of the Realized One’s skin. When this pair of ready to wear garments  the color of rose-gold is placed on the Buddha’s body they seem to lose their lustre.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.37.6">“That’s so true, Ānanda, that’s so true! There are two times when the color of the Realized One’s skin becomes extra pure and bright. What two? The night when a Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening; and the night he becomes fully extinguished through the element of extinguishment with nothing left over. These are the are two times when the color of the Realized One’s skin becomes extra pure and bright. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.38.4">Today, Ānanda, in the last watch of the night, between a pair of sal trees in the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā, shall be the Realized One’s full extinguishment. Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the Kakutthā River.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.38.6">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn16:4.38.7">A pair of garments the color of rose-gold <br/>was presented by Pukkusa; <br/>when the teacher was clothed with them, <br/>his golden skin glowed bright. </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn16:4.39.1">Then the Buddha together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants went to the Kakutthā River. He plunged into the river and bathed and drank. And when he had emerged, he went to the mango grove, where he addressed Venerable Cundaka, “Please, Cundaka, fold my outer robe in four and spread it out for me. I am tired and will lie down.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.40.1">“Yes, sir,” replied Cundaka, and did as he was asked. And then the Buddha laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. But Cundaka sat down right there in front of the Buddha. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn16:4.41.1">Having gone to Kakutthā Creek, <br/>whose water was transparent, sweet, and clear, <br/>the Teacher, being tired, plunged in, <br/>the Realized One, without compare in the world. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.41.5">And after bathing and drinking the Teacher emerged. <br/>Before the group of mendicants, in the middle, <j>the Buddha, </j><br/>the Teacher <j>who rolled forth the present dispensation, </j><br/>the great hermit went to the mango grove. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.41.9">He addressed the mendicant named Cundaka: <br/>“Spread out my folded robe so I can lie down.” <br/>The evolved one urged Cunda, <br/>who quickly spread the folded robe. <br/>The Teacher lay down so tired, <br/>while Cunda sat there before him. </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn16:4.42.1">Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda: </p>
<p id="dn16:4.42.2">“Now it may happen, Ānanda, that others may give rise to some regret for Cunda the smith: ‘It’s your loss, friend Cunda, it’s your misfortune, in that the Realized One became fully extinguished after eating his last almsmeal from you.’ You should dispel remorse in Cunda the smith like this: ‘You’re fortunate, friend Cunda, you’re so very fortunate, in that the Realized One became fully extinguished after eating his last almsmeal from you. I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.42.8">There are two almsmeal offerings that have identical fruit and result, and are more fruitful and beneficial than other almsmeal offerings. What two? The almsmeal after eating which a Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening; and the almsmeal after eating which he becomes fully extinguished through the element of extinguishment with nothing left over. These two almsmeal offerings have identical fruit and result, and are more fruitful and beneficial than other almsmeal offerings. </p>
<p id="dn16:4.42.12">You’ve accumulated a deed that leads to long life, beauty, happiness, fame, heaven, and sovereignty.’ That’s how you should dispel remorse in Cunda the smith.” </p>
<p id="dn16:4.43.1">Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn16:4.43.2">“A giver’s merit grows; <br/>enmity doesn’t build up when you have self-control. <br/>A skillful person gives up bad things—<br/>with the end of greed, hate, and delusion, they’re extinguished.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="endsection" id="dn16:4.43.6">The fourth recitation section. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">26. The Pair of Sal Trees </h3>
<p id="dn16:5.1.1">Then the Buddha said to Ānanda, “Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the far shore of the Golden River, and on to the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.1.3">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. And that’s where they went. Then the Buddha addressed Ānanda, “Please, Ānanda, set up a cot for me between the twin sal trees, with my head to the north. I am tired and will lie down.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.1.6">“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda, and did as he was asked. And then the Buddha laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware. </p>
<p id="dn16:5.2.1">Now at that time the twin sal trees were in full blossom with flowers out of season. They sprinkled and bestrewed the Realized One’s body in honor of the Realized One. And the flowers of the heavenly Flame Tree fell from the sky, and they too sprinkled and bestrewed the Realized One’s body in honor of the Realized One. And heavenly sandalwood powder fell from the sky, and it too sprinkled and bestrewed the Realized One’s body in honor of the Realized One. And heavenly music played in the sky in honor of the Realized One. And heavenly choirs sang in the sky in honor of the Realized One. </p>
<p id="dn16:5.3.1">Then the Buddha pointed out to Ānanda what was happening, adding: “That’s not how the Realized One is honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. Any monk or nun or male or female lay follower who practices in line with the teachings, practicing properly, living in line with the teachings—they honor, respect, revere, venerate, and esteem the Realized One with the highest honor. So Ānanda, you should train like this: ‘We shall practice in line with the teachings, practicing properly, living in line with the teaching.’ </p>
<h3 class="subheading">27. The Monk Upavāṇa </h3>
<p id="dn16:5.4.1">Now at that time Venerable Upavāṇa was standing in front of the Buddha fanning him. Then the Buddha made him move, “Move over, mendicant, don’t stand in front of me.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.4.4">Ānanda thought, “This Venerable Upavāṇa has been the Buddha’s attendant for a long time, close to him, living in his presence. Yet in his final hour the Buddha makes him move, saying: ‘Move over, mendicant, don’t stand in front of me.’ What is the cause, what is the reason for this?” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.5.1">Then Ānanda said to the Buddha, “This Venerable Upavāṇa has been the Buddha’s attendant for a long time, close to him, living in his presence. Yet in his final hour the Buddha makes him move, saying: ‘Move over, mendicant, don’t stand in front of me.’ What is the cause, sir, what is the reason for this?” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.5.7">“Most of the deities from ten solar systems have gathered to see the Realized One. For twelve leagues all around this sal grove there’s no spot, not even a fraction of a hair’s tip, that’s not crowded full of illustrious deities. The deities are complaining: ‘We’ve come such a long way to see the Realized One! Only rarely do Realized Ones arise in the world, perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas. This very day, in the last watch of the night, the Realized One will become fully extinguished. And this illustrious mendicant is standing in front of the Buddha blocking the view. We won’t get to see the Realized One in his final hour!’” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.6.1">“But sir, what kind of deities are you thinking of?” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.6.2">“There are, Ānanda, deities—both in the sky and on the earth—who are percipient of the earth. With hair disheveled and arms raised, they fall down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamenting: ‘Too soon the Blessed One will become fully extinguished! Too soon the Holy One will become fully extinguished! Too soon the seer will vanish from the world!’ </p>
<p id="dn16:5.6.6">But the deities who are free of desire endure, mindful and aware, thinking: ‘Conditions are impermanent. How could it possibly be otherwise?’” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">28. The Four Inspiring Places </h3>
<p id="dn16:5.7.1">“Previously, sir, when mendicants had completed the rainy season residence in various districts they came to see the Realized One. We got to see the esteemed mendicants, and to pay homage to them. But when the Buddha has passed, we won’t get to see the esteemed mendicants or to pay homage to them.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.8.1">“Ānanda, a faithful gentleman should go to see these four inspiring places. What four? Thinking: ‘Here the Realized One was born!’—that is an inspiring place. Thinking: ‘Here the Realized One became awakened as a supreme fully awakened Buddha!’—that is an inspiring place. Thinking: ‘Here the supreme Wheel of Dhamma was rolled forth by the Realized One!’—that is an inspiring place. Thinking: ‘Here the Realized One became fully extinguished through the element of extinguishment with nothing left over!’—that is an inspiring place. These are the four inspiring places that a faithful gentleman should go to see. </p>
<p id="dn16:5.8.8">Faithful monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen will come, and think: ‘Here the Realized One was born!’ and ‘Here the Realized One became awakened as a supreme fully awakened Buddha!’ and ‘Here the supreme Wheel of Dhamma was rolled forth by the Realized One!’ and ‘Here the Realized One became fully extinguished through the element of extinguishment with nothing left over!’ Anyone who passes away while on pilgrimage to these shrines will, when their body breaks up, after death, be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">29. Ānanda’s Questions </h3>
<p id="dn16:5.9.1">“Sir, how do we proceed when it comes to females?” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.9.2">“Without seeing, Ānanda.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.9.3">“But when seeing, how to proceed?” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.9.4">“Without getting into conversation, Ānanda.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.9.5">“But when in a conversation, how to proceed?” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.9.6">“Be mindful, Ānanda.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.10.1">“Sir, how do we proceed when it comes to the Realized One’s corpse?” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.10.2">“Don’t get involved in the rites for venerating the Realized One’s corpse, Ānanda. Please, Ānanda, you must all strive and practice for your own goal! Meditate diligent, keen, and resolute for your own goal! There are astute aristocrats, brahmins, and householders who are devoted to the Realized One. They will perform the rites for venerating the Realized One’s corpse.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.11.1">“But sir, how to proceed when it comes to the Realized One’s corpse?” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.11.2">“Proceed in the same way as they do for the corpse of a wheel-turning monarch.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.11.3">“But how do they proceed with a wheel-turning monarch’s corpse?” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.11.4">“They wrap a wheel-turning monarch’s corpse with unworn cloth, then with uncarded cotton, then again with unworn cloth. In this way they wrap the corpse with five hundred double-layers. Then they place it in an iron case filled with oil and close it up with another case. Then, having built a funeral pyre out of all kinds of fragrant substances, they cremate the corpse. They build a monument for the wheel-turning monarch at the crossroads. That’s how they proceed with a wheel-turning monarch’s corpse. Proceed in the same way with the Realized One’s corpse. A monument for the Realized One is to be built at the crossroads. When someone there lifts up garlands or fragrance or powder, or bows, or inspires confidence in their heart, that will be for their lasting welfare and happiness. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">30. Persons Worthy of Monument </h3>
<p id="dn16:5.12.1">Ānanda, these four are worthy of a monument. What four? A Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha; a Buddha awakened for themselves; a disciple of a Realized One; and a wheel-turning monarch. </p>
<p id="dn16:5.12.4">And for what reason is a Realized One worthy of a monument? So that many people will inspire confidence in their hearts, thinking: ‘This is the monument for that Blessed One, perfected and fully awakened!’ And having done so, when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. It is for this reason that a Realized One is worthy of a monument. </p>
<p id="dn16:5.12.8">And for what reason is a Buddha awakened for themselves worthy of a monument? So that many people will inspire confidence in their hearts, thinking: ‘This is the monument for that Buddha awakened for themselves!’ And having done so, when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. It is for this reason that a Buddha awakened for themselves is worthy of a monument. </p>
<p id="dn16:5.12.12">And for what reason is a Realized One’s disciple worthy of a monument? So that many people will inspire confidence in their hearts, thinking: ‘This is the monument for that Blessed One’s disciple!’ And having done so, when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. It is for this reason that a Realized One’s disciple is worthy of a monument. </p>
<p id="dn16:5.12.16">And for what reason is a wheel-turning monarch worthy of a monument? So that many people will inspire confidence in their hearts, thinking: ‘This is the monument for that just and principled king!’ And having done so, when their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. It is for this reason that a wheel-turning monarch is worthy of a monument. </p>
<p id="dn16:5.12.20">These four are worthy of a monument.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">31. Ānanda’s Incredible Qualities </h3>
<p id="dn16:5.13.1">Then Venerable Ānanda entered a dwelling, and stood there leaning against the door-jamb and crying, “Oh! I’m still only a trainee with work left to do; and my Teacher’s about to become fully extinguished, he who is so kind to me!” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.13.3">Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, “Mendicants, where is Ānanda?” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.13.5">“Sir, Ānanda has entered a dwelling, and stands there leaning against the door-jamb and crying: ‘Oh! I’m still only a trainee with work left to do; and my Teacher’s about to become fully extinguished, he who is so kind to me!’” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.13.7">So the Buddha addressed a certain monk, “Please, monk, in my name tell Ānanda that the teacher summons him.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.13.10">“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Ānanda and said to him, “Reverend Ānanda, the teacher summons you.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.14.1">“Yes, reverend,” Ānanda replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: </p>
<p id="dn16:5.14.2">“Enough, Ānanda! Do not grieve, do not lament. Did I not prepare for this when I explained that we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved? How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out, even the Realized One’s body? For a long time, Ānanda, you’ve treated the Realized One with deeds of body, speech, and mind that are loving, beneficial, pleasant, undivided, and limitless. You have done good deeds, Ānanda. Devote yourself to meditation, and you will soon be free of defilements.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.15.1">Then the Buddha said to the mendicants: </p>
<p id="dn16:5.15.2">“The Buddhas of the past or the future have attendants who are no better than Ānanda is for me. Ānanda is astute, he is intelligent. He knows the time for monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, king’s ministers, religious founders, and the disciples of religious founders to visit the Realized One. </p>
<p id="dn16:5.16.1">There are these four incredible and amazing things about Ānanda. What four? If an assembly of monks goes to see Ānanda, they’re uplifted by seeing him and uplifted by hearing him speak. And when he falls silent, they’ve never had enough. If an assembly of nuns … laymen … or laywomen goes to see Ānanda, they’re uplifted by seeing him and uplifted by hearing him speak. And when he falls silent, they’ve never had enough. These are the four incredible and amazing things about Ānanda. </p>
<p id="dn16:5.16.16">There are these four incredible and amazing things about a wheel-turning monarch. What four? If an assembly of aristocrats goes to see a wheel-turning monarch, they’re uplifted by seeing him and uplifted by hearing him speak. And when he falls silent, they’ve never had enough. If an assembly of brahmins … householders … or ascetics goes to see a wheel-turning monarch, they’re uplifted by seeing him and uplifted by hearing him speak. And when he falls silent, they’ve never had enough. </p>
<p id="dn16:5.16.26">In the same way, there are those four incredible and amazing things about Ānanda.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">32. Teaching the Discourse on Mahāsudassana </h3>
<p id="dn16:5.17.1">When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="dn16:5.17.2">“Sir, please don’t become fully extinguished in this little hamlet, this jungle hamlet, this branch hamlet. There are other great cities such as Campā, Rājagaha, Sāvatthī, Sāketa, Kosambī, and Benares. Let the Buddha become fully extinguished there. There are many well-to-do aristocrats, brahmins, and householders there who are devoted to the Buddha. They will perform the rites of venerating the Realized One’s corpse.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.17.8">“Don’t say that Ānanda! Don’t say that this is a little hamlet, a jungle hamlet, a branch hamlet. </p>
<p id="dn16:5.18.1">Once upon a time there was a king named Mahāsudassana who was a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extended to all four sides, he achieved stability in the country, and he possessed the seven treasures. His capital was this Kusinārā, which at the time was named Kusāvatī. It stretched for twelve leagues from east to west, and seven leagues from north to south. The royal capital of Kusāvatī was successful, prosperous, populous, full of people, with plenty of food. It was just like Āḷakamandā, the royal capital of the gods, which is successful, prosperous, populous, full of spirits, with plenty of food. Kusāvatī was never free of ten sounds by day or night, namely: the sound of elephants, horses, chariots, drums, clay drums, arched harps, singing, horns, gongs, and handbells; and the cry: ‘Eat, drink, be merry!’ as the tenth. </p>
<p id="dn16:5.19.1">Go, Ānanda, into Kusinārā and inform the Mallas: ‘This very day, Vāseṭṭhas, in the last watch of the night, the Realized One will become fully extinguished. Come forth, Vāseṭṭhas! Come forth, Vāseṭṭhas! Don’t regret it later, thinking: ‘The Realized One became fully extinguished in our own village district, but we didn’t get a chance to see him in his final hour.’” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.19.6">“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Then he robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kusinārā with a companion. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">33. The Mallas Pay Homage </h3>
<p id="dn16:5.20.1">Now at that time the Mallas of Kusinārā were sitting together at the meeting hall on some business. Ānanda went up to them, and announced: “This very day, Vāseṭṭhas, in the last watch of the night, the Realized One will become fully extinguished. Come forth, Vāseṭṭhas! Come forth, Vāseṭṭhas! Don’t regret it later, thinking: ‘The Realized One became fully extinguished in our own village district, but we didn’t get a chance to see him in his final hour.’” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.21.1">When they heard what Ānanda had to say, the Mallas, their sons, daughters-in-law, and wives became distraught, saddened, and grief-stricken. And some, with hair disheveled and arms raised, falling down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamented, “Too soon the Blessed One will become fully extinguished! Too soon the Holy One will become fully extinguished! Too soon the seer will vanish from the world!” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.21.3">Then the Mallas, their sons, daughters-in-law, and wives, distraught, saddened, and grief-stricken went to the Mallian sal grove at Upavattana and approached Ānanda. </p>
<p id="dn16:5.22.1">Then Ānanda thought, “If I have the Mallas pay homage to the Buddha one by one, they won’t be finished before first light. I’d better separate them family by family and then have them pay homage, saying: ‘Sir, the Malla named so-and-so with children, wives, retinue, and ministers bows with his head at your feet.’” And so that’s what he did. So by this means Ānanda got the Mallas to finish paying homage to the Buddha in the first watch of the night. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">34. On Subhadda the Wanderer </h3>
<p id="dn16:5.23.1">Now at that time a wanderer named Subhadda was residing near Kusinārā. He heard that on that very day, in the last watch of the night, the ascetic Gotama would become fully extinguished. He thought: “I have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior, the teachers of teachers, said: ‘Only rarely do Realized Ones arise in the world, perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.’ And this very day, in the last watch of the night, the ascetic Gotama will become fully extinguished. This state of uncertainty has come up in me. I am quite confident that the Buddha is capable of teaching me so that I can give up this state of uncertainty.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.24.1">Then Subhadda went to the Mallian sal grove at Upavattana, approached Ānanda, and said to him, “Master Ānanda, I have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior, the teachers of teachers, said: ‘Only rarely do Realized Ones arise in the world, perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas.’ And this very day, in the last watch of the night, the ascetic Gotama will become fully extinguished. This state of uncertainty has come up in me. I am quite confident that the Buddha is capable of teaching me so that I can give up this state of uncertainty. Master Ānanda, please let me see the ascetic Gotama.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.24.8">When he had spoken, Ānanda said, “Enough, Reverend Subhadda, do not trouble the Realized One. He is tired.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.24.10">For a second time, and a third time, Subhadda asked Ānanda, and a third time Ānanda refused. </p>
<p id="dn16:5.25.1">The Buddha heard that discussion between Ānanda and Subhadda. He said to Ānanda, “Enough, Ānanda, don’t obstruct Subhadda; let him see the Realized One. For whatever he asks me, he will only be looking for understanding, not trouble. And he will quickly understand any answer I give to his question.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.25.6">So Ānanda said to the wanderer Subhadda, “Go, Reverend Subhadda, the Buddha is taking the time for you.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.26.1">Then the wanderer Subhadda went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="dn16:5.26.2">“Master Gotama, there are those ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a community, and teach a community. They’re well-known and famous religious founders, regarded as holy by many people. Namely: Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, Pakudha Kaccāyana, and Ajita Kesakambala. According to their own claims, did all of them have direct knowledge, or none of them, or only some?” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.26.5">“Enough, Subhadda, let that be. I shall teach you the Dhamma. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.26.9">“Yes, sir,” Subhadda replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="dn16:5.27.1">“Subhadda, in whatever teaching and training the noble eightfold path is not found, there is no true ascetic found, no second ascetic, no third ascetic, and no fourth ascetic. In whatever teaching and training the noble eightfold path is found, there is a true ascetic found, a second ascetic, a third ascetic, and a fourth ascetic. In this teaching and training the noble eightfold path is found. Only here is there a true ascetic, here a second ascetic, here a third ascetic, and here a fourth ascetic. Other sects are empty of ascetics. </p>
<p id="dn16:5.27.4">Were these mendicants to practice well, the world would not be empty of perfected ones. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn16:5.27.5">I was twenty-nine years of age, Subaddha, <br/>when I went forth to discover what is skillful. <br/>It’s been over fifty years <br/>since I went forth. <br/>I am the one who points out the proper teaching: <br/>Outside of here there is no true ascetic. </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn16:5.27.11">Were these mendicants to practice well, the world would not be empty of perfected ones.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.28.1">When he had spoken, Subhadda said to the Buddha, “Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.29.1">“Subhadda, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation. When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood. However, I have recognized individual differences in this matter.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.29.3">“Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.29.4">Then the Buddha said to Ānanda, “Well then, Ānanda, give Subhadda the going forth.” </p>
<p id="dn16:5.29.6">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. </p>
<p id="dn16:5.30.1">Then Subhadda said to Ānanda, “You’re so fortunate, Reverand Ānanda, so very fortunate, to be anointed here in the Teacher’s presence as his pupil!” And the wanderer Subhadda received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. Not long after his ordination, Venerable Subhadda, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="dn16:5.30.6">He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable Subhadda became one of the perfected. He was the last personal disciple of the Buddha. </p>
<p class="endsection" id="dn16:5.30.9">The fifth recitation section. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">35. The Buddha’s Last Words </h3>
<p id="dn16:6.1.1">Then the Buddha addressed Venerable Ānanda: </p>
<p id="dn16:6.1.2">“Now, Ānanda, some of you might think: ‘The teacher’s dispensation has passed. Now we have no Teacher.’ But you should not see it like this. The teaching and training that I have taught and pointed out for you shall be your Teacher after my passing. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.2.1">After my passing, mendicants ought not address each other as ‘reverend’, as they do today. A more senior mendicant ought to address a more junior mendicant by name or clan, or by saying ‘reverend’. A more junior mendicant ought to address a more senior mendicant using ‘sir’ or ‘venerable’. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.3.1">If it wishes, after my passing the Saṅgha may abolish the lesser and minor training rules. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.4.1">After my passing, give the prime punishment to the mendicant Channa.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.4.2">“But sir, what is the prime punishment?” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.4.3">“Channa may say what he likes, but the mendicants should not advise or instruct him.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.5.1">Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, “Perhaps even a single mendicant has doubt or uncertainty regarding the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the path, or the practice. So ask, mendicants! Don’t regret it later, thinking: ‘We were in the Teacher’s presence and we weren’t able to ask the Buddha a question.’” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.5.4">When this was said, the mendicants kept silent. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.6.1">For a second time, and a third time the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Perhaps even a single mendicant has doubt or uncertainty regarding the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the path, or the practice. So ask, mendicants! Don’t regret it later, thinking: ‘We were in the Teacher’s presence and we weren’t able to ask the Buddha a question.’” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.6.5">For a third time, the mendicants kept silent. Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, </p>
<p id="dn16:6.6.7">“Mendicants, perhaps you don’t ask out of respect for the Teacher. So let a friend tell a friend.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.6.8">When this was said, the mendicants kept silent. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.6.9">Then Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! I am quite confident that there’s not even a single mendicant in this Saṅgha who has doubt or uncertainty regarding the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the path, or the practice.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.6.11">“Ānanda, you speak from faith. But the Realized One knows that there’s not even a single mendicant in this Saṅgha who has doubt or uncertainty regarding the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the path, or the practice. Even the last of these five hundred mendicants is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.7.1">Then the Buddha said to the mendicants: “Come now, mendicants, I say to you all: ‘Conditions fall apart. Persist with diligence.’” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.7.4">These were the Realized One’s last words. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">36. The Full Extinguishment </h3>
<p id="dn16:6.8.1">Then the Buddha entered the first absorption. Emerging from that, he entered the second absorption. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the third absorption, the fourth absorption, the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness, and the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Then he entered the cessation of perception and feeling. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.8.2">Then Venerable Ānanda said to Venerable Anuruddha, “Venerable Anuruddha, has the Buddha become fully extinguished?” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.8.4">“No, Reverend Ānanda. He has entered the cessation of perception and feeling.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.9.1">Then the Buddha emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling and entered the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the dimension of nothingness, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of infinite space, the fourth absorption, the third absorption, the second absorption, and the first absorption. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the second absorption and the third absorption. Then he entered the fourth absorption. Emerging from that the Buddha immediately became fully extinguished. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.10.1">When the Buddha became fully extinguished, along with the full extinguishment there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky. When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Brahmā Sahampati recited this verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn16:6.10.3">“All creatures in this world <br/>must lay down this bag of bones. <br/>For even a Teacher such as this, <br/>unrivaled in the world, <br/>the Realized One, attained to power, <br/>the Buddha became fully extinguished.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn16:6.10.9">When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Sakka, lord of gods, recited this verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn16:6.10.10">“Oh! Conditions are impermanent, <br/>their nature is to rise and fall; <br/>having arisen, they cease; <br/>their stilling is true bliss.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn16:6.10.14">When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Venerable Anuruddha recited this verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn16:6.10.15">“There was no more breathing <br/>for the poised one of steady heart. <br/>Imperturbable, committed to peace, <br/>the sage has done his time. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.10.19">He put up with painful feelings <br/>without flinching. <br/>The liberation of his heart <br/>was like the extinguishing of a lamp.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn16:6.10.23">When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Venerable Ānanda recited this verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn16:6.10.24">“Then there was terror! <br/>Then they had goosebumps! <br/>When the Buddha, endowed with all fine qualities, <br/>became fully extinguished.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn16:6.10.28">When the Buddha became fully extinguished, some of the mendicants there, with arms raised, falling down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamented: “Too soon the Blessed One has become fully extinguished! Too soon the Holy One has become fully extinguished! Too soon the seer has vanished from the world!” But the mendicants who were free of desire endured, mindful and aware, thinking, “Conditions are impermanent. How could it possibly be otherwise?” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.11.1">Then Anuruddha addressed the mendicants: “Enough, reverends, do not grieve or lament. Did the Buddha not prepare us for this when he explained that we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved? How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out? The deities are complaining.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.11.7">“But sir, what kind of deities are you thinking of?” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.11.8">“There are, Ānanda, deities—both in the sky and on the earth—who are percipient of the earth. With hair disheveled and arms raised, they fall down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamenting: ‘Too soon the Blessed One has become fully extinguished! Too soon the Holy One has become fully extinguished! Too soon the seer has vanished from the world!’ But the deities who are free of desire endure, mindful and aware, thinking: ‘Conditions are impermanent. How could it possibly be otherwise?’” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.11.14">Ānanda and Anuruddha spent the rest of the night talking about Dhamma. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.12.1">Then Anuruddha said to Ānanda, “Go, Ānanda, into Kusinārā and inform the Mallas: ‘Vāseṭṭhas, the Buddha has become fully extinguished. Please come at your convenience.’” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.12.5">“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Then, in the morning, he robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kusinārā with a companion. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.12.6">Now at that time the Mallas of Kusinārā were sitting together at the meeting hall on some business. Ānanda went up to them, and announced, “Vāseṭṭhas, the Buddha has become fully extinguished. Please come at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.12.10">When they heard what Ānanda had to say, the Mallas, their sons, daughters-in-law, and wives became distraught, saddened, and grief-stricken. And some, with hair disheveled and arms raised, falling down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamented, “Too soon the Blessed One has become fully extinguished! Too soon the Holy One has become fully extinguished! Too soon the seer has vanished from the world!” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">37. The Rites of Venerating the Buddha’s Corpse </h3>
<p id="dn16:6.13.1">Then the Mallas ordered their men, “So then, my men, collect fragrances and garlands, and all the musical instruments in Kusinārā.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.13.3">Then—taking those fragrances and garlands, all the musical instruments, and five hundred pairs of garments—they went to the Mallian sal grove at Upavattana and approached the Buddha’s corpse. They spent the day honoring, respecting, revering, and venerating the Buddha’s corpse with dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances, and making awnings and setting up pavilions. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.13.4">Then they thought, “It’s too late to cremate the Buddha’s corpse today. Let’s do it tomorrow.” But they spent the next day the same way, and so too the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth days. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.14.1">Then on the seventh day they thought, “Honoring, respecting, revering, and venerating the Buddha’s corpse with dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances, let us carry it to the south of the town, and cremate it there outside the town.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.14.3">Now at that time eight of the leading Mallas, having bathed their heads and dressed in unworn clothes, said, “We shall lift the Buddha’s corpse.” But they were unable to do so. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.14.5">The Mallas said to Anuruddha, “What is the cause, Venerable Anuruddha, what is the reason why these eight Mallian leaders are unable to lift the Buddha’s corpse?” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.14.8">“Vāseṭṭhas, you have one plan, but the deities have a different one.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.15.1">“But sir, what is the deities’ plan?” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.15.2">“You plan to carry the Buddha’s corpse to the south of the town while venerating it with dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances, and cremate it there outside the town. The deities plan to carry the Buddha’s corpse to the north of the town while venerating it with heavenly dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances. Then they plan to enter the town by the northern gate, carry it through the center of the town, leave by the eastern gate, and cremate it there at the Mallian shrine named Makuṭabandhana.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.15.6">“Sir, let it be as the deities plan.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.16.1">Now at that time the whole of Kusinārā was covered knee-deep with the flowers of the Flame Tree, without gaps even on the filth and rubbish heaps. Then the deities and the Mallas of Kusinārā carried the Buddha’s corpse to the north of the town while venerating it with heavenly and human dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances. Then they entered the town by the northern gate, carried it through the center of the town, left by the eastern gate, and deposited the corpse there at the Mallian shrine named Makuṭabandhana. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.17.1">Then the Mallas said to Anuruddha, “Sir, how do we proceed when it comes to the Realized One’s corpse?” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.17.3">“Proceed in the same way as they do for the corpse of a wheel-turning monarch.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.17.4">“But how do they proceed with a wheel-turning monarch’s corpse?” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.17.5">“They wrap a wheel-turning monarch’s corpse with unworn cloth, then with uncarded cotton, then again with unworn cloth. In this way they wrap the corpse with five hundred double-layers. Then they place it in an iron case filled with oil and close it up with another case. Then, having built a funeral pyre out of all kinds of fragrant substances, they cremate the corpse. They build a monument for the wheel-turning monarch at the crossroads. That’s how they proceed with a wheel-turning monarch’s corpse. Proceed in the same way with the Realized One’s corpse. A monument for the Realized One is to be built at the crossroads. When someone there lifts up garlands or fragrance or powder, or bows, or inspires confidence in their heart, that will be for their lasting welfare and happiness.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.18.1">Then the Mallas ordered their men, “So then, my men, collect uncarded cotton.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.18.3">So the Mallas wrapped the Buddha’s corpse, and placed it in an iron case filled with oil. Then, having built a funeral pyre out of all kinds of fragrant substances, they lifted the corpse on to the pyre. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">38. Mahākassapa’s Arrival </h3>
<p id="dn16:6.19.1">Now at that time Venerable Mahākassapa was traveling along the road from Pāvā to Kusinārā together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants. Then he left the road and sat at the root of a tree. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.19.3">Now at that time a certain Ājīvaka ascetic had picked up a Flame Tree flower in Kusinārā and was traveling along the road to Pāvā. Mahākassapa saw him coming off in the distance and said to him, “Reverend, might you know about our Teacher?” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.19.6">“Yes, reverend. Seven days ago the ascetic Gotama became fully extinguished. From there I picked up this Flame Tree flower.” Some of the mendicants there, with arms raised, falling down like their feet were chopped off, rolling back and forth, lamented, “Too soon the Blessed One has become fully extinguished! Too soon the Holy One has become fully extinguished! Too soon the seer has vanished from the world!” But the mendicants who were free of desire endured, mindful and aware, thinking, “Conditions are impermanent. How could it possibly be otherwise?” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.20.1">Now at that time a monk named Subhadda, who had gone forth when old, was sitting in that assembly. He said to those mendicants, “Enough, reverends, do not grieve or lament. We’re well rid of that Great Ascetic harassing us: ‘This is allowable for you; this is not allowable for you.’ Well, now we shall do what we want and not do what we don’t want.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.20.6">Then Venerable Mahākassapa addressed the mendicants, “Enough, reverends, do not grieve or lament. Did the Buddha not prepare us for this when he explained that we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved? How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out, even the Realized One’s body?” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.21.1">Now at that time four of the leading Mallas, having bathed their heads and dressed in unworn clothes, said, “We shall light the Buddha’s funeral pyre.” But they were unable to do so. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.21.3">The Mallas said to Anuruddha, “What is the cause, Venerable Anuruddha, what is the reason why these four Mallian leaders are unable to light the Buddha’s funeral pyre?” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.21.6">“Vāseṭṭhas, the deities have a different plan.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.21.7">“But sir, what is the deities’ plan?” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.21.8">“The deities’ plan is this: Venerable Mahākassapa is traveling along the road from Pāvā to Kusinārā together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants. The Buddha’s funeral pyre shall not burn until he bows with his head at the Buddha’s feet.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.21.11">“Sir, let it be as the deities plan.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.22.1">Then Venerable Mahākassapa came to the Mallian shrine named Makuṭabandhana at Kusinārā and approached the Buddha’s funeral pyre. Arranging his robe over one shoulder and raising his joined palms, he respectfully circled the Buddha three times, keeping him on his right, and bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet. And the five hundred mendicants did likewise. And when Mahākassapa and the five hundred mendicants bowed the Buddha’s funeral pyre burst into flames all by itself. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.23.1">And when the Buddha’s corpse was cremated no ash or soot was found from outer or inner skin, flesh, sinews, or synovial fluid. Only the relics remained. It’s like when ghee or oil blaze and burn, and neither ashes nor soot are found. In the same way, when the Buddha’s corpse was cremated no ash or soot was found from outer or inner skin, flesh, sinews, or synovial fluid. Only the relics remained. And of those five hundred pairs of garments only two were not burnt: the innermost and the outermost. But when the Buddha’s corpse was consumed the funeral pyre was extinguished by a stream of water that appeared in the sky, by water dripping from the sal trees, and by the Mallas’ fragrant water. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.23.10">Then the Mallas made a cage of spears for the Buddha’s relics in the meeting hall and surrounded it with a buttress of bows. For seven days they honored, respected, revered, and venerated them with dance and song and music and garlands and fragrances. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">39. Distributing the Relics </h3>
<p id="dn16:6.24.1">King Ajātasattu of Magadha heard that the Buddha had become fully extinguished at Kusinārā. He sent an envoy to the Mallas of Kusinārā: “The Buddha was an aristocrat, and so am I.

I will build a monument for them and conduct a memorial service.” </p>

<p id="dn16:6.25.1">When they had spoken, the Mallas of Kusinārā said to those various groups: “The Buddha became fully extinguished in our village district. We will not give away a share of his relics.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.25.3">Then Doṇa the brahmin said to those various groups: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn16:6.25.4">“Hear, sirs, a single word from me. <br/>Our Buddha’s teaching was acceptance. <br/>It would not be good to fight over <br/>a share of the supreme person’s relics. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.25.8">Let us make eight portions, good sirs, <br/>rejoicing in unity and harmony. <br/>Let there be monuments far and wide, <br/>so many folk may gain faith in the Seer!” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn16:6.25.12">“Well then, brahmin, you yourself should fairly divide the Buddha’s relics in eight portions.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.25.13">“Yes, sirs,” replied Doṇa to those various groups. He divided the relics as asked and said to them, “Sirs, please give me the urn, and I shall build a monument for it and conduct a memorial service.” So they gave Doṇa the urn. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.26.1">The Moras of Pippalivana heard that the Buddha had become fully extinguished at Kusinārā. They sent an envoy to the Mallas of Kusinārā: “The Buddha was an aristocrat, and so are we. We too deserve a share of the Buddha’s relics. We will build a monument for them and conduct a memorial service.” </p>
<p id="dn16:6.26.5">“There is no portion of the Buddha’s relics left, they have already been portioned out. Here, take the embers.” So they took the embers. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">40. Venerating the Relics </h3>
<p id="dn16:6.27.1">Then King Ajātasattu of Magadha, the Licchavis of Vesālī, the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu, the Bulas of Allakappa, the Koḷiyans of Rāmagāma, the brahmin of Veṭhadīpa, the Mallas of Pāvā, the Mallas of Kusinārā, the brahmin Doṇa, and the Moriyas of Pippalivana built monuments for them and conducted memorial services. Thus there were eight monuments for the relics, a ninth for the urn, and a tenth for the embers. That is how it was in those days. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn16:6.28.1">There were eight shares of the Seer’s relics. <br/>Seven were worshipped throughout India. <br/>But one share of the most excellent of men <br/>was worshipped in Rāmagāma by a dragon king. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.28.5">One tooth is venerated <j>by the gods of the Three and Thirty, </j><br/>and one is worshipped in the city of Gandhāra; <br/>another one in the realm of the Kaliṅga King, <br/>and one is worshipped by a dragon king. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.28.9">Through their glory this rich earth <br/>is adorned with the best of offerings. <br/>Thus the Seer’s corpse <br/>is well honored by the honorable. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.28.13">It’s venerated by lords of gods, dragons, and spirits; <br/>and likewise venerated by the finest lords of men. <br/>Honor it with joined palms when you get the chance, <br/>for a Buddha is rare even in a hundred eons. </p>
<p id="dn16:6.28.17">Altogether forty even teeth, <br/>and the body hair and head hair, <br/>were carried off individually by gods <br/>across the universe. </p>

<p id="dn17:1.1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying between a pair of sal trees in the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā at the time of his final extinguishment. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.2.1">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, please don’t become fully extinguished in this little hamlet, this jungle hamlet, this branch hamlet. There are other great cities such as Campā, Rājagaha, Sāvatthī, Sāketa, Kosambī, and Benares. Let the Buddha become fully extinguished there. There are many well-to-do aristocrats, brahmins, and householders there who are devoted to the Buddha. They will perform the rites of venerating the Realized One’s corpse.” </p>
<p id="dn17:1.3.1">“Don’t say that, Ānanda! Don’t say that this is a little hamlet, a jungle hamlet, a branch hamlet. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">1. The Capital City of Kusāvatī </h3>
<p id="dn17:1.3.4">Once upon a time there was a king named Mahāsudassana whose dominion extended to all four sides, and who achieved stability in the country. His capital was this Kusinārā, which at the time was named Kusāvatī. It stretched for twelve leagues from east to west, and seven leagues from north to south. The royal capital of Kusāvatī was successful, prosperous, populous, full of people, with plenty of food. It was just like Āḷakamandā, the royal capital of the gods, which is successful, prosperous, populous, full of spirits, with plenty of food. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.3.10">Kusāvatī was never free of ten sounds by day or night, namely: the sound of elephants, horses, chariots, drums, clay drums, arched harps, singing, horns, gongs, and handbells; and the cry, ‘Eat, drink, be merry!’ as the tenth. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.4.1">Kusāvatī was encircled by seven ramparts: one made of gold, one made of silver, one made of beryl, one made of crystal, one made of ruby, one made of emerald, and one made of all precious things. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.5.1">It had four gates, made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. At each gate there were seven pillars, three fathoms deep and four fathoms high, made of gold, silver, beryl, crystal, ruby, emerald, and all precious things. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.6.1">It was surrounded by seven rows of palm trees, made of gold, silver, beryl, crystal, ruby, emerald, and all precious things. The golden palms had trunks of gold, and leaves and fruits of silver. The silver palms had trunks of silver, and leaves and fruits of gold. The beryl palms had trunks of beryl, and leaves and fruits of crystal. The crystal palms had trunks of crystal, and leaves and fruits of beryl. The ruby palms had trunks of ruby, and leaves and fruits of emerald. The emerald palms had trunks of emerald, and leaves and fruits of ruby. The palms of all precious things had trunks of all precious things, and leaves and fruits of all precious things. When those rows of palm trees were blown by the wind they sounded graceful, tantalizing, sensuous, lovely, and intoxicating, like a quintet made up of skilled musicians who had practiced well and kept excellent rhythm. And any addicts, carousers, or drunkards in Kusāvatī at that time were entertained by that sound. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. The Seven Treasures </h3>
<h4 class="subheading">2.1. The Wheel-Treasure </h4>
<p id="dn17:1.7.1">King Mahāsudassana possessed seven treasures and four blessings. What seven? </p>
<p id="dn17:1.7.3">On a fifteenth day sabbath, King Mahāsudassana had bathed his head and gone upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbath. And the heavenly wheel-treasure appeared to him, with a thousand spokes, with rim and hub, complete in every detail. Seeing this, the king thought, ‘I have heard that when the heavenly wheel-treasure appears to a king in this way, he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. Am I then a wheel-turning monarch?’ </p>
<p id="dn17:1.8.1">Then King Mahāsudassana, rising from his seat and arranging his robe over one shoulder, took a ceremonial vase in his left hand and besprinkled the wheel-treasure with his right hand, saying: ‘Roll forth, O wheel-treasure! Triumph, O wheel-treasure!’ </p>
<p id="dn17:1.8.3">Then the wheel-treasure rolled towards the east. And the king followed it together with his army of four divisions. In whatever place the wheel-treasure stood still, there the king came to stay together with his army. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.9.1">And any opposing rulers of the eastern quarter came to him and said, ‘Come, great king! Welcome, great king! We are yours, great king, instruct us.’ </p>
<p id="dn17:1.9.3">The king said, ‘Do not kill living creatures. Do not steal. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not lie. Do not drink alcohol. Maintain the current level of taxation.’ And so the opposing rulers of the eastern quarter became his vassals. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.10.1">Then the wheel-treasure, having plunged into the eastern ocean and emerged again, rolled towards the south. … </p>
<p id="dn17:1.10.2">Having plunged into the southern ocean and emerged again, it rolled towards the west. … </p>
<p id="dn17:1.10.3">Having plunged into the western ocean and emerged again, it rolled towards the north, followed by the king together with his army of four divisions. In whatever place the wheel-treasure stood still, there the king came to stay together with his army. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.10.5">And any opposing rulers of the northern quarter came to him and said, ‘Come, great king! Welcome, great king! We are yours, great king, instruct us.’ </p>
<p id="dn17:1.10.7">The king said, ‘Do not kill living creatures. Do not steal. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not lie. Do not drink alcohol. Maintain the current level of taxation.’ And so the opposing rulers of the northern quarter became his vassals. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.11.1">And then the wheel-treasure, having triumphed over this land surrounded by ocean, returned to the royal capital of Kusāvatī. There it stood still by the gate to Mahāsudassana’s royal compound at the High Court as if fixed to an axle, illuminating the royal compound. Such is the wheel-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.2. The Elephant-Treasure </h4>
<p id="dn17:1.12.1">Next, the elephant-treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana. It was an all-white sky-walker with psychic power, touching the ground in seven places, a king of elephants named Sabbath. Seeing him, the king was impressed, ‘This would truly be a fine elephant vehicle, if he would submit to taming.’ Then the elephant-treasure submitted to taming, as if he was a fine thoroughbred elephant that had been tamed for a long time. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.12.6">Once it so happened that King Mahāsudassana, testing that same elephant-treasure, mounted him in the morning and traversed the land surrounded by ocean before returning to the royal capital in time for breakfast. Such is the elephant-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.3. The Horse-Treasure </h4>
<p id="dn17:1.13.1">Next, the horse-treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana. It was an all-white sky-walker with psychic power, with head of black and mane like woven reeds, a royal steed named Thundercloud. Seeing him, the king was impressed, ‘This would truly be a fine horse vehicle, if he would submit to taming.’ Then the horse-treasure submitted to taming, as if he was a fine thoroughbred horse that had been tamed for a long time. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.13.6">Once it so happened that King Mahāsudassana, testing that same horse-treasure, mounted him in the morning and traversed the land surrounded by ocean before returning to the royal capital in time for breakfast. Such is the horse-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.4. The Jewel-Treasure </h4>
<p id="dn17:1.14.1">Next, the jewel-treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana. It was a beryl gem that was naturally beautiful, eight-faceted, well-worked, transparent, clear, and unclouded, endowed with all good qualities. And the radiance of that jewel spread all-round for a league. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.14.4">Once it so happened that King Mahāsudassana, testing that same jewel-treasure, mobilized his army of four divisions and, with the jewel hoisted on his banner, set out in the dark of the night. Then the villagers around them set off to work, thinking that it was day. Such is the jewel-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.5. The Woman-Treasure </h4>
<p id="dn17:1.15.1">Next, the woman-treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana. She was attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. She was neither too tall nor too short; neither too thin nor too fat; neither too dark nor too light. She outdid human beauty without reaching divine beauty. And her touch was like a tuft of cotton-wool or kapok. When it was cool her limbs were warm, and when it was warm her limbs were cool. The fragrance of sandal floated from her body, and lotus from her mouth. She got up before the king and went to bed after him, and was obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely. The woman-treasure did not betray the wheel-turning monarch even in thought, still less in deed. Such is the woman-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.6. The Householder-Treasure </h4>
<p id="dn17:1.16.1">Next, the householder-treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana. The power of clairvoyance manifested in him as a result of past deeds, by which he sees hidden treasure, both owned and ownerless. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.16.3">He approached the king and said, ‘Relax, sire. I will take care of the treasury.’ </p>
<p id="dn17:1.16.5">Once it so happened that the wheel-turning monarch, testing that same householder-treasure, boarded a boat and sailed to the middle of the Ganges river. Then he said to the householder-treasure, ‘Householder, I need gold coins and bullion.’ </p>
<p id="dn17:1.16.7">‘Well then, great king, draw the boat up to one shore.’ </p>
<p id="dn17:1.16.8">‘It’s right here, householder, that I need gold coins and bullion.’ </p>
<p id="dn17:1.16.9">Then that householder-treasure, immersing both hands in the water, pulled up a pot full of gold coin and bullion, and said to the king, ‘Is this sufficient, great king? Has enough been done, great king, enough offered?’ </p>
<p id="dn17:1.16.11">The king said, ‘That is sufficient, householder. Enough has been done, enough offered.’ </p>
<p id="dn17:1.16.13">Such is the householder-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.7. The Counselor-Treasure </h4>
<p id="dn17:1.18.1">Next, the counselor-treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana. He was astute, competent, intelligent, and capable of getting the king to appoint who should be appointed, dismiss who should be dismissed, and retain who should be retained. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.18.3">He approached the king and said, ‘Relax, sire. I shall issue instructions.’ </p>
<p id="dn17:1.18.5">Such is the counselor-treasure that appeared to King Mahāsudassana. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.18.6">These are the seven treasures possessed by King Mahāsudassana. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">3. The Four Blessings </h3>
<p id="dn17:1.18.8">King Mahāsudassana possessed four blessings. And what are the four blessings? </p>
<p id="dn17:1.18.10">He was attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty, more so than other people. This is the first blessing. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.19.1">Furthermore, he was long-lived, more so than other people. This is the second blessing. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.20.1">Furthermore, he was rarely ill or unwell, and his stomach digested well, being neither too hot nor too cold, more so than other people. This is the third blessing. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.21.1">Furthermore, he was as dear and beloved to the brahmins and householders as a father is to his children. And the brahmins and householders were as dear to the king as children are to their father. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.21.7">Once it so happened that King Mahāsudassana went with his army of four divisions to visit a park. Then the brahmins and householders went up to him and said, ‘Slow down, Your Majesty, so we may see you longer!’ And the king addressed his charioteer, ‘Drive slowly, charioteer, so I can see the brahmins and householders longer!’ This is the fourth blessing. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.21.13">These are the four blessings possessed by King Mahāsudassana. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">4. Lotus Ponds in the Palace of Principle </h3>
<p id="dn17:1.22.1">Then King Mahāsudassana thought, ‘Why don’t I have lotus ponds built between the palms, at intervals of a hundred bow lengths?’ </p>
<p id="dn17:1.22.3">So that’s what he did. The lotus ponds were lined with tiles of four colors, made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.22.6">And four flights of stairs of four colors descended into each lotus pond, made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The golden stairs had posts of gold, and banisters and finials of silver. The silver stairs had posts of silver, and banisters and finials of gold. The beryl stairs had posts of beryl, and banisters and finials of crystal. The crystal stairs had posts of crystal, and banisters and finials of beryl. Those lotus ponds were surrounded by two balustrades, made of gold and silver. The golden balustrades had posts of gold, and banisters and finials of silver. The silver balustrades had posts of silver, and banisters and finials of gold. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.23.1">Then King Mahāsudassana thought, ‘Why don’t I plant flowers in the lotus ponds such as blue water lilies, and lotuses of pink, yellow, and white, blooming all year round, and accessible to the public?’ So that’s what he did. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.23.4">Then King Mahāsudassana thought, ‘Why don’t I appoint bath attendants to help bathe the people who come to bathe in the lotus ponds?’ So that’s what he did. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.23.7">Then King Mahāsudassana thought, ‘Why don’t I set up charities on the banks of the lotus ponds, so that those in need of food, drink, clothes, vehicles, beds, women, gold, or silver can get what they need?’ So that’s what he did. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.24.1">Then the brahmins and householders came to the king bringing abundant wealth and said, ‘Sire, this abundant wealth is specially for you alone; may Your Highness accept it!’ </p>
<p id="dn17:1.24.3">‘There’s enough raised for me through regular taxes. Let this be for you; and here, take even more!’ </p>
<p id="dn17:1.24.4">When the king turned them down, they withdrew to one side to think up a plan, ‘It wouldn’t be proper for us to take this abundant wealth back to our own homes. Why don’t we build a home for King Mahāsudassana?’ </p>
<p id="dn17:1.24.7">They went up to the king and said, ‘We shall have a home built for you, sire!’ King Mahāsudassana consented in silence. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.25.1">And then Sakka, lord of gods, knowing what the king was thinking, addressed the god Vissakamma, ‘Come, dear Vissakamma, build a palace named Principle as a home for King Mahāsudassana.’ </p>
<p id="dn17:1.25.3">‘Yes, lord,’ replied Vissakamma. Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the gods of the Thirty-Three and appeared in front of King Mahāsudassana. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.25.4">Vissakamma said to the king, ‘I shall build a palace named Principle as a home for you, sire.’ King Mahāsudassana consented in silence. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.25.7">And so that’s what Vissakamma did. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.25.8">The Palace of Principle stretched for a league from east to west, and half a league from north to south. It was lined with tiles of four colors, three fathoms high, made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.26.1">It had 84,000 pillars of four colors, made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. It was covered with panels of four colors, made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.26.5">It had twenty-four staircases of four colors, made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The golden stairs had posts of gold, and banisters and finials of silver. The silver stairs had posts of silver, and banisters and finials of gold. The beryl stairs had posts of beryl, and banisters and finials of crystal. The crystal stairs had posts of crystal, and banisters and finials of beryl. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.26.11">It had 84,000 chambers of four colors, made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. In each chamber a couch was spread: in the golden chamber a couch of silver; in the silver chamber a couch of gold; in the beryl chamber a couch of ivory; in the crystal chamber a couch of hardwood. At the door of the golden chamber stood a palm tree of silver, with trunk of silver, and leaves and fruits of gold. At the door of the silver chamber stood a palm tree of gold, with trunk of gold, and leaves and fruits of silver. At the door of the beryl chamber stood a palm tree of crystal, with trunk of crystal, and leaves and fruits of beryl. At the door of the crystal chamber stood a palm tree of beryl, with trunk of beryl, and leaves and fruits of crystal. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.27.1">Then King Mahāsudassana thought, ‘Why don’t I build a grove of golden palm trees at the door to the great foyer, where I can sit for the day?’ So that’s what he did. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.28.1">The Palace of Principle was surrounded by two balustrades, made of gold and silver. The golden balustrades had posts of gold, and banisters and finials of silver. The silver balustrades had posts of silver, and banisters and finials of gold. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.29.1">The Palace of Principle was surrounded by two nets of bells, made of gold and silver. The golden net had bells of silver, and the silver net had bells of gold. When those nets of bells were blown by the wind they sounded graceful, tantalizing, sensuous, lovely, and intoxicating, like a quintet made up of skilled musicians who had practiced well and kept excellent rhythm. And any addicts, carousers, or drunkards in Kusāvatī at that time were entertained by that sound. When it was finished, the palace was hard to look at, dazzling to the eyes, like the sun rising in a clear and cloudless sky in the last month of the rainy season. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.30.1">Then King Mahāsudassana thought, ‘Why don’t I build a lotus pond named Principle in front of the palace?’ So that’s what he did. The Lotus Pond of Principle stretched for a league from east to west, and half a league from north to south. It was lined with tiles of four colors, made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.31.1">It had twenty-four staircases of four colors, made of gold, silver, beryl, and crystal. The golden stairs had posts of gold, and banisters and finials of silver. The silver stairs had posts of silver, and banisters and finials of gold. The beryl stairs had posts of beryl, and banisters and finials of crystal. The crystal stairs had posts of crystal, and banisters and finials of beryl. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.31.7">It was surrounded by two balustrades, made of gold and silver. The golden balustrades had posts of gold, and banisters and finials of silver. The silver balustrades had posts of silver, and banisters and finials of gold. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.32.1">It was surrounded by seven rows of palm trees, made of gold, silver, beryl, crystal, ruby, emerald, and all precious things. The golden palms had trunks of gold, and leaves and fruits of silver. The silver palms had trunks of silver, and leaves and fruits of gold. The beryl palms had trunks of beryl, and leaves and fruits of crystal. The crystal palms had trunks of crystal, and leaves and fruits of beryl. The ruby palms had trunks of ruby, and leaves and fruits of emerald. The emerald palms had trunks of emerald, and leaves and fruits of ruby. The palms of all precious things had trunks of all precious things, and leaves and fruits of all precious things. When those rows of palm trees were blown by the wind they sounded graceful, tantalizing, sensuous, lovely, and intoxicating, like a quintet made up of skilled musicians who had practiced well and kept excellent rhythm. And any addicts, carousers, or drunkards in Kusāvatī at that time were entertained by that sound. </p>
<p id="dn17:1.33.1">When the palace and its lotus pond were finished, King Mahāsudassana served those who were reckoned as true ascetics and brahmins with all they desired. Then he ascended the Palace of Principle. </p>
<p class="endsection" id="dn17:1.33.2">The first recitation section. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">5. Attaining Absorption </h3>
<p id="dn17:2.1.1">Then King Mahāsudassana thought, ‘Of what deed of mine is this the fruit and result, that I am now so mighty and powerful?’ </p>
<p id="dn17:2.1.3">Then King Mahāsudassana thought, ‘It is the fruit and result of three kinds of deeds: giving, self-control, and restraint.’ </p>
<p id="dn17:2.2.1">Then he went to the great foyer, stood at the door, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment: ‘Stop here, sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts—no further!’ </p>
<p id="dn17:2.3.1">Then he entered the great foyer and sat on the golden couch. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, he entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, he entered and remained in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, he entered and remained in the third absorption, where he meditated with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, he entered and remained in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. </p>
<p id="dn17:2.4.1">Then King Mahāsudassana left the great foyer and entered the golden chamber, where he sat on the golden couch. He meditated spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way he spread a heart full of love above, below, across, everywhere, all around, to everyone in the world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. He meditated spreading a heart full of compassion … He meditated spreading a heart full of rejoicing … He meditated spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, he spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">6. Of All Cities </h3>
<p id="dn17:2.5.1">King Mahāsudassana had 84,000 cities, with the royal capital of Kusāvatī foremost. He had 84,000 palaces, with the Palace of Principle foremost. He had 84,000 chambers, with the great foyer foremost. He had 84,000 couches made of gold, silver, ivory, and hardwood. They were spread with woollen covers—shag-piled, pure white, or embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red pillows at both ends. He had 84,000 bull elephants with gold adornments and banners, covered with gold netting, with the royal bull elephant named Sabbath foremost. He had 84,000 horses with gold adornments and banners, covered with gold netting, with the royal steed named Thundercloud foremost. He had 84,000 chariots upholstered with the hide of lions, tigers, and leopards, and cream rugs, with gold adornments and banners, covered with gold netting, with the chariot named Triumph foremost. He had 84,000 jewels, with the jewel-treasure foremost. He had 84,000 women, with Queen Subhaddā foremost. He had 84,000 householders, with the householder-treasure foremost. He had 84,000 aristocrat vassals, with the counselor-treasure foremost. He had 84,000 milk-cows with silken reins and bronze pails. He had 8,400,000,000 fine cloths of linen, cotton, silk, and wool. He had 84,000 servings of food, which were presented to him as offerings in the morning and evening. </p>
<p id="dn17:2.6.1">Now at that time his 84,000 royal elephants came to attend on him in the morning and evening. Then King Mahāsudassana thought, ‘What if instead half of the elephants took turns to attend on me at the end of each century?’ He instructed the counselor-treasure to do this, and so it was done. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">7. The Visit of Queen Subhaddā </h3>
<p id="dn17:2.7.1">Then, after many years, many hundred years, many thousand years had passed, Queen Subhaddā thought, ‘It is long since I have seen the king. Why don’t I go to see him?’ </p>
<p id="dn17:2.7.3">So the queen addressed the ladies of the harem, ‘Come, bathe your heads and dress in yellow. It is long since we saw the king, and we shall go to see him.’ </p>
<p id="dn17:2.7.6">‘Yes, ma’am,’ replied the ladies of the harem. They did as she asked and returned to the queen. </p>
<p id="dn17:2.8.1">Then the queen addressed the counselor-treasure, ‘Dear counselor-treasure, please ready the army of four divisions. It is long since we saw the king, and we shall go to see him.’ </p>
<p id="dn17:2.8.3">‘Yes, my queen,’ he replied, and did as he was asked. He informed the queen, ‘My queen, the army of four divisions is ready, please go at your convenience.’ </p>
<p id="dn17:2.8.6">Then Queen Subhaddā together with the ladies of the harem went with the army to the Palace of Principle. She ascended the palace and went to the great foyer, where she stood leaning against a door-post. </p>
<p id="dn17:2.8.8">Hearing them, the king thought, ‘What’s that, it sounds like a big crowd!’ Coming out of the foyer he saw Queen Subhaddā leaning against a door-post and said to her, ‘Please stay there, my queen, don’t enter in here.’ </p>
<p id="dn17:2.9.1">Then he addressed a certain man, ‘Come, mister, bring the golden couch from the great foyer and set it up in the golden palm grove.’ </p>
<p id="dn17:2.9.3">‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ that man replied, and did as he was asked. The king laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware. </p>
<p id="dn17:2.10.1">Then Queen Subhaddā thought, ‘The king’s faculties are so very clear, and the complexion of his skin is pure and bright. Let him not pass away!’ She said to him, ‘Sire, you have 84,000 cities, with the royal capital of Kusāvatī foremost. Arouse desire for these! Take an interest in life!’ </p>
<p id="dn17:2.10.5">And she likewise urged the king to live on by taking an interest in all his possessions as described above. </p>
<p id="dn17:2.11.1">When the queen had spoken, the king said to her, ‘For a long time, my queen, you have spoken to me with loving, desirable, pleasant, and agreeable words. And yet in my final hour, your words are undesirable, unpleasant, and disagreeable!’ </p>
<p id="dn17:2.11.4">‘Then how exactly, Your Majesty, am I to speak to you?’ </p>
<p id="dn17:2.11.5">‘Like this, my queen: “Sire, we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved. Don’t pass away with concerns. Such concern is suffering, and it’s criticized. Sire, you have 84,000 cities, with the royal capital of Kusāvatī foremost. Give up desire for these! Take no interest in life!”’ And so on for all the king’s possessions. </p>
<p id="dn17:2.12.1">When the king had spoken, Queen Subhaddā cried and burst out in tears. Wiping away her tears, the queen said to the king: ‘Sire, we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved. Don’t pass away with concerns. Such concern is suffering, and it’s criticized. Sire, you have 84,000 cities, with the royal capital of Kusāvatī foremost. Give up desire for these! Take no interest in life!’ And she continued, listing all the king’s possessions. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">8. Rebirth in the Brahmā Realm </h3>
<p id="dn17:2.13.1">Not long after that, King Mahāsudassana passed away. And the feeling he had close to death was like a householder or their child falling asleep after eating a delectable meal. </p>
<p id="dn17:2.13.3">When he passed away King Mahāsudassana was reborn in a good place, a Brahmā realm. Ānanda, King Mahāsudassana played children’s games for 84,000 years. He ruled as viceroy for 84,000 years. He ruled as king for 84,000 years. He led the spiritual life as a layman in the Palace of Principle for 84,000 years. And having developed the four Brahmā meditations, when his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in a good place, a Brahmā realm. </p>
<p id="dn17:2.14.1">Now, Ānanda, you might think: ‘Surely King Mahāsudassana must have been someone else at that time?’ But you should not see it like that. I myself was King Mahāsudassana at that time. </p>
<p id="dn17:2.14.4">Mine were the 84,000 cities, with the royal capital of Kusāvatī foremost. And mine were all the other possessions. </p>
<p id="dn17:2.15.1">Of those 84,000 cities, I only stayed in one, the capital Kusāvatī. Of those 84,000 mansions, I only dwelt in one, the Palace of Principle. Of those 84,000 chambers, I only dwelt in the great foyer. Of those 84,000 couches, I only used one, made of gold or silver or ivory or heartwood. Of those 84,000 bull elephants, I only rode one, the royal bull elephant named Sabbath. Of those 84,000 horses, I only rode one, the royal horse named Thundercloud. Of those 84,000 chariots, I only rode one, the chariot named Triumph. Of those 84,000 women, I was only served by one, a maiden of the aristocratic or merchant classes. Of those 8,400,000,000 cloths, I only wore one pair, made of fine linen, cotton, silk, or wool. Of those 84,000 servings of food, I only had one, eating at most a serving of rice and suitable sauce. </p>
<p id="dn17:2.16.1">See, Ānanda! All those conditioned phenomena have passed, ceased, and perished. So impermanent are conditions, so unstable are conditions, so unreliable are conditions. This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions. </p>
<p id="dn17:2.17.1">Six times, Ānanda, I recall having laid down my body at this place. And the seventh time was as a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king, at which time my dominion extended to all four sides, I achieved stability in the country, and I possessed the seven treasures. But Ānanda, I do not see any place in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans where the Realized One would lay down his body for the eighth time.” </p>
<p id="dn17:2.17.3">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn17:2.17.5">“Oh! Conditions are impermanent, <br/>their nature is to rise and fall; <br/>having arisen, they cease; <br/>their stilling is true bliss.” </p>

<h3 class="subheading">1. Declaring the Rebirths of People From Nādika and Elsewhere </h3>
<p id="dn18:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Nādika in the brick house. </p>
<p id="dn18:1.3">Now at that time the Buddha was explaining the rebirths of devotees all over the nations; the Kāsis and Kosalans, Vajjis and Mallas, Cetīs and Vaṁsas, Kurus and Pañcālas, Macchas and Sūrasenas: </p>
<p id="dn18:1.4">“This one was reborn here, while that one was reborn there. </p>
<p id="dn18:1.5">Over fifty devotees in Nādika have passed away having ended the five lower fetters. They’ve been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. </p>
<p id="dn18:1.6">More than ninety devotees in Nādika have passed away having ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. They’re once-returners, who will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. </p>
<p id="dn18:1.7">In excess of five hundred devotees in Nādika have passed away having ended three fetters. They’re stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.” </p>
<p id="dn18:2.1">When the devotees of Nādika heard about the Buddha’s answers to those questions, they became uplifted and overjoyed, full of rapture and happiness. </p>
<p id="dn18:3.1">Venerable Ānanda heard of the Buddha’s statements and the Nādikans’ happiness. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. Ānanda’s Suggestion </h3>
<p id="dn18:4.1">Then Venerable Ānanda thought, “But there were also Magadhan devotees—many, and of long standing too—who have passed away. You’d think that Aṅga and Magadha were empty of devotees who have passed away! But they too had confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and had fulfilled their ethics. The Buddha hasn’t declared their passing. It would be good to do so, for many people would gain confidence, and so be reborn in a good place. </p>
<p id="dn18:4.7">That King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was a just and principled king who benefited the brahmins and householders of town and country. People still sing his praises: ‘That just and principled king, who made us so happy, has passed away. Life was good under his dominion.’ He too had confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and had fulfilled his ethics. People say: ‘Until his dying day, King Bimbisāra sang the Buddha’s praises!’ The Buddha hasn’t declared his passing. It would be good to do so, for many people would gain confidence, and so be reborn in a good place. </p>
<p id="dn18:4.15">Besides, the Buddha was awakened in Magadha; so why hasn’t he declared the rebirth of the Magadhan devotees? If he fails to do so, they will be dejected.” </p>
<p id="dn18:5.1">After pondering the fate of the Magadhan devotees alone in private, Ānanda rose at the crack of dawn and went to see the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told the Buddha of his concerns, finishing by saying, “Why hasn’t the Buddha declared the rebirth of the Magadhan devotees? If he fails to do so, they will be dejected.” Then Ānanda, after making this suggestion regarding the Magadhan devotees, got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. </p>
<p id="dn18:7.1">Soon after Ānanda had left, the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Nādika for alms. He wandered for alms in Nādika. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he washed his feet and entered the brick house. He paid heed, paid attention, and concentrated wholeheartedly on the fate of Magadhan devotees, and sat on the seat spread out, thinking, “I shall know their destiny, where they are reborn in the next life.” And he saw where they had been reborn. </p>
<p id="dn18:7.6">Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat. Emerging from the brick house, he sat on the seat spread out in the shade of the porch. </p>
<p id="dn18:8.1">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, you look so serene; your face seems to shine owing to the clarity of your faculties. Have you been abiding in a peaceful meditation today, sir?” </p>
<p id="dn18:9.1">The Buddha then recounted what had happened since speaking to Ānanda, revealing that he had seen the destiny of the Magadhan devotees. He continued: </p>
<h3 class="subheading">3. Janavasabha the Spirit </h3>
<p id="dn18:9.5">“Then, Ānanda an invisible spirit called out: ‘I am Janavasabha, Blessed One! I am Janavasabha, Holy One!’ Ānanda, do you recall having previously heard such a name as Janavasabha?” </p>
<p id="dn18:9.9">“No, sir. But when I heard the word, I got goosebumps! I thought, ‘This must be no ordinary spirit to bear such an exalted name as Janavasabha.’” </p>
<p id="dn18:10.1">“After making himself heard while invisible, Ānanda, a very beautiful spirit appeared in front of me. And for a second time he called out: ‘I am Bimbisāra, Blessed One! I am Bimbisāra, Holy One! This is the seventh time I have been reborn in the company of the Great King Vessavaṇa. After passing away from there, I am now able to become a king of non-humans. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn18:10.6">Seven from here, seven from there—<br/>fourteen transmigrations in all. <br/>That’s how many past lives <br/>I can recollect. </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn18:10.10">For a long time I’ve known that I won’t be reborn in the underworld, but that I still hope to become a once-returner.’ </p>
<p id="dn18:10.11">‘It’s incredible and amazing that you, the venerable spirit Janavasabha, should say: </p>
<p id="dn18:10.12">“For a long time I’ve been aware that I won’t be reborn in the underworld” and also “But I still hope to become a once-returner.” But from what source do you know that you’ve achieved such a high distinction?’ </p>
<p id="dn18:11.1">‘None other than the Blessed One’s instruction! None other than the Holy One’s instruction! From the day I had absolute devotion to the Buddha I have known that I won’t be reborn in the underworld, but that I still hope to become a once-returner. Just now, sir, I had been sent out by the great king Vessavaṇa to the great king Virūḷhaka’s presence on some business, and on the way I saw the Buddha giving his attention to the fate of the Magadhan devotees. But it comes as no surprise that I have heard and learned the fate of the Magadhan devotees in the presence of the great king Vessavaṇa as he was speaking to his assembly. It occurred to me, “I shall see the Buddha and inform him of this.” These are the two reasons I’ve come to see the Buddha. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">4. The Council of the Gods </h3>
<p id="dn18:12.1">Sir, it was more than a few days ago—on the fifteenth day sabbath on the full moon day at the entry to the rainy season—when all the gods of the Thirty-Three were sitting together in the Hall of Justice. A large assembly of gods was sitting all around, and the Four Great Kings were seated at the four quarters. </p>
<p id="dn18:12.3">The Great King Dhataraṭṭha was seated to the east, facing west, in front of his gods. The Great King Virūḷhaka was seated to the south, facing north, in front of his gods. The Great King Virūpakkha was seated to the west, facing east, in front of his gods. The Great King Vessavaṇa was seated to the north, facing south, in front of his gods. When the gods of the Thirty-Three have a gathering like this, that is how they are seated. After that come our seats. </p>
<p id="dn18:12.9">Sir, those gods who had been recently reborn in the company of the Thirty-Three after leading the spiritual life under the Buddha outshone the other gods in beauty and glory. The gods of the Thirty-Three became uplifted and overjoyed at that, full of rapture and happiness, saying, “The heavenly hosts swell, while the demon hosts dwindle!” </p>
<p id="dn18:13.1">Seeing the joy of those gods, Sakka, lord of gods, celebrated with these verses: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn18:13.2">“The gods rejoice—<br/>the Thirty-Three with their Lord—<br/>revering the Realized One, <br/>and the natural excellence of the teaching; </p>
<p id="dn18:13.6">and seeing the new gods, <br/>so beautiful and glorious, <br/>who have come here after leading <br/>the spiritual life under the Buddha! </p>
<p id="dn18:13.10">They outshine the others <br/>in beauty, glory, and lifespan. <br/>Here are the distinguished disciples <br/>of he whose wisdom is vast. </p>
<p id="dn18:13.14">Seeing this, they delight—<br/>the Thirty-Three with their Lord—<br/>revering the Realized One, <br/>and the natural excellence of the teaching.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn18:13.18">The gods of the Thirty-Three became even more uplifted and overjoyed at that, saying: “The heavenly hosts swell, while the demon hosts dwindle!” </p>
<p id="dn18:14.1">Then the gods of the Thirty-Three, having considered and deliberated on the matter for which they were seated together in the Hall of Justice, advised and instructed the Four Great Kings on the subject. And each stood at his own seat without departing. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn18:14.3">The Kings were instructed, <br/>and heeded good advice. <br/>With clear and peaceful minds, <br/>they stood by their own seats. </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn18:15.1">Then in the northern quarter a magnificent light arose and radiance appeared, surpassing the glory of the gods. Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three, “As indicated by the signs—light arising and radiance appearing—Brahmā will appear. For this is the precursor for the appearance of Brahmā, namely light arising and radiance appearing.” </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn18:15.4">As indicated by the signs, <br/>Brahmā will appear. <br/>For this is the sign of Brahmā: <br/>a light vast and great. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="subheading">5. On Sanaṅkumāra </h3>
<p id="dn18:16.1">Then the gods of the Thirty-Three sat in their own seats, saying, “We shall find out what has caused that light, and only when we have realized it shall we go to it.” And the Four Great Kings did likewise. </p>
<p id="dn18:16.5">Hearing that, the gods of the Thirty-Three agreed in unison, “We shall find out what has caused that light, and only when we have realized it shall we go to it.” </p>
<p id="dn18:17.1">When Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the Thirty-Three, he does so after manifesting in a solid corporeal form. For the gods of the Thirty-Three aren’t able to see a Brahmā’s normal appearance. When Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the Thirty-Three, he outshines the other gods in beauty and glory, as a golden statue outshines the human form. </p>
<p id="dn18:17.6">When Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the Thirty-Three, not a single god in that assembly greets him by bowing down or rising up or inviting him to a seat. They all sit silently on their couches with their joined palms raised, thinking, “Now Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra will sit on the couch of whatever god he chooses.” And the god on whose couch Brahmā sits is overjoyed and brimming with happiness, like a king on the day of his coronation. </p>
<p id="dn18:18.3">Then Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra manifested in a solid corporeal form, taking on the appearance of the youth Pañcasikha, and appeared to the gods of the Thirty-Three. Rising into the air, he sat cross-legged in the sky, like a strong man might sit cross-legged on a well-appointed couch or on level ground. Seeing the joy of those gods, Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra celebrated with these verses: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn18:18.7">“The gods rejoice—<br/>the Thirty-Three with their Lord—<br/>revering the Realized One, <br/>and the natural excellence of the teaching; </p>
<p id="dn18:18.11">and seeing the new gods, <br/>so beautiful and glorious, <br/>who have come here after leading <br/>the spiritual life under the Buddha! </p>
<p id="dn18:18.15">They outshine the others <br/>in beauty, glory, and lifespan. <br/>Here are the distinguished disciples <br/>of he whose wisdom is vast. </p>
<p id="dn18:18.19">Seeing this, they delight—<br/>the Thirty-Three with their Lord—<br/>revering the Realized One, <br/>and the natural excellence of the teaching!” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn18:19.1">That is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spoke. And while he was speaking on that topic, his voice had eight qualities: it was clear, comprehensible, charming, audible, lucid, undistorted, deep, and resonant. He makes sure his voice is intelligible as far as the assembly goes, but it doesn’t extend outside the assembly. When someone has a voice like this, they’re said to have the voice of Brahmā. </p>
<p id="dn18:20.1">Then Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra, having manifested thirty-three corporeal forms, sat down on the couches of each of the gods of the Thirty-Three and addressed them, “What do the good gods of the Thirty-Three think about how much the Buddha has acted for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans? For consider those who have gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and have fulfilled their ethics. When their bodies break up, after death, some are reborn in the company of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others, some with the Gods Who Love to Create, some with the Joyful Gods, some with the Gods of Yama, some with the Gods of the Thirty-Three, and some with the Gods of the Four Great Kings. And at the very least they swell the hosts of the fairies.” </p>
<p id="dn18:21.1">That is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spoke. And while he was speaking on that topic, each of the gods fancied, “The one sitting on my couch is the only one speaking.” </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn18:21.4">When one is speaking, <br/>all the forms speak. <br/>When one sits in silence, <br/>they all remain silent. </p>
<p id="dn18:21.8">But those gods imagine—<br/>the Thirty-Three with their Lord—<br/>that the one on their seat <br/>is the only one to speak. </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn18:22.1">The Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra merged into one corporeal form. Then he sat on the couch of Sakka, lord of gods, and addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three: </p>
<h3 class="subheading">6. Developing the Bases of Psychic Power </h3>
<p id="dn18:22.3">“What do the good gods of the Thirty-Three think about how much the four bases of psychic power have been clearly described by the Blessed One—the one who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—for the multiplication, generation, and transformation of corporeal forms through psychic power? What four? It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort. They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy, and active effort. They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to mental development, and active effort. They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to inquiry, and active effort. These are the four bases of psychic power that have been clearly described by the Buddha, for the multiplication, generation, and transformation of corporeal forms through psychic power. </p>
<p id="dn18:22.10">All the ascetics and brahmins in the past, future, or present who wield the many kinds of psychic power do so by developing and cultivating these four bases of psychic power. Gentlemen, do you see such psychic might and power in me?” </p>
<p id="dn18:22.14">“Yes, Great Brahmā.” </p>
<p id="dn18:22.15">“I too became so mighty and powerful by developing and cultivating these four bases of psychic power.” </p>
<p id="dn18:23.1">That is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spoke. And having spoken about that, he addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three: </p>
<h3 class="subheading">7. The Three Openings </h3>
<p id="dn18:23.4">“What do the good gods of the Thirty-Three think about how much the Buddha has understood the three opportunities for achieving happiness? What three? </p>
<p id="dn18:23.6">First, take someone who lives mixed up with sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities. After some time they hear the teaching of the noble ones, properly attend to how it applies to them, and practice accordingly. They live aloof from sensual pleasures and unskillful qualities. That gives rise to pleasure, and more than pleasure, happiness, like the joy that’s born from gladness. This is the first opportunity for achieving happiness. </p>
<p id="dn18:24.1">Next, take someone whose coarse physical, verbal, and mental processes have not died down. After some time they hear the teaching of the noble ones, properly attend to how it applies to them, and practice accordingly. Their coarse physical, verbal, and mental processes die down. That gives rise to pleasure, and more than pleasure, happiness, like the joy that’s born from gladness. This is the second opportunity for achieving happiness. </p>
<p id="dn18:25.1">Next, take someone who doesn’t truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful, what is blameworthy and what is blameless, what should be cultivated and what should not be cultivated, what is inferior and what is superior, and what is on the side of dark and the side of bright. After some time they hear the teaching of the noble ones, properly attend to how it applies to them, and practice accordingly. They truly understand what is skillful and what is unskillful, and so on. Knowing and seeing like this, ignorance is given up and knowledge arises. That gives rise to pleasure, and more than pleasure, happiness, like the joy that’s born from gladness. This is the third opportunity for achieving happiness. </p>
<p id="dn18:25.11">These are the three opportunities for achieving happiness that have been understood by the Buddha.” </p>
<p id="dn18:26.1">That is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spoke. And having spoken about that, he addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three: </p>
<h3 class="subheading">8. Mindfulness Meditation </h3>
<p id="dn18:26.4">“What do the good gods of the Thirty-Three think about how much the Buddha has clearly described the four kinds of mindfulness meditation for achieving what is skillful? What four? </p>
<p id="dn18:26.6">It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body internally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. As they meditate in this way, they become rightly immersed in that, and rightly serene. Then they give rise to knowledge and vision of other people’s bodies externally. </p>
<p id="dn18:26.9">They meditate observing an aspect of feelings internally … Then they give rise to knowledge and vision of other people’s feelings externally. </p>
<p id="dn18:26.11">They meditate observing an aspect of the mind internally … Then they give rise to knowledge and vision of other people’s minds externally. </p>
<p id="dn18:26.13">They meditate observing an aspect of principles internally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. As they meditate in this way, they become rightly immersed in that, and rightly serene. Then they give rise to knowledge and vision of other people’s principles externally. </p>
<p id="dn18:26.16">These are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation that the Buddha has clearly described for achieving what is skillful.” </p>
<p id="dn18:27.1">That is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spoke. And having spoken about that, he addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three: </p>
<h3 class="subheading">9. Seven Prerequisites of Immersion </h3>
<p id="dn18:27.4">“What do the good gods of the Thirty-Three think about how much the Buddha has clearly described the seven prerequisites of immersion for the development and fulfillment of right immersion? What seven? Right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness. Unification of mind with these seven factors as prerequisites is called noble right immersion ‘with its vital conditions’ and ‘with its prerequisites’. </p>
<p id="dn18:27.8">Right view gives rise to right thought. Right thought gives rise to right speech. Right speech gives rise to right action. Right action gives rise to right livelihood. Right livelihood gives rise to right effort. Right effort gives rise to right mindfulness. Right mindfulness gives rise to right immersion. Right immersion gives rise to right knowledge. Right knowledge gives rise to right freedom. </p>
<p id="dn18:27.9">If anything should be rightly described as ‘a teaching that’s well explained by the Buddha, visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves; and the doors to the deathless are flung open,’ it’s this. For the teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves—and the doors of the deathless are flung open. </p>
<p id="dn18:27.12">Whoever has experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and has the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones; and whoever is spontaneously reborn, and is trained in the teaching; in excess of 2,400,000 such Magadhan devotees have passed away having ended three fetters. They’re stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. And there are once-returners here, too. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn18:27.14">And as for other people <br/>who I think have shared in merit—<br/>I couldn’t even number them, <br/>for fear of speaking falsely.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn18:28.1">That is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spoke. And while he was speaking on that topic, this thought came to the great king Vessavaṇa, “It’s incredible, it’s amazing! That there should be such a magnificent Teacher, and such a magnificent exposition of the teaching! And that such achievements of high distinction should be made known!” </p>
<p id="dn18:28.3">And then Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra, knowing what the great king Vessavaṇa was thinking, said to him, “What does Great King Vessavaṇa think? In the past, too, there was such a magnificent Teacher, and such a magnificent exposition of the teaching! And such achievements of high distinction were made known! In the future, too, there will be such a magnificent Teacher, and such a magnificent exposition of the teaching! And such achievements of high distinction will be made known!” </p>
<p id="dn18:29.1">That, sir, is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spoke to the gods of the Thirty-Three. And the great king Vessavaṇa, having heard and learned it in the presence of Brahmā as he was speaking on that topic, informed his own assembly.’” </p>
<p id="dn18:29.2">And the spirit Janavasabha, having heard and learned it in the presence of the great king Vessavaṇa as he was speaking on that topic to his own assembly, informed the Buddha. And the Buddha, having heard and learned it in the presence of the spirit Janavasabha, and also from his own direct knowledge, informed Venerable Ānanda. And Venerable Ānanda, having heard and learned it in the presence of the Buddha, informed the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. And that’s how this spiritual life has become successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans. </p>

<p id="dn19:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. </p>
<p id="dn19:1.3">Then, late at night, the fairy Pañcasikha, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, “Sir, I would tell you of what I heard and learned directly from the gods of the Thirty-Three.” </p>
<p id="dn19:1.5">“Tell me, Pañcasikha,” said the Buddha. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">1. The Council of the Gods </h3>
<p id="dn19:2.1">“Sir, it was more than a few days ago—on the fifteenth day sabbath on the full moon day at the invitation to admonish held at the end of the rainy season—when all the gods of the Thirty-Three were sitting together in the Hall of Justice. A large assembly of gods was sitting all around, and the Four Great Kings were seated at the four quarters. </p>
<p id="dn19:2.3">The Great King Dhataraṭṭha was seated to the east, facing west, in front of his gods. The Great King Virūḷhaka was seated to the south, facing north, in front of his gods. The Great King Virūpakkha was seated to the west, facing east, in front of his gods. The Great King Vessavaṇa was seated to the north, facing south, in front of his gods. </p>
<p id="dn19:2.7">When the gods of the Thirty-Three have a gathering like this, that is how they are seated. After that come our seats. </p>
<p id="dn19:3.1">Sir, those gods who had been recently reborn in the company of the Thirty-Three after leading the spiritual life under the Buddha outshine the other gods in beauty and glory. The gods of the Thirty-Three became uplifted and overjoyed at that, full of rapture and happiness, saying, ‘The heavenly hosts swell, while the demon hosts dwindle!’ </p>
<p id="dn19:3.4">Seeing the joy of those gods, Sakka, lord of gods, celebrated with these verses: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn19:3.5">‘The gods rejoice—<br/>the Thirty-Three with their Lord—<br/>revering the Realized One, <br/>and the natural excellence of the teaching; </p>
<p id="dn19:3.9">and seeing the new gods, <br/>so beautiful and glorious, <br/>who have come here after leading <br/>the spiritual life under the Buddha! </p>
<p id="dn19:3.13">They outshine the others <br/>in beauty, glory, and lifespan. <br/>Here are the distinguished disciples <br/>of he whose wisdom is vast. </p>
<p id="dn19:3.17">Seeing this, they delight—<br/>the Thirty-Three with their Lord—<br/>revering the Realized One, <br/>and the natural excellence of the teaching!’ </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn19:3.21">The gods of the Thirty-Three became even more uplifted and overjoyed at that, full of rapture and happiness, saying, ‘The heavenly hosts swell, while the demon hosts dwindle!’ </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. Eight Genuine Praises </h3>
<p id="dn19:4.1">Seeing the joy of those gods, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed them, ‘Gentlemen, would you like to hear eight genuine praises of the Buddha?’ </p>
<p id="dn19:4.3">‘Indeed we would, sir.’ </p>
<p id="dn19:4.4">Then Sakka proffered these eight genuine praises of the Buddha: </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="dn19:5.1">‘What do the good gods of the Thirty-Three think about how much the Buddha has acted for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans? I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who has such compassion for the world, apart from the Buddha. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="dn19:6.1">Also, the Buddha has explained the teaching well—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves. I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who explains such a relevant teaching, apart from the Buddha. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="dn19:7.1">Also, the Buddha has clearly described what is skillful and what is unskillful, what is blameworthy and what is blameless, what should be cultivated and what should not be cultivated, what is inferior and what is superior, and what is on the side of dark and the side of bright. I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who so clearly describes all these things, apart from the Buddha. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="dn19:8.1">Also, the Buddha has clearly described the practice that leads to extinguishment for his disciples. And extinguishment and the practice come together, as the waters of the Ganges come together and converge with the waters of the Yamuna. I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who so clearly describes the practice that leads to extinguishment for his disciples, apart from the Buddha. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="dn19:9.1">Also, possessions and popularity have accrued to the Buddha, so much that you’d think it would thrill even the aristocrats. But he takes his food free of vanity. I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who takes their food so free of vanity, apart from the Buddha. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="dn19:10.1">Also, the Buddha has gained companions, both trainees who are practicing, and those with defilements ended who have completed their journey. The Buddha is committed to the joy of solitude, but doesn’t send them away. I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, so committed to the joy of solitude, apart from the Buddha. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="dn19:11.1">Also, the Buddha does as he says, and says as he does, thus: he does as he says, and says as he does. I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who so practices in line with the teaching, apart from the Buddha. </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="dn19:12.1">Also, the Buddha has gone beyond doubt and got rid of indecision. He has achieved all he wished for regarding the fundamental purpose of the spiritual life. I don’t see any Teacher, past or present, who has achieved these things, apart from the Buddha.’ </p>
<p id="dn19:12.3">These are the eight genuine praises of the Buddha proffered by Sakka. Hearing them, the gods of the Thirty-Three became even more uplifted and overjoyed. </p>
<p id="dn19:13.1">Then some gods thought, ‘If only four fully awakened Buddhas might arise in the world and teach the Dhamma, just like the Blessed One! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!’ </p>
<p id="dn19:13.4">Other gods thought, ‘Let alone four fully awakened Buddhas; if only three fully awakened Buddhas, or two fully awakened Buddhas might arise in the world and teach the Dhamma, just like the Blessed One! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!’ </p>
<p id="dn19:14.1">When they said this, Sakka said, ‘It’s impossible, gentlemen, for two perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas to arise in the same solar system at the same time. May that Blessed One be healthy and well, and remain with us for a long time! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans!’ </p>
<p id="dn19:14.5">Then the gods of the Thirty-Three, having considered and deliberated on the matter for which they were seated together in the Hall of Justice, advised and instructed the Four Great Kings on the subject. And each stood at their own seat without departing. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn19:14.7">The Kings were instructed, <br/>and heeded good advice. <br/>With clear and peaceful minds, <br/>they stood by their own seats. </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn19:15.1">Then in the northern quarter a magnificent light arose and radiance appeared, surpassing the glory of the gods. Then Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three, ‘As indicated by the signs—light arising and radiance appearing—Brahmā will appear. For this is the precursor for the appearance of Brahmā, namely light arising and radiance appearing.’ </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn19:15.5">As indicated by the signs, <br/>Brahmā will appear. <br/>For this is the sign of Brahmā: <br/>a light vast and great. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="subheading">3. On Sanaṅkumāra </h3>
<p id="dn19:16.1">Then the gods of the Thirty-Three sat in their own seats, saying, ‘We shall find out what has caused that light, and only when we have realized it shall we go to it.’ And the Four Great Kings did likewise. Hearing that, the gods of the Thirty-Three agreed in unison, ‘We shall find out what has caused that light, and only when we have realized it shall we go to it.’ </p>
<p id="dn19:16.7">When Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the Thirty-Three, he does so after manifesting in a solid corporeal form, for the gods of the Thirty-Three aren’t able to see a Brahmā’s normal appearance. When Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the Thirty-Three, he outshines the other gods in beauty and glory, as a golden statue outshines the human form. When Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra appears to the gods of the Thirty-Three, not a single god in that assembly greets him by bowing down or rising up or inviting him to a seat. They all sit silently on their couches with their joined palms raised, thinking, ‘Now Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra will sit on the couch of whatever god he chooses.’ And the god on whose couch Brahmā sits is overjoyed and brimming with happiness, like a king on the day of his coronation. </p>
<p id="dn19:17.3">Seeing the joy of those gods, Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra celebrated with these verses: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn19:17.4">‘The gods rejoice—<br/>the Thirty-Three with their Lord—<br/>revering the Realized One, <br/>and the natural excellence of the teaching; </p>
<p id="dn19:17.8">and seeing the new gods, <br/>so beautiful and glorious, <br/>who have come here after leading <br/>the spiritual life under the Buddha! </p>
<p id="dn19:17.12">They outshine the others <br/>in beauty, glory, and lifespan. <br/>Here are the distinguished disciples <br/>of he whose wisdom is vast. </p>
<p id="dn19:17.16">Seeing this, they delight—<br/>the Thirty-Three with their Lord—<br/>revering the Realized One, <br/>and the natural excellence of the teaching!’ </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn19:18.1">That is the topic on which Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra spoke. And while he was speaking on that topic, his voice had eight qualities: it was clear, comprehensible, charming, audible, lucid, undistorted, deep, and resonant. He makes sure his voice is intelligible as far as the assembly goes, but it doesn’t extend outside the assembly. When someone has a voice like this, they’re said to have the voice of Brahmā. </p>
<p id="dn19:19.1">Then the gods of the Thirty-Three said to Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra, ‘Good, Great Brahmā! Having assessed this, we rejoice. And there are the eight genuine praises of the Buddha spoken by Sakka—having assessed them, too, we rejoice.’ </p>
<h3 class="subheading">4. Eight Genuine Praises </h3>
<p id="dn19:19.6">Then Brahmā said to Sakka, ‘It would be good, lord of gods, if I could also hear the eight genuine praises of the Buddha.’ </p>
<p id="dn19:19.8">Saying, ‘Yes, Great Brahmā,’ Sakka repeated the eight genuine praises for him. </p>
<p id="dn19:28.1">Hearing them, Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra was uplifted and overjoyed, full of rapture and happiness. Then Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra manifested in a solid corporeal form, taking on the appearance of the youth Pañcasikha, and appeared to the gods of the Thirty-Three. Rising into the air, he sat cross-legged in the sky, like a strong man might sit cross-legged on a well-appointed couch or on level ground. There he addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three: </p>
<h3 class="subheading">5. The Story of the Steward </h3>
<p id="dn19:28.8">‘What do the gods of the Thirty-Three think about the extent of the Buddha’s great wisdom? </p>
<p id="dn19:29.1">Once upon a time, there was a king named Disampati. He had a brahmin high priest named the Steward. Disampati’s son was the prince named Reṇu, while the Steward’s son was the student named Jotipāla. There were Reṇu the prince, Jotipāla the student, and six other aristocrats; these eight became friends. </p>
<p id="dn19:29.6">In due course the brahmin Steward passed away. At his passing, King Disampati lamented, “At a time when I have relinquished all my duties to the brahmin Steward and amuse myself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, he passes away!” </p>
<p id="dn19:29.9">When he said this, Prince Reṇu said to him, “Sire, don’t lament too much at the Steward’s passing. He has a son named Jotipāla, who is even more astute and expert than his father. He should manage the affairs that were managed by his father.” </p>
<p id="dn19:29.13">“Is that so, my prince?” </p>
<p id="dn19:29.14">“Yes, sire.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">6. The Story of the Great Steward </h3>
<p id="dn19:30.1">So King Disampati addressed one of his men, “Please, mister, go to the student Jotipāla, and say to him, ‘Best wishes, Jotipāla! You are summoned by King Disampati; he wants to see you.’” </p>
<p id="dn19:30.4">“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied that man, and did as he was asked. Then Jotipāla went to the king and exchanged greetings with him. </p>
<p id="dn19:30.7">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and the king said to him, “May you, Jotipāla, manage my affairs—please don’t turn me down! I shall appoint you to your father’s position, and anoint you as Steward.” </p>
<p id="dn19:30.10">“Yes, sir,” replied Jotipāla. </p>
<p id="dn19:31.1">So the king anointed him as Steward and appointed him to his father’s position. After his appointment, the Steward Jotipāla managed both the affairs that his father had managed, and other affairs that his father had not managed. He organized both the works that his father had organized, and other works that his father had not organized. When people noticed this they said, “The brahmin is indeed a Steward, a Great Steward!” And that’s how the student Jotipāla came to be known as the Great Steward. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">6.1. Dividing the Realm </h4>
<p id="dn19:32.1">Then the Great Steward went to the six aristocrats and said, “King Disampati is old, elderly and senior, advanced in years, and has reached the final stage of life. Who knows how long he has to live? It’s likely that when he passes away the king-makers will anoint Prince Reṇu as king. Come, sirs, go to Prince Reṇu and say, ‘Prince Reṇu, we are your friends, dear, beloved, and cherished. We have shared your joys and sorrows. King Disampati is old, elderly and senior, advanced in years, and has reached the final stage of life. Who knows how long he has to live? It’s likely that when he passes away the king-makers will anoint you as king. If you should gain kingship, share it with us.’” </p>
<p id="dn19:33.1">“Yes, sir,” replied the six aristocrats. They went to Prince Reṇu and put the proposal to him. </p>
<p id="dn19:33.7">The prince replied, “Who else, sirs, in my realm ought to prosper if not you? If I gain kingship, I will share it with you all.” </p>
<p id="dn19:34.1">In due course King Disampati passed away. At his passing, the king-makers anointed Prince Reṇu as king. But after being anointed, King Reṇu amused himself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. </p>
<p id="dn19:34.4">Then the Great Steward went to the six aristocrats and said, “King Disampati has passed away. But after being anointed, King Reṇu amused himself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. Who knows the intoxicating power of sensual pleasures? Come, sirs, go to Prince Reṇu and say, ‘Sir, King Disampati has passed away, and you have been anointed as king. Do you remember what you said?’” </p>
<p id="dn19:34.10">“Yes, sir,” replied the six aristocrats. They went to King Reṇu and said, “Sir, King Disampati has passed away, and you have been anointed as king. Do you remember what you said?” </p>
<p id="dn19:34.12">“I remember, sirs. Who is able to neatly divide into seven equal parts this great land, so broad in the north and narrow as the front of a cart in the south?” </p>
<p id="dn19:34.14">“Who else, sir, if not the Great Steward?” </p>
<p id="dn19:35.1">So King Reṇu addressed one of his men, “Please, mister, go to the brahmin Great Steward and say that King Reṇu summons him.” </p>
<p id="dn19:35.4">“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied that man, and did as he was asked. Then the Great Steward went to the king and exchanged greetings with him. </p>
<p id="dn19:35.7">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and the king said to him, “Come, let the good Steward neatly divide into seven equal parts this great land, so broad in the north and narrow as the front of a cart in the south.” </p>
<p id="dn19:35.9">“Yes, sir,” replied the Great Steward, and did as he was asked. All were set up like the fronts of carts, with King Reṇu’s nation in the center. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn19:36.3">Dantapura for the Kaliṅgas; <br/>Potana for the Assakas; <br/>Mahissati for the Avantis; <br/>Roruka for the Sovīras; </p>
<p id="dn19:36.7">Mithila for the Videhas; <br/>Campā was made for the Aṅgas; <br/>and Varanasi for the Kāsīs: <br/>these were laid out by the Steward. </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn19:36.11">Then those six aristocrats were delighted with their respective gains, having achieved all they wished for, “We have received exactly what we wanted, what we wished for, what we desired, what we yearned for.” </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn19:36.13">Sattabhū and Brahmadatta, <br/>Vessabhū and Bharata, <br/>Reṇu and the two Dhataraṭṭhas: <br/>these are the seven Bhāratas. </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="endsection" id="dn19:36.17">The first recitation section is finished. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">6.2. A Good Reputation </h4>
<p id="dn19:37.1">Then the six aristocrats approached the Great Steward and said, “Steward, just as you are King Reṇu’s friend, dear, beloved, and cherished, you are also our friend. Would you manage our affairs? Please don’t turn us down!” </p>
<p id="dn19:37.5">“Yes, sirs,” replied the Great Steward. Then the Great Steward managed the realms of the seven kings. And he taught seven well-to-do brahmins, and seven hundred bathed initiates to recite the hymns. </p>
<p id="dn19:38.1">After some time he got this good reputation, “The Great Steward sees Brahmā in person! The Great Steward discusses, converses, and consults with Brahmā in person!” </p>
<p id="dn19:38.3">The Great Steward thought, “I have the reputation of seeing Brahmā in person, and discussing with him in person. But I don’t. I have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior, the teachers of teachers, said: ‘Whoever goes on retreat for the four months of the rainy season and practices the absorption on compassion sees Brahmā and discusses with him.’ Why don’t I do that?” </p>
<p id="dn19:39.1">So the Great Steward went to King Reṇu and told him of the situation, saying, “Sir, I wish to go on retreat for the four months of the rainy season and practice the absorption on compassion. No one should approach me, except for the one who brings my meal.” </p>
<p id="dn19:39.9">“Please do so, Steward, at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="dn19:40.1">Then the Great Steward went to the six aristocrats to put the same proposal, and received the same reply. </p>
<p id="dn19:41.1">He also went to the seven well-to-do brahmins and seven hundred bathed initiates and put to them the same proposal, adding, “Sirs, recite the hymns in detail as you have learned and memorized them, and teach each other how to recite.” </p>
<p id="dn19:41.9">And they too said, “Please do so, Steward, at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="dn19:42.1">Then the Great Steward went to his forty equal wives to put the same proposal to them, and received the same reply. </p>
<p id="dn19:43.1">Then the Great Steward had a new meeting hall built to the east of his citadel, where he went on retreat for the four months of the rainy season and practiced the absorption on compassion. And no one approached him except the one who brought him meals. </p>
<p id="dn19:43.3">But then, when the four months had passed, the Great Steward became dissatisfied and anxious, “I have heard that brahmins of the past said that whoever goes on retreat for the four months of the rainy season and practices the absorption on compassion sees Brahmā and discusses with him. But I neither see Brahmā nor discuss with him.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">6.3. A Discussion With Brahmā </h4>
<p id="dn19:44.1">And then Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra, knowing what the Great Steward was thinking, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in the Great Steward’s presence. At that, the Great Steward became frightened, scared, his hair standing on end, as he had never seen such a sight before. So he addressed Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra in verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn19:44.4">“Who might you be, sir, <br/>so beautiful, glorious, majestic? <br/>Not knowing, I ask—<br/>how am I to know who you are?” </p>
<p id="dn19:44.8">“In the Brahmā realm they know me <br/>as ‘The Eternal Youth’. <br/>All the gods know me thus, <br/>and so you should know me, Steward.” </p>
<p id="dn19:44.12">“A Brahmā deserves a seat and water, <br/>foot-salve, and sweet cakes. <br/>Sir, I ask you to please accept <br/>these gifts of hospitality.” </p>
<p id="dn19:44.16">“I accept the gifts of hospitality <br/>of which you speak. <br/>I grant you the opportunity <br/>to ask whatever you desire—<br/>about welfare and benefit in this life, <br/>or happiness in lives to come.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn19:45.1">Then the Great Steward thought, “Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra has granted me an opportunity. Should I ask him about what is beneficial for this life or lives to come?” </p>
<p id="dn19:45.4">Then he thought, “I’m a skilled in what is beneficial for this life, and others even ask me about it. Why don’t I ask Brahmā about the benefit that specifically applies to lives to come?” So he addressed Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra in verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn19:45.8">“I’m in doubt, so I ask Brahmā—<j>who is free of doubt—</j><br/>about things one may learn from another. <br/>Standing on what, training in what <br/>may a mortal reach the deathless Brahmā realm?” </p>
<p id="dn19:45.12">“He among men, O brahmin, <j>has given up possessiveness, </j><br/>become one, compassionate, <br/>free of putrefaction, and refraining from sex. <br/>Standing on that, training in that <br/>a mortal may reach the deathless Brahmā realm.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn19:46.1">“Sir, I understand what ‘giving up possessiveness’ means. It’s when someone gives up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. That’s how I understand ‘giving up possessiveness’. </p>
<p id="dn19:46.4">Sir, I understand what ‘oneness’ means. It’s when someone frequents a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. That’s how I understand ‘oneness’. </p>
<p id="dn19:46.7">Sir, I understand what ‘compassionate’ means. It’s when someone meditates spreading a heart full of compassion to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of compassion to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. That’s how I understand ‘compassionate’. </p>
<p id="dn19:46.10">But I don’t understand what you say about putrefaction. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn19:46.11">What among men, O Brahmā, is putrefaction? <br/>I don’t understand, so tell me, wise one: <br/>wrapped in what do people stink, <br/>headed for hell, shut out of the Brahmā realm?” </p>
<p id="dn19:46.15">“Anger, lies, fraud, and deceit, <br/>miserliness, vanity, jealousy, <br/>desire, stinginess, harassing others, <br/>greed, hate, vanity, and delusion—<br/>those bound to such things have putrefaction; <br/>they’re headed for hell, <j>shut out of the Brahmā realm.” </j></p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn19:46.21">“As I understand what you say about putrefaction, it’s not easy to quell while living at home. I shall go forth from the lay life to homelessness!” </p>
<p id="dn19:46.23">“Please do so, Steward, at your convenience.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">6.4. Informing King Reṇu </h4>
<p id="dn19:47.1">So the Great Steward went to King Reṇu and said, “Sir, please now find another high priest to manage the affairs of state for you. I wish to go forth from the lay life to homelessness. As I understand what Brahmā says about putrefaction, it’s not easy to quell while living at home. I shall go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn19:47.6">I announce to King Reṇu, <br/>the lord of the land: <br/>you must learn how to rule, <br/>for I no longer care for my ministry.” </p>

<p id="dn19:47.16">“I’m lacking no pleasures, <br/>and no-one is harming me. <br/>I’ve heard a non-human voice, <br/>so I no longer care for lay life.” </p>
<p id="dn19:47.20">“What was that non-human like? <br/>What did he say to you, <br/>hearing which you would abandon <br/>our house and all our people?” </p>
<p id="dn19:47.24">“Before entering this retreat, <br/>I only liked to sacrifice. <br/>I kindled the sacred flame, <br/>strewn about with kusa grass. </p>

<h4 class="subheading">6.5. Informing the Six Aristocrats </h4>
<p id="dn19:48.1">Then the Great Steward went to the six aristocrats and said, “Sirs, please now find another high priest to manage the affairs of state for you. I wish to go forth from the lay life to homelessness. As I understand what Brahmā says about putrefaction, it’s not easy to quell while living at home. I shall go forth from the lay life to homelessness!” </p>
<p id="dn19:49.1">Then the six aristocrats withdrew to one side and thought up a plan, “These brahmins are really greedy for wealth. Why don’t we try to persuade him with wealth?” </p>
<p id="dn19:49.4">They returned to the Great Steward and said, “In these seven kingdoms there is abundant wealth. We’ll get you as much as you want.” </p>
<p id="dn19:49.6">“Enough, sirs. I already have abundant wealth, owing to my lords. Giving up all that, I shall go forth.” </p>
<p id="dn19:49.10">Then the six aristocrats withdrew to one side and thought up a plan, “These brahmins are really greedy for women. Why don’t we try to persuade him with women?” </p>
<p id="dn19:49.13">They returned to the Great Steward and said, “In these seven kingdoms there are many women. We’ll get you as many as you want.” </p>
<p id="dn19:49.15">“Enough, sirs. I already have forty equal wives. Giving up all them, I shall go forth.” </p>

</blockquote>
<p id="dn19:51.1">“Well then, sir, please wait for seven years. When seven years have passed, we shall go forth with you. Your destiny shall be ours.” </p>
<p id="dn19:51.3">“Seven years is too long, sirs. I cannot wait that long. Who knows what will happen to the living? We are heading to the next life. We must be thoughtful and wake up! We must do what’s good and lead the spiritual life, for no-one born can escape death. I shall go forth.” </p>
<p id="dn19:52.1">“Well then, sir, please wait for six years, five years, four years, three years, two years, one year, seven months, six months, five months, four months, three months, two months, one month, or even a fortnight.

<p id="dn19:55.1">“A fortnight is too long, sirs. I cannot wait that long. Who knows what will happen to the living? We are heading to the next life. We must be thoughtful and wake up!

<p id="dn19:55.7">“A week is not too long, sirs. I will wait that long.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">6.6. Informing the Brahmins </h4>
<p id="dn19:56.1">Then the Great Steward also went to the seven well-to-do brahmins and seven hundred bathed initiates and said, “Sirs, please now find another teacher to teach you to recite the hymns. I wish to go forth from the lay life to homelessness. As I understand what Brahmā says about putrefaction, it’s not easy to quell while living at home. I shall go forth from the lay life to homelessness.” </p>
<p id="dn19:56.6">“Please don’t go forth from the lay life to homelessness! The life of one gone forth is of little influence or profit, whereas the life of a brahmin is of great influence and profit.” </p>
<p id="dn19:56.9">“Please, sirs, don’t say that. Who has greater influence and profit than myself? For now I am like a king to kings, like Brahmā to brahmins, like a deity to householders. Giving up all that, I shall go forth. As I understand what Brahmā says about putrefaction, it’s not easy to quell while living at home. I shall go forth from the lay life to homelessness.” </p>
<p id="dn19:56.15">“If the Steward is going forth from the lay life to homelessness, we shall do so too. Your destiny shall be ours.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">6.7. Informing the Wives </h4>
<p id="dn19:57.1">Then the Great Steward went to his forty equal wives and said, “Ladies, please do whatever you wish, whether returning to your own families, or finding another husband. I wish to go forth from the lay life to homelessness. As I understand what Brahmā says about putrefaction, it’s not easy to quell while living at home. I shall go forth from the lay life to homelessness.” </p>
<p id="dn19:57.6">“You are the only family we want! You are the only husband we want! If you are going forth from the lay life to homelessness, we shall do so too. Your destiny shall be ours.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">6.8. The Great Steward Goes Forth </h4>
<p id="dn19:58.1">When a week had passed, the Great Steward shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. And when he had gone forth, the seven anointed aristocrat kings, the seven brahmins with seven hundred initiates, the forty equal wives, and many thousands of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and many harem women shaved off their hair and beards, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="dn19:58.3">Escorted by that assembly, the Great Steward wandered on tour among the villages, towns, and capital cities. And at that time, whenever he arrived at a village or town, he was like a king to kings, like Brahmā to brahmins, like a deity to householders. And whenever people sneezed or tripped over they’d say: “Homage to the Great Steward! Homage to the high priest for the seven!” </p>
<p id="dn19:59.1">And the Great Steward meditated spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, he spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. He meditated spreading a heart full of compassion … rejoicing … equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, he spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. And he taught his disciples the path to rebirth in the company of Brahmā. </p>
<p id="dn19:60.1">Those of his disciples who completely understood the Great Steward’s instructions, at the breaking up of the body, after death, were reborn in the Brahmā realm. Of those disciples who only partly understood the Great Steward’s instructions, some were reborn in the company of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others, while some were reborn in the company of the Gods Who Love to Create, or the Joyful Gods, or the Gods of Yama, or the Gods of the Thirty-Three, or the Gods of the Four Great Kings. And at the very least they swelled the hosts of the fairies. </p>
<p id="dn19:60.10">And so the going forth of all those gentlemen was not in vain, was not wasted, but was fruitful and fertile.’ </p>
<p id="dn19:60.11">Do you remember this, Blessed One?” </p>
<p id="dn19:61.1">“I remember, Pañcasikha. I myself was the brahmin Great Steward at that time. And I taught those disciples the path to rebirth in the company of Brahmā. But that spiritual path of mine doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. It only leads as far as rebirth in the Brahmā realm. </p>
<p id="dn19:61.5">But this spiritual path does lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. And what is the spiritual path that leads to extinguishment? It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. This is the spiritual path that leads to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. </p>
<p id="dn19:62.1">Those of my disciples who completely understand my instructions realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. </p>
<p id="dn19:62.2">Of those disciples who only partly understand my instructions, some, with the ending of the five lower fetters, become reborn spontaneously. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. </p>
<p id="dn19:62.3">Some, with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, become once-returners. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. </p>
<p id="dn19:62.4">And some, with the ending of three fetters, become stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. </p>
<p id="dn19:62.5">And so the going forth of all those gentlemen was not in vain, was not wasted, but was fruitful and fertile.” </p>
<p id="dn19:62.6">That is what the Buddha said. Delighted, the fairy Pañcasikha approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there. </p>

<h2 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">DN 20</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">The Great Congregation </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Mahāsamayasutta</span></h2>
<p id="dn20:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Great Wood, together with a large Saṅgha of around five hundred mendicants, all of whom were perfected ones. And most of the deities from ten solar systems had gathered to see the Buddha and the Saṅgha of mendicants. </p>
<p id="dn20:2.1">Then four deities of the Pure Abodes, aware of what was happening, thought: “Why don’t we go to the Buddha and each recite a verse in his presence?” </p>
<p id="dn20:3.1">Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from the Pure Abodes and reappeared in front of the Buddha. They bowed to the Buddha and stood to one side. Standing to one side, one deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn20:3.4">“There’s a great congregation in the woods, <br/>a host of gods have assembled. <br/>We’ve come to this righteous congregation <br/>to see the invincible Saṅgha!” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn20:3.8">Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn20:3.9">“The mendicants there are immersed in samādhi, <br/>they’ve straightened out their own minds. <br/>Like a charioteer who has taken the reins, <br/>the astute ones protect their senses.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn20:3.13">Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn20:3.14">“Having cut the stake and cut the bar, <br/>they’re unstirred, with boundary pillar uprooted. <br/>They live pure and immaculate, <br/>the young dragons tamed by the seer.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn20:3.18">Then another deity recited this verse in the Buddha’s presence: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn20:3.19">“Anyone who has gone to the Buddha for refuge <br/>won’t go to a plane of loss. <br/>After giving up this human body, <br/>they swell the hosts of gods.” </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="subheading">1. The Gathering of Deities </h3>
<p id="dn20:4.1">Then the Buddha said to the mendicants: </p>
<p id="dn20:4.2">“Mendicants, most of the deities from ten solar systems have gathered to see the Realized One and the mendicant Saṅgha. The Buddhas of the past had, and the Buddhas of the future will have, gatherings of deities that are at most like the gathering for me now. I shall declare the names of the heavenly hosts; I shall extol the names of the heavenly hosts; I shall teach the names of the heavenly hosts. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="dn20:4.9">“Yes, sir,” they replied. </p>
<p id="dn20:4.10">The Buddha said this: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn20:5.1">“I shall invoke a paean of praise! <br/>Where the earth-gods dwell, <br/>there, in mountain caves, <br/>resolute and composed, </p>
<p id="dn20:5.5">dwell many like lonely lions, <br/>who have mastered their fears. <br/>Their minds are bright and pure, <br/>clear and undisturbed.” </p>
<p id="dn20:5.9">The teacher knew that over five hundred <br/>were in the wood at Kapilavatthu. <br/>Therefore he addressed <br/>the disciples who love the teaching: </p>
<p id="dn20:5.13">“The heavenly hosts have come forth; <br/>mendicants, you should be aware of them.” <br/>Those monks became keen, <br/>hearing the Buddha’s instruction. </p>
<p id="dn20:6.1">Knowledge manifested in them, <br/>seeing those non-human beings. <br/>Some saw a hundred, <br/>a thousand, even seventy thousand, </p>
<p id="dn20:6.5">while some saw a hundred thousand <br/>non-human beings. <br/>But some saw an endless number <br/>spread out in every direction. </p>
<p id="dn20:6.9">And all that was known <br/>and distinguished by the Seer. <br/>Therefore he addressed <br/>the disciples who love the teaching: </p>
<p id="dn20:6.13">“The heavenly hosts have come forth; <br/>mendicants, you should be aware of them. <br/>I shall extol them for you, <br/>with lyrics in proper order. </p>
<p id="dn20:7.1">There are seven thousand spirits, <br/>earth-gods of Kapilavatthu. <br/>They’re powerful and brilliant, <br/>so beautiful and glorious. <br/>Rejoicing, they’ve come forth <br/>to the meeting of mendicants in the wood. </p>
<p id="dn20:7.7">From the Himalayas there are six thousand <br/>spirits of different colors. <br/>They’re powerful and brilliant, <br/>so beautiful and glorious. <br/>Rejoicing, they’ve come forth <br/>to the meeting of mendicants in the wood. </p>
<p id="dn20:7.13">From Mount Sātā there are three thousand <br/>spirits of different colors. <br/>They’re powerful and brilliant, <br/>so beautiful and glorious. <br/>Rejoicing, they’ve come forth <br/>to the meeting of mendicants in the wood. </p>
<p id="dn20:7.19">And thus there are sixteen thousand <br/>spirits of different colors. <br/>They’re powerful and brilliant, <br/>so beautiful and glorious. <br/>Rejoicing, they’ve come forth <br/>to the meeting of mendicants in the wood. </p>
<p id="dn20:8.1">From Vessamittā there are five hundred <br/>spirits of different colors. <br/>They’re powerful and brilliant, <br/>so beautiful and glorious. <br/>Rejoicing, they’ve come forth <br/>to the meeting of mendicants in the wood. </p>
<p id="dn20:8.7">And there’s Kumbhīra of Rājagaha, <br/>whose home is on Mount Vepulla. <br/>Attended by more than <br/>a hundred thousand spirits, <br/>Kumbhīra of Rājagaha <br/>also came to the meeting in the wood. </p>
<p id="dn20:9.1">King Dhataraṭṭha rules <br/>the eastern quarter. <br/>Lord of the fairies, <br/>he’s a great king, glorious. </p>
<p id="dn20:9.5">And he has many mighty sons <br/>all of them named Indra. <br/>They’re powerful and brilliant, <br/>so beautiful and glorious. <br/>Rejoicing, they’ve come forth <br/>to the meeting of mendicants in the wood. </p>
<p id="dn20:9.11">King Virūḷha rules <br/>the southern quarter. <br/>Lord of the goblins, <br/>he’s a great king, glorious. </p>
<p id="dn20:9.15">And he has many mighty sons <br/>all of them named Indra. <br/>They’re powerful and brilliant, <br/>so beautiful and glorious. <br/>Rejoicing, they’ve come forth <br/>to the meeting of mendicants in the wood. </p>

<p id="dn20:9.25">And he has many mighty sons <br/>all of them named Indra. <br/>They’re powerful and brilliant, <br/>so beautiful and glorious. <br/>Rejoicing, they’ve come forth <br/>to the meeting of mendicants in the wood. </p>
<p id="dn20:9.31">King Kuvera rules <br/>the northern quarter. <br/>Lord of spirits, <br/>he’s a great king, glorious. </p>
<p id="dn20:9.35">And he has many mighty sons <br/>all of them named Indra. <br/>They’re powerful and brilliant, <br/>so beautiful and glorious. <br/>Rejoicing, they’ve come forth <br/>to the meeting of mendicants in the wood. </p>
<p id="dn20:9.41">Dhataraṭṭha in the east, <br/>Virūḷhaka to the south, <br/>Virūpakkha to the west, <br/>and Kuvera in the north. </p>
<p id="dn20:9.45">These Four Great Kings, <br/>all around in the four quarters, <br/>stood there dazzling <br/>in the wood at Kapilavatthu. </p>
<p id="dn20:10.1">Their deceitful bondservants came, <br/>so treacherous and crafty—<br/>the deceivers Kuṭeṇḍu, Viṭeṇḍu, <br/>with Viṭucca and Viṭuḍa. </p>
<p id="dn20:10.5">And Candana and Kāmaseṭṭha, <br/>Kinnughaṇḍu and Nighaṇḍu, <br/>Panāda and Opamañña, <br/>and Mātali, the god’s charioteer. </p>
<p id="dn20:10.9">Cittasena the fairy came too, <br/>and the kings Nala and Janesabha, <br/>as well as Pañcasikha, <br/>Timbaru, and Suriyavacchasā. </p>
<p id="dn20:10.13">These and other kings there were, <br/>the fairies with their kings. <br/>Rejoicing, they’ve come forth <br/>to the meeting of mendicants in the wood. </p>
<p id="dn20:11.1">Then came dragons from Nābhasa, <br/>and Vesālī, with the Tacchakas. <br/>The Kambalas and Assataras came <br/>from Pāyāga with their kin. </p>
<p id="dn20:11.5">From Yamunā the Dhataraṭṭha <br/>dragons came, so glorious. <br/>And Erāvaṇa the great dragon <br/>also came to the meeting in the wood. </p>
<p id="dn20:11.9">Those who seize the dragon kings by force—<br/>divine, twice-born birds with piercing vision—<br/>swoop down to the wood from the sky; <br/>their name is ‘Rainbow Phoenix’. </p>
<p id="dn20:11.13">But the dragon kings remained fearless, <br/>for the Buddha kept them safe from the phoenixes. <br/>Introducing each other with gentle words, <br/>the dragons and phoenixes took the Buddha as refuge. </p>
<p id="dn20:12.1">Defeated by Vajirahattha, <br/>the demons live in the ocean. <br/>They’re brothers of Vāsava, <br/>powerful and glorious. </p>
<p id="dn20:12.5">There’s the terrifying Kālakañjas, <br/>the Dānaveghasa demons, <br/>Vepacitti and Sucitti, <br/>Pahārāda with Namuci, </p>
<p id="dn20:12.9">and a hundred of Bali’s sons, <br/>all named after Veroca. <br/>Bali’s army armed themselves <br/>and went up to the auspicious Rāhu, saying: <br/>‘Now is the time, sir, <br/>for the meeting of mendicants in the wood.’ </p>
<p id="dn20:13.1">The gods of Water and Earth, <br/>and Fire and Wind came there. <br/>The Varuṇa and Vāruṇa gods, <br/>and Soma together with Yasa. </p>
<p id="dn20:13.5">A host of the gods of Love <br/>and Compassion came, so glorious. <br/>These ten hosts of gods <br/>shone in all different colors. </p>
<p id="dn20:13.9">They’re powerful and brilliant, <br/>so beautiful and glorious. <br/>Rejoicing, they’ve come forth <br/>to the meeting of mendicants in the wood. </p>
<p id="dn20:14.1">The Veṇhu and Sahali gods, <br/>and Asama, and the twin Yamas came. <br/>The gods living on the moon came, <br/>with the Moon before them. </p>
<p id="dn20:14.5">The gods living on the sun came, <br/>with the Sun before them. <br/>And with the stars before them <br/>came the silly gods of clouds. </p>
<p id="dn20:14.9">And Sakka came, the stronghold-giver, <br/>known as Vāsava, the first of the Vasus. <br/>These ten hosts of gods <br/>shone in all different colors. </p>
<p id="dn20:14.13">They’re powerful and brilliant, <br/>so beautiful and glorious. <br/>Rejoicing, they’ve come forth <br/>to the meeting of mendicants in the wood. </p>
<p id="dn20:15.1">Then came the Sahabhū gods, <br/>blazing like a crested flame; <br/>and the Ariṭṭhakas and Rojas too, <br/>and the gods hued blue as flax. </p>
<p id="dn20:15.5">The Varuṇas and Sahadhammas, <br/>the Accutas and Anejakas, <br/>the Sūleyyas and Ruciras all came, <br/>as did the Vāsavanesi gods. <br/>These ten hosts of gods <br/>shone in all different colors. </p>
<p id="dn20:15.11">They’re powerful and brilliant, <br/>so beautiful and glorious. <br/>Rejoicing, they’ve come forth <br/>to the meeting of mendicants in the wood. </p>
<p id="dn20:16.1">The Samānas, Mahāsamānas, <br/>Mānusas, and Mānusuttamas all came, <br/>and the gods depraved by play, <br/>and those who are malevolent. </p>
<p id="dn20:16.5">Then came the Hari gods, <br/>and the Lohitavāsīs. <br/>The Pāragas and Mahāpāragas came, <br/>such glorious gods. <br/>These ten hosts of gods <br/>shone in all different colors. </p>
<p id="dn20:16.11">They’re powerful and brilliant, <br/>so beautiful and glorious. <br/>Rejoicing, they’ve come forth <br/>to the meeting of mendicants in the wood. </p>
<p id="dn20:17.1">The Sukkas, Karumhas, and Aruṇas <br/>came along with the Veghanasas. <br/>And the Odātagayhas came as chiefs <br/>of the Vicakkhaṇa gods. </p>
<p id="dn20:17.5">The Sadāmattas and Hāragajas, <br/>and the glorious Missakas; <br/>Pajjuna came thundering, <br/>he who rains on all quarters. </p>
<p id="dn20:17.9">These ten hosts of gods <br/>shone in all different colors. <br/>They’re powerful and brilliant, <br/>so beautiful and glorious. <br/>Rejoicing, they’ve come forth <br/>to the meeting of mendicants in the wood. </p>
<p id="dn20:18.1">The Khemiyas, Tusitas, Yāmas, <br/>and the glorious Kaṭṭhakas came; <br/>The Lambītakas, Lāmaseṭṭhas, <br/>those called the Jotis and Āsavas. <br/>The Gods Who Love to Create came too, <br/>and those who delight in the Creations of Others. </p>
<p id="dn20:18.7">These ten hosts of gods <br/>shone in all different colors. <br/>They’re powerful and brilliant, <br/>so beautiful and glorious. <br/>Rejoicing, they’ve come forth <br/>to the meeting of mendicants in the wood. </p>
<p id="dn20:19.1">These sixty hosts of gods <br/>shone in all different colors. <br/>They came in order of their names, <br/>these and others likewise, thinking: </p>
<p id="dn20:19.5">‘We shall see those rid of rebirth, kind, <br/>the undefiled ones who have crossed the flood, <br/>and the dragon who brought them across, <br/>who like the Moon has overcome darkness.’ </p>
<p id="dn20:20.1">Subrahmā and Paramatta came, <br/>with sons of those powerful ones. <br/>Sanaṅkumāra and Tissa <br/>also came to the meeting in the wood. </p>
<p id="dn20:20.5">Of a thousand Brahmā realms, <br/>the Great Brahmā stands forth. <br/>He has arisen, resplendent, <br/>his formidable body so glorious. </p>
<p id="dn20:20.9">The ten Issarās came there, <br/>each one of them wielding power, <br/>and in the middle of them came <br/>Hārita with his following.” </p>
<p id="dn20:21.1">When they had all come forth—<br/>the gods with their Lord, and the Brahmās—<br/>Māra’s army came forth too: <br/>see the stupidity of the Dark Lord! </p>
<p id="dn20:21.5">“Come, seize them and bind them,” he said, <br/>“let them be bound by desire! <br/>Surround them on all sides, <br/>don’t let any escape!” </p>
<p id="dn20:21.9">And so there the great general <br/>sent forth his dark army. <br/>He struck the ground with his fist <br/>to make a horrifying sound </p>
<p id="dn20:21.13">like a storm cloud shedding rain, <br/>thundering and flashing. <br/>But then he retreated, <br/>furious, out of control. </p>
<p id="dn20:22.1">And all that was known <br/>and distinguished by the Seer. <br/>Therefore he addressed <br/>the disciples who love the teaching: </p>
<p id="dn20:22.5">“Māra’s army has arrived; <br/>mendicants, you should be aware of them.” <br/>Those monks became keen, <br/>hearing the Buddha’s instruction. <br/>The army fled from those free of passion, <br/>and not a single hair was stirred! </p>
<p id="dn20:22.11">“All are triumphant in battle, <br/>so fearless and glorious. <br/>They rejoice with all the spirits, <br/>the disciples well-known among men.” </p>

<p id="dn21:1.1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans; east of Rājagaha there’s a brahmin village named Ambasaṇḍā, north of which, on Mount Vediyaka, is the Indasāla cave. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.1.3">Now at that time Sakka, the lord of gods, became eager to see the Buddha. He thought, “Where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?” </p>
<p id="dn21:1.1.6">He saw that the Buddha was at the Indasāla cave, and addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three, “Good sirs, the Buddha is staying in the land of the Magadhans at the Indasāla cave. What if we were to go and see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?” </p>
<p id="dn21:1.1.10">“Yes, lord,” replied the gods. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.2.1">Then Sakka addressed the fairy Pañcasikha, “Dear Pañcasikha, the Buddha is staying in the land of the Magadhans at the Indasāla cave. What if we were to go and see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?” </p>
<p id="dn21:1.2.4">“Yes, lord,” replied the fairy Pañcasikha. Taking his arched harp made from the pale timber of wood-apple, he went as Sakka’s attendant. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.2.5">Then Sakka went at the head of a retinue consisting of the gods of the Thirty-Three and the fairy Pañcasikha. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the heaven of the gods of the Thirty-Three and landed on Mount Vediyaka north of Ambasaṇḍā. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.3.1">Now at that time a dazzling light appeared over Mount Vediyaka and Ambasaṇḍā, as happens through the glory of the gods. People in the villages round about, terrified, shocked, and awestruck, said, “Mount Vediyaka must be on fire today, blazing and burning! Oh why has such a dazzling light appeared over Mount Vediyaka and Ambasaṇḍā?” </p>
<p id="dn21:1.4.1">Then Sakka addressed the fairy Pañcasikha, “My dear Pañcasikha, it’s hard for one like me to get near the Realized Ones while they are on retreat practicing absorption, enjoying absorption. But if you were to charm the Buddha first, then I could go to see him.” </p>
<p id="dn21:1.4.4">“Yes, lord,” replied the fairy Pañcasikha. Taking his arched harp made from the pale timber of wood-apple, he went to the Indasāla cave. When he had drawn near, he stood to one side, thinking, “This is neither too far nor too near; and he’ll hear my voice.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">1. Pañcasikha’s Song </h3>
<p id="dn21:1.4.8">Standing to one side, Pañcasikha played his arched harp, and sang these verses on the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the perfected ones, and sensual love. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn21:1.5.1">“My lady Suriyavaccasā, oh my Sunshine—<br/>I pay homage to your father Timbaru, <br/>through whom was born a lady so fine, <br/>to fill me with a joy I never knew. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.5.5">As sweet as a breeze to one who’s sweating, <br/>or when thirsty, a sweet and cooling drink, <br/>so dear is your shining beauty to me, <br/>just like the teaching is to all the saints! </p>
<p id="dn21:1.5.9">Like a cure when you’re struck by fever dire, <br/>or food to ease the hunger pain, <br/>come on, darling, please put out my fire, <br/>quench me like water on a flame. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.5.13">As elephants burning in the heat of summer, <br/>sink down in a lotus pond to rest, <br/>so cool, full of petals and of pollen—<br/>that’s how I would plunge into your breast. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.5.17">Like elephants bursting bonds in rutting season, <br/>beating off the pricks of lance and pikes—<br/>I just don’t understand what is the reason <br/>I’m so crazy for your shapely thighs! </p>
<p id="dn21:1.5.21">For you, my heart is full of passion, <br/>I’m in an altered state of mind. <br/>There is no going back, I’m just not able, <br/>I’m like a fish that’s hooked up on the line. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.5.25">Come on, my darling, hold me, fair of thighs! <br/>Embrace me, with your so bashful eyes! <br/>Take me in your arms, my lovely lady, <br/>that’s all I’d ever want or could desire. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.5.29">Ah, then my desire was such a small thing, <br/>my sweet, with your curling wavy hair; <br/>now, like to arahants an offering, <br/>it’s grown so very much from there. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.5.33">Whatever the merit I have forged <br/>by giving to such perfected beings—<br/>may that, my altogether gorgeous, <br/>ripen in togetherness with you. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.5.37">Whatever the merit I have forged <br/>in this vast territory, <br/>may that, my altogether gorgeous, <br/>ripen in togetherness with you. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.5.41">Absorbed, the Sakyan meditates, <br/>unified, alert, and mindful, <br/>the sage seeks the deathless state—<br/>like me, oh my Sunshine, aiming for you! </p>
<p id="dn21:1.5.45">And just like the sage would be rejoicing, <br/>were he to awaken to the truth, <br/>so I’d be rejoicing, lady, <br/>were I to end up as one with you. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.5.49">If Sakka were to grant me just one wish, <br/>as Lord of the holy Thirty-Three, <br/>my darling, you’re the only one I’d wish for, <br/>so strong is the love I hold for you. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.5.53">Like a freshly blossoming sal tree <br/>is your father, my lady so wise. <br/>I pay homage to him, bowing down humbly, <br/>to he whose daughter is of such a kind.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn21:1.6.1">When Pañcasikha had spoken, the Buddha said to him, “Pañcasikha, the sound of the strings and the sound of your voice blend well together, so that neither overpowers the other. But when did you compose these verses on the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the perfected ones, and sensual love?” </p>
<p id="dn21:1.6.5">“This one time, sir, when you were first awakened, you were staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. And at that time I was in love with the lady named Bhaddā Suriyavacchasā, the daughter of the fairy king Timbaru. But the sister desired another—it was Mātali the charioteer’s son named Sikhaḍḍī who she loved. Since I couldn’t win that sister by any means, I took my arched harp to Timbaru’s home, where I played those verses. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.7.10">When I finished, Suriyavacchasā said to me, ‘Dear sir, I have not personally seen the Buddha. But I did hear about him when I went to dance for the gods of the Thirty-Three in the Hall of Justice. Since you extol the Buddha, let us meet up today.’ And that’s when I met up with that sister. But we have not met since.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. The Approach of Sakka </h3>
<p id="dn21:1.8.1">Then Sakka, lord of gods, thought, “Pañcasikha is exchanging pleasantries with the Buddha.” </p>
<p id="dn21:1.8.3">So he addressed Pañcasikha, “My dear Pañcasikha, please bow to the Buddha for me, saying: ‘Sir, Sakka, lord of gods, with his ministers and retinue, bows with his head at your feet.’” </p>
<p id="dn21:1.8.6">“Yes, lord,” replied Pañcasikha. He bowed to the Buddha and said, “Sir, Sakka, lord of gods, with his ministers and retinue, bows with his head at your feet.” </p>
<p id="dn21:1.8.8">“So may Sakka with his ministers and retinue be happy, Pañcasikha,” said the Buddha, “for all want to be happy—whether gods, humans, demons, dragons, fairies, or any of the other diverse creatures there may be.” </p>
<p id="dn21:1.8.10">For that is how the Realized Ones salute such illustrious spirits. And being saluted by the Buddha, Sakka entered the Indasāla cave, bowed to the Buddha, and stood to one side. And the gods of the Thirty-Three did likewise, as did Pañcasikha. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.9.1">And at that time the uneven places were evened out, the cramped places were opened up, the darkness vanished in the cave and light appeared, as happens through the glory of the gods. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.9.2">Then the Buddha said to Sakka, “It’s incredible and amazing that you, the venerable Kosiya, who has so many duties and so much to do, should come here.” </p>
<p id="dn21:1.9.4">“For a long time I’ve wanted to come and see the Buddha, but I wasn’t able, being prevented by my many duties and responsibilities for the gods of the Thirty-Three. This one time, sir, the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the frankincense-tree hut. Then I went to Sāvatthī to see the Buddha. But at that time the Buddha was sitting immersed in some kind of meditation. And a divine maiden of Great King Vessavaṇa named Bhūjati was attending on the Buddha, standing there paying homage to him with joined palms. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.10.2">So I said to her, ‘Sister, please bow to the Buddha for me, saying: “Sir, Sakka, lord of gods, with his ministers and retinue, bows with his head at your feet.”’ </p>
<p id="dn21:1.10.5">When I said this, she said to me, ‘It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha, as he’s in retreat.’ </p>
<p id="dn21:1.10.8">‘Well then, sister, please convey my message when the Buddha emerges from that immersion.’ I hope that sister bowed to you? Do you remember what she said?” </p>
<p id="dn21:1.10.12">“She did bow, lord of gods, and I remember what she said. I also remember that it was the sound of your chariot wheels that pulled me out of that immersion.” </p>
<p id="dn21:1.11.1">“Sir, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the gods who were reborn in the host of the Thirty-Three before me: ‘When a Realized One arises in the world, perfected and fully awakened, the heavenly hosts swell, while the demon hosts dwindle.’ And I have seen this with my own eyes. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.1. The Story of Gopikā </h4>
<p id="dn21:1.11.5">Right here in Kapilavatthu there was a Sakyan lady named Gopikā who had confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and had fulfilled her ethics. Losing her attachment to femininity, she developed masculinity. When her body broke up, after death, she was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. In the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three she became one of my sons. There they knew him as the god Gopaka. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.11.10">Meanwhile three others, mendicants who had led the spiritual life under the Buddha, were reborn in the inferior fairy realm. There they amused themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, and became my servants and attendants. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.11.12">At that, Gopaka scolded them, ‘Where on earth were you at, good sirs, when you heard the Buddha’s teaching! For while I was still a woman I had confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and had fulfilled my ethics. I lost my attachment to femininity and developed masculinity. When my body broke up, after death, I was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. In the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three I became one of Sakka’s sons. Here they know me as the god Gopaka. But you, having led the spiritual life under the Buddha, were reborn in the inferior fairy realm.’ </p>
<p id="dn21:1.11.19">When scolded by Gopaka, two of those gods in that very life gained mindfulness leading to the host of Brahmā’s Ministers. But one god remained attached to sensuality. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn21:1.12.1">‘I was a laywoman disciple of the seer, <br/>and my name was Gopikā. <br/>I was devoted to the Buddha and the teaching, <br/>and I faithfully served the Saṅgha. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.12.5">Because of the excellence of the Buddha’s teaching, <br/>I’m now a mighty, splendid son of Sakka, <br/>reborn among the Three and Thirty. <br/>And here they know me as Gopaka. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.12.9">Then I saw some mendicants who I’d seen before, <br/>dwelling in the host of fairies. <br/>When I used to be a human, <br/>they were disciples of Gotama. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.12.13">I served them with food and drink, <br/>and clasped their feet in my own home. <br/>Where on earth were they at <br/>when they learned the Buddha’s teachings? </p>
<p id="dn21:1.12.17">For each must know for themselves the teaching <br/>so well-taught, realized by the seer. <br/>I was one who followed you, <br/>having heard the fine words of the noble ones. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.12.21">I’m now a mighty, splendid son of Sakka, <br/>reborn among the Three and Thirty. <br/>But you followed the best of men, <br/>and led the supreme spiritual life, </p>
<p id="dn21:1.12.25">but still you’re born in this lesser realm, <br/>a rebirth not befitting. <br/>It’s a sorry sight I see, good sirs, <br/>fellow Buddhists in a lesser realm. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.12.29">Reborn in the host of fairies, <br/>you only wait upon the gods. <br/>Meanwhile, I dwelt in a house—<br/>but see my distinction now! </p>
<p id="dn21:1.12.33">Having been a woman now I’m a male god, <br/>blessed with heavenly sensual pleasures.’ <br/>Scolded by that disciple of Gotama, <br/>when they understood Gopaka, <j>they were struck with urgency. </j></p>
<p id="dn21:1.12.37">‘Let’s strive, let’s try hard—<br/>we won’t serve others any more!’ <br/>Two of them roused up energy, <br/>recalling the Buddha’s instructions. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.12.41">Right away they became dispassionate, <br/>seeing the drawbacks in sensual pleasures. <br/>The fetters and bonds of sensual pleasures—<br/>the ties of the Wicked One so hard to break—</p>
<p id="dn21:1.12.45">they burst them like a bull elephant his ropes, <br/>and passed right over the Thirty-Three. <br/>The gods with Indra and Pajāpati <br/>were all gathered in the Hall of Justice. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.12.49">As they sat there, they passed over them, <br/>the heroes desireless, practicing purity. <br/>Seeing them, Vāsava was struck with urgency; <br/>the master of gods in the midst of the group said, </p>
<p id="dn21:1.12.53">‘These were born in the lesser fairy realm, <br/>but now they pass us by!’ <br/>Heeding the speech of one so moved, <br/>Gopaka addressed Vāsava, </p>
<p id="dn21:1.12.57">‘There is a Buddha, a lord of men, in the world. <br/>Known as the Sakyan Sage, he’s mastered the senses. <br/>Those sons of his were bereft of mindfulness; <br/>but when scolded by me they gained it back. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.12.61">Of the three, there is one who remains <br/>dwelling in the host of fairies. <br/>But two, recollecting the path to awakening, <br/>serene, spurn even the gods.’ </p>
<p id="dn21:1.12.65">The teaching’s explained in such a way <br/>that not a single disciple doubts it. <br/>We venerate the Buddha, the victor, lord of men, <br/>who has crossed the flood and cut off doubt. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.12.69">They attained to distinction fitting the extent <br/>to which they understood the teaching here. <br/>Two of them mastered the distinction of <br/>the host of Brahmā’s Ministers. </p>
<p id="dn21:1.12.73">We have come here, dear sir, <br/>to realize this same teaching. <br/>If the Buddha would give me a chance, <br/>I would ask a question, dear sir.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn21:1.13.1">Then the Buddha thought, “For a long time now this spirit has led a pure life. Any question he asks me will be beneficial, not useless. And he will quickly understand any answer I give to his question.” </p>
<p id="dn21:1.13.4">So the Buddha addressed Sakka in verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn21:1.13.5">“Ask me your question, Vāsava, <br/>whatever you want. <br/>I’ll solve each and every <br/>question you have.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p class="endsection" id="dn21:1.13.9">The first recitation section is finished. </p>
<p id="dn21:2.1.1">Having been granted an opportunity by the Buddha, Sakka asked the first question. </p>
<p id="dn21:2.1.2">“Dear sir, what fetters bind the gods, humans, demons, dragons, fairies—and any of the other diverse creatures—so that, though they wish to be free of enmity, violence, hostility, and hate, they still have enmity, violence, hostility, and hate?” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.1.4">Such was Sakka’s question to the Buddha. And the Buddha answered him: </p>
<p id="dn21:2.1.6">“Lord of gods, the fetters of jealousy and stinginess bind the gods, humans, demons, dragons, fairies—and any of the other diverse creatures—so that, though they wish to be free of enmity, violence, hostility, and hate, they still have enmity, violence, hostility, and hate.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.1.8">Such was the Buddha’s answer to Sakka. Delighted, Sakka approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, saying, “That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! Hearing the Buddha’s answer, I’ve gone beyond doubt and got rid of indecision.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.2.1">And then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, Sakka asked another question: </p>
<p id="dn21:2.2.2">“But dear sir, what is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of jealousy and stinginess? When what exists is there jealousy and stinginess? When what doesn’t exist is there no jealousy and stinginess?” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.2.5">“The liked and the disliked, lord of gods, are the source of jealousy and stinginess. When the liked and the disliked exist there is jealousy and stinginess. When the liked and the disliked don’t exist there is no jealousy and stinginess.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.2.8">“But dear sir, what is the source of what is liked and disliked?” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.2.11">“Desire is the source of what is liked and disliked.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.2.14">“But what is the source of desire?” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.2.17">“Thought is the source of desire.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.2.20">“But what is the source of thought?” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.2.23">“Concepts of identity that emerge from the proliferation of perceptions are the source of thoughts.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.3.1">“But how does a mendicant fittingly practice for the cessation of concepts of identity that emerge from the proliferation of perceptions?” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.2. Meditation on Feelings </h4>
<p id="dn21:2.3.3">“Lord of gods, there are two kinds of happiness, I say: that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate. There are two kinds of sadness, I say: that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate. There are two kinds of equanimity, I say: that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate. </p>
<p id="dn21:2.3.9">Why did I say that there are two kinds of happiness? Well, should you know of a happiness: ‘When I cultivate this kind of happiness, unskillful qualities grow, and skillful qualities decline.’ You should not cultivate that kind of happiness. Whereas, should you know of a happiness: ‘When I cultivate this kind of happiness, unskillful qualities decline, and skillful qualities grow.’ You should cultivate that kind of happiness. And that which is free of placing the mind and keeping it connected is better than that which still involves placing the mind and keeping it connected. That’s why I said there are two kinds of happiness. </p>
<p id="dn21:2.3.17">Why did I say that there are two kinds of sadness? Well, should you know of a sadness: ‘When I cultivate this kind of sadness, unskillful qualities grow, and skillful qualities decline.’ You should not cultivate that kind of sadness. Whereas, should you know of a sadness: ‘When I cultivate this kind of sadness, unskillful qualities decline, and skillful qualities grow.’ You should cultivate that kind of sadness. And that which is free of placing the mind and keeping it connected is better than that which still involves placing the mind and keeping it connected. That’s why I said there are two kinds of sadness. </p>
<p id="dn21:2.3.25">Why did I say that there are two kinds of equanimity? Well, should you know of an equanimity: ‘When I cultivate this kind of equanimity, unskillful qualities grow, and skillful qualities decline.’ You should not cultivate that kind of equanimity. Whereas, should you know of an equanimity: ‘When I cultivate this kind of equanimity, unskillful qualities decline, and skillful qualities grow.’ You should cultivate that kind of equanimity. And that which is free of placing the mind and keeping it connected is better than that which still involves placing the mind and keeping it connected. That’s why I said there are two kinds of equanimity. </p>
<p id="dn21:2.3.33">That’s how a mendicant fittlingly practices for the cessation of concepts of identity that emerge from the proliferation of perceptions.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.3.34">Such was the Buddha’s answer to Sakka. Delighted, Sakka approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, saying, “That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! Hearing the Buddha’s answer, I’ve gone beyond doubt and got rid of indecision.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.3. Restraint in the Monastic Code </h4>
<p id="dn21:2.4.1">And then Sakka asked another question: </p>
<p id="dn21:2.4.2">“But dear sir, how does a mendicant practice for restraint in the monastic code?” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.4.3">“Lord of gods, I say that there are two kinds of bodily behavior: that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate. I say that there are two kinds of verbal behavior: that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate. There are two kinds of search, I say: that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate. </p>
<p id="dn21:2.4.9">Why did I say that there are two kinds of bodily behavior? Well, should you know of a bodily conduct: ‘When I cultivate this kind of bodily conduct, unskillful qualities grow, and skillful qualities decline.’ You should not cultivate that kind of bodily conduct. Whereas, should you know of a bodily conduct: ‘When I cultivate this kind of bodily conduct, unskillful qualities decline, and skillful qualities grow.’ You should cultivate that kind of bodily conduct. That’s why I said there are two kinds of bodily behavior. </p>
<p id="dn21:2.4.17">Why did I say that there are two kinds of verbal behavior? Well, should you know of a kind of verbal behavior that it causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline, you should not cultivate it. Whereas, should you know of a kind of verbal behavior that it causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow, you should cultivate it. That’s why I said there are two kinds of verbal behavior. </p>
<p id="dn21:2.4.24">Why did I say that there are two kinds of search? Well, should you know of a kind of search that it causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline, you should not cultivate it. Whereas, should you know of a kind of search that it causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow, you should cultivate it. That’s why I said there are two kinds of search. </p>
<p id="dn21:2.4.31">That’s how a mendicant practices for restraint in the monastic code.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.4.32">Such was the Buddha’s answer to Sakka. Delighted, Sakka approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, saying, “That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! Hearing the Buddha’s answer, I’ve gone beyond doubt and got rid of indecision.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.4. Sense Restraint </h4>
<p id="dn21:2.5.1">And then Sakka asked another question: </p>
<p id="dn21:2.5.2">“But dear sir, how does a mendicant practice for restraint of the sense faculties?” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.5.3">“Lord of gods, I say that there are two kinds of sight known by the eye: that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate. There are two kinds of sound known by the ear … smells known by the nose … tastes known by the tongue … touches known by the body … thoughts known by the mind: that which you should cultivate, and that which you should not cultivate.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.5.15">When the Buddha said this, Sakka said to him: </p>
<p id="dn21:2.5.16">“Sir, this is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement: You should not cultivate the kind of sight known by the eye which causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline. And you should cultivate the kind of sight known by the eye which causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow. You should not cultivate the kind of sound, smell, taste, touch, or thought known by the mind which causes unskillful qualities to grow while skillful qualities decline. And you should cultivate the kind of thought known by the mind which causes unskillful qualities to decline while skillful qualities grow. </p>
<p id="dn21:2.5.25">Sir, that’s how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement. Hearing the Buddha’s answer, I’ve gone beyond doubt and got rid of indecision.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.6.1">And then Sakka asked another question: </p>
<p id="dn21:2.6.2">“Dear sir, do all ascetics and brahmins have the same doctrine, ethics, desires, and attachments?” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.6.3">“No, lord of gods, they do not.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.6.4">“Why not?” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.6.5">“The world has many and diverse elements. Whatever element sentient beings insist on in this world of many and diverse elements, they obstinately stick to it, insisting that: ‘This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.’ That’s why not all ascetics and brahmins have the same doctrine, ethics, desires, and attachments.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.6.9">“Dear sir, have all ascetics and brahmins reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal?” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.6.10">“No, lord of gods, they have not.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.6.11">“Why not?” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.6.12">“Those mendicants who are freed through the ending of craving have reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. That’s why not all ascetics and brahmins have reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.6.14">Such was the Buddha’s answer to Sakka. Delighted, Sakka approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, saying, “That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! Hearing the Buddha’s answer, I’ve gone beyond doubt and got rid of indecision.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.6.18">And then Sakka asked another question: </p>
<p id="dn21:2.7.1">“Turbulence, sir, is a disease, a boil, a dart. Turbulence drags a person to be reborn in life after life. That’s why a person finds themselves in states high and low. Elsewhere, among other ascetics and brahmins, I wasn’t even given a chance to ask these questions that the Buddha has answered. The dart of doubt and uncertainty has lain within me for a long time, but the Buddha has plucked it out.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.7.5">“Lord of gods, do you recall having asked this question of other ascetics and brahmins?” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.7.6">“I do, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.7.7">“If you wouldn’t mind, lord of gods, tell me how they answered.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.7.8">“It’s no trouble when someone such as the Blessed One is sitting here.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.7.9">“Well, speak then, lord of gods.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.7.10">“Sir, I approached those who I imagined were ascetics and brahmins living in the wilderness, in remote lodgings. But they were stumped by my question, and they even questioned me in return: ‘What is the venerable’s name?’ So I answered them: ‘Dear sir, I am Sakka, lord of gods.’ So they asked me another question: ‘But lord of gods, what deed brought you to this position?’ So I taught them the Dhamma as I had learned and memorized it. And they were pleased with just that much: ‘We have seen Sakka, lord of gods! And he answered our questions!’ Invariably, they become my disciples, I don’t become theirs. But sir, I am the Buddha’s disciple, a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.5. On Feeling Happy </h4>
<p id="dn21:2.7.22">“Lord of gods, do you recall ever feeling such joy and happiness before?” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.7.23">“I do, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.7.24">“But how?” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.7.25">“Once upon a time, sir, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons. In that battle the gods won and the demons lost. It occurred to me as victor, ‘Now the gods shall enjoy both the nectar of the gods and the nectar of the demons.’ But sir, that joy and happiness is in the sphere of the rod and the sword. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. But the joy and happiness I feel listening to the Buddha’s teaching is not in the sphere of the rod and the sword. It does lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.8.1">“But lord of gods, what reason do you see for speaking of such joy and happiness?” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.8.2">“I see six reasons to speak of such joy and happiness, sir. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn21:2.8.3">While staying right here, <br/>remaining in the godly form, <br/>I have gained an extended life: <br/>know this, dear sir. </p>

<p id="dn21:2.8.7">This is the first reason. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn21:2.8.8">When I fall from the heavenly host, <br/>leaving behind the non-human life, <br/>I shall consciously go to a new womb, <br/>wherever my mind delights. </p>

<p id="dn21:2.8.12">This is the second reason. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn21:2.8.13">Living happily under the guidance <br/>of the one of unclouded wisdom, <br/>I shall practice according to method, <br/>aware and mindful. </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn21:2.8.17">This is the third reason. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn21:2.8.18">And if awakening should arise <br/>as I practice according to the method, <br/>I shall live as one who understands, <br/>and my end shall come right there. </p>

<p id="dn21:2.8.22">This is the fourth reason. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn21:2.8.23">When I fall from the human realm, <br/>leaving behind the human life, <br/>I shall become a god again, <br/>in the supreme heaven realm. </p>

<p id="dn21:2.8.27">This is the fifth reason. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn21:2.8.28">They are the finest of gods, <br/>the glorious Akaniṭṭhas. <br/>So long as my final life goes on, <br/>there my home will be. </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn21:2.8.32">This is the sixth reason. </p>
<p id="dn21:2.8.33">Seeing these six reasons I speak of such joy and happiness. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn21:2.9.1">My wishes unfulfilled, <br/>doubting and undecided, <br/>I wandered for such a long time, <br/>in search of the Realized One. </p>
<p id="dn21:2.9.5">I imagined that ascetics <br/>living in seclusion <br/>must surely be awakened, <br/>so I went to sit near them. </p>
<p id="dn21:2.9.9">‘How is there success? <br/>How is there failure?’ <br/>But they were stumped by such questions <br/>about the path and practice. </p>
<p id="dn21:2.9.13">And when they found out that I <br/>was Sakka, come from the gods, <br/>they questioned me instead about <br/>the deed that brought me to this state. </p>
<p id="dn21:2.9.17">I taught them the Dhamma <br/>as I had learned it among men. <br/>They were delighted with that, saying: <br/>‘We’ve seen Vāsava!’ </p>
<p id="dn21:2.9.21">Now since I’ve seen the Buddha, <br/>who helps us overcome doubt, <br/>today, free of fear, <br/>I pay homage to the awakened one. </p>
<p id="dn21:2.9.25">Destroyer of the dart of craving, <br/>the Buddha is unrivaled. <br/>I bow to the great hero, <br/>the Buddha, kinsman of the Sun. </p>
<p id="dn21:2.9.29">Just as Brahmā is worshipped <br/>by the gods, dear sir, <br/>today we shall worship you—<br/>come, let us bow to you! </p>

</blockquote>
<p id="dn21:2.10.1">Then Sakka addressed the fairy Pañcasikha, “Dear Pañcasikha, you were very helpful to me, since you first charmed the Buddha, after which I went to see him. I shall appoint you to your father’s position—you shall be king of the fairies. And I give you Bhaddā Suriyavaccasā, who you love so much.” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.10.5">Then Sakka, touching the ground with his hand, expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times: </p>
<p id="dn21:2.10.6">“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! </p>
<p id="dn21:2.10.7">Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! </p>
<p id="dn21:2.10.8">Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!” </p>
<p id="dn21:2.10.9">And while this discourse was being spoken, the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in Sakka, lord of gods: “Everything that has a beginning has an end.” And also for another 80,000 deities. </p>
<p id="dn21:2.10.12">Such were the questions Sakka was invited to ask, and which were answered by the Buddha. And that’s why the name of this discussion is “Sakka’s Questions”. </p>

<p id="dn22:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>
<p id="dn22:1.5">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="dn22:1.7">“Mendicants, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment. </p>
<p id="dn22:1.8">What four? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">1. Observing the Body </h3>
<h4 class="subheading">1.1. Mindfulness of Breathing </h4>
<p id="dn22:2.1">And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the body? </p>
<p id="dn22:2.2">It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and focuses their mindfulness right there. Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. </p>
<p id="dn22:2.4">When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ </p>
<p id="dn22:2.5">When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ When breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’ </p>
<p id="dn22:2.6">They practice breathing in experiencing the whole body. They practice breathing out experiencing the whole body. </p>
<p id="dn22:2.7">They practice breathing in stilling the body’s motion. They practice breathing out stilling the body’s motion. </p>
<p id="dn22:2.8">It’s like a deft carpenter or carpenter’s apprentice. When making a deep cut they know: ‘I’m making a deep cut,’ and when making a shallow cut they know: ‘I’m making a shallow cut.’ </p>
<p id="dn22:2.11">And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world. </p>
<p id="dn22:2.14">That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.2. The Postures </h4>
<p id="dn22:3.1">Furthermore, when a mendicant is walking they know: ‘I am walking.’ When standing they know: ‘I am standing.’ When sitting they know: ‘I am sitting.’ And when lying down they know: ‘I am lying down.’ Whatever posture their body is in, they know it. </p>
<p id="dn22:3.3">And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world. </p>
<p id="dn22:3.6">That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.3. Situational Awareness </h4>
<p id="dn22:4.1">Furthermore, a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl, and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent. </p>
<p id="dn22:4.2">And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally … </p>
<p id="dn22:4.3">That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.4. Focusing on the Repulsive </h4>
<p id="dn22:5.1">Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth. ‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’ </p>
<p id="dn22:5.3">It’s as if there were a bag with openings at both ends, filled with various kinds of grains, such as fine rice, wheat, mung beans, peas, sesame, and ordinary rice. And someone with good eyesight were to open it and examine the contents: ‘These grains are fine rice, these are wheat, these are mung beans, these are peas, these are sesame, and these are ordinary rice.’ </p>
<p id="dn22:5.6">And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally … </p>
<p id="dn22:5.7">That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.5. Focusing on the Elements </h4>
<p id="dn22:6.1">Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, whatever its placement or posture, according to the elements: ‘In this body there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.’ </p>
<p id="dn22:6.3">It’s as if a deft butcher or butcher’s apprentice were to kill a cow and sit down at the crossroads with the meat cut into portions. </p>
<p id="dn22:6.6">And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally … </p>
<p id="dn22:6.7">That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.6. The Charnel Ground Contemplations </h4>
<p id="dn22:7.1">Furthermore, suppose a mendicant were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground. And it had been dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering. They’d compare it with their own body: ‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’ And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally … </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="dn22:7.5">That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body. </p>
<p id="dn22:8.1">Furthermore, suppose they were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, herons, dogs, tigers, leopards, jackals, and many kinds of little creatures. They’d compare it with their own body: ‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’ And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally … </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="dn22:8.5">That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="dn22:9.1">Furthermore, suppose they were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together by sinews … </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="dn22:9.2">A skeleton without flesh but smeared with blood, and held together by sinews … </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="dn22:9.3">A skeleton rid of flesh and blood, held together by sinews … </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="dn22:9.4">Bones rid of sinews, scattered in every direction. Here a hand-bone, there a foot-bone, here a shin-bone, there a thigh-bone, here a hip-bone, there a rib-bone, here a back-bone, there an arm-bone, here a neck-bone, there a jaw-bone, here a tooth, there the skull … </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="dn22:10.1">White bones, the color of shells … </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="dn22:10.2">Decrepit bones, heaped in a pile … </p>
<p id="dn22:10.3">Bones rotted and crumbled to powder. They’d compare it with their own body: ‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’ And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally.

<p id="dn22:17.1">Furthermore, a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the four noble truths. And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of principles with respect to the four noble truths? </p>
<p id="dn22:17.3">It’s when a mendicant truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’ </p>
<p class="endsection" id="dn22:17.4">The first recitation section is finished. </p>
<h5 class="subheading">4.5.1. The Truth of Suffering </h5>
<p id="dn22:18.1">And what is the noble truth of suffering? </p>
<p id="dn22:18.2">Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; association with the disliked is suffering; separation from the liked is suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="dn22:18.3">And what is rebirth? The rebirth, inception, conception, reincarnation, manifestation of the sets of phenomena, and acquisition of the sense fields of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings. This is called rebirth. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="dn22:18.6">And what is old age? The old age, decrepitude, broken teeth, grey hair, wrinkly skin, diminished vitality, and failing faculties of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings. This is called old age. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="dn22:18.9">And what is death? The passing away, perishing, disintegration, demise, mortality, death, decease, breaking up of the aggregates, laying to rest of the corpse, and cutting off of the life faculty of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings. This is called death. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="dn22:18.12">And what is sorrow? The sorrow, sorrowing, state of sorrow, inner sorrow, inner deep sorrow in someone who has undergone misfortune, who has experienced suffering. This is called sorrow. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="dn22:18.15">And what is lamentation? The wail, lament, wailing, lamenting, state of wailing and lamentation in someone who has undergone misfortune, who has experienced suffering. This is called lamentation. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="dn22:18.18">And what is pain? Physical pain, physical displeasure, the painful, unpleasant feeling that’s born from physical contact. This is called pain. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="dn22:18.21">And what is sadness? Mental pain, mental displeasure, the painful, unpleasant feeling that’s born from mental contact. This is called sadness. </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="dn22:18.24">And what is distress? The stress, distress, state of stress and distress in someone who has undergone misfortune, who has experienced suffering. This is called distress. </p>
<p data-counter="9" id="dn22:18.27">And what is meant by ‘association with the disliked is suffering’? There are sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts that are unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable. And there are those who want to harm, injure, disturb, and threaten you. The coming together with these, the joining, inclusion, mixing with them: this is what is meant by ‘association with the disliked is suffering’. </p>
<p data-counter="10" id="dn22:18.30">And what is meant by ‘separation from the liked is suffering’? There are sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts that are likable, desirable, and agreeable. And there are those who want to benefit, help, comfort, and protect you. The division from these, the disconnection, segregation, and parting from them: this is what is meant by ‘separation from the liked is suffering’. </p>
<p data-counter="11" id="dn22:18.33">And what is meant by ‘not getting what you wish for is suffering’? In sentient beings who are liable to be reborn, such a wish arises: ‘Oh, if only we were not liable to be reborn! If only rebirth would not come to us!’ But you can’t get that by wishing. This is what is meant by ‘not getting what you wish for is suffering.’ In sentient beings who are liable to grow old … fall ill … die … experience sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress, such a wish arises: ‘Oh, if only we were not liable to experience sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress! If only sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress would not come to us!’ But you can’t get that by wishing. This is what is meant by ‘not getting what you wish for is suffering.’ </p>
<p id="dn22:18.48">And what is meant by ‘in brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering’? They are the grasping aggregates that consist of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. This is what is meant by ‘in brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering’. </p>
<p id="dn22:18.51">This is called the noble truth of suffering. </p>
<h5 class="subheading">4.5.2. The Origin of Suffering </h5>
<p id="dn22:19.1">And what is the noble truth of the origin of suffering? </p>
<p id="dn22:19.2">It’s the craving that leads to future lives, mixed up with relishing and greed, chasing pleasure in various realms. That is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for continued existence, and craving to end existence. </p>
<p id="dn22:19.4">But where does that craving arise and where does it settle? Whatever in the world seems nice and pleasant, it is there that craving arises and settles. </p>
<p id="dn22:19.6">And what in the world seems nice and pleasant? The eye in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles. The ear … nose … tongue … body … mind in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles. </p>
<p id="dn22:19.13">Sights … sounds … smells … tastes … touches … thoughts in the world seem nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles. </p>
<p id="dn22:19.19">Eye consciousness … ear consciousness … nose consciousness … tongue consciousness … body consciousness … mind consciousness in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles. </p>
<p id="dn22:19.25">Eye contact … ear contact … nose contact … tongue contact … body contact … mind contact in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles. </p>
<p id="dn22:19.31">Feeling born of eye contact … feeling born of ear contact … feeling born of nose contact … feeling born of tongue contact … feeling born of body contact … feeling born of mind contact in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles. </p>
<p id="dn22:19.37">Perception of sights … perception of sounds … perception of smells … perception of tastes … perception of touches … perception of thoughts in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles. </p>
<p id="dn22:19.43">Intention regarding sights … intention regarding sounds … intention regarding smells … intention regarding tastes … intention regarding touches … intention regarding thoughts in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles. </p>
<p id="dn22:19.49">Craving for sights … craving for sounds … craving for smells … craving for tastes … craving for touches … craving for thoughts in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles. </p>
<p id="dn22:19.55">Thoughts about sights … thoughts about sounds … thoughts about smells … thoughts about tastes … thoughts about touches … thoughts about thoughts in the world seem nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles. </p>
<p id="dn22:19.61">Considerations regarding sights … considerations regarding sounds … considerations regarding smells … considerations regarding tastes … considerations regarding touches … considerations regarding thoughts in the world seem nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles. </p>
<p id="dn22:19.67">This is called the noble truth of the origin of suffering. </p>
<h5 class="subheading">4.5.3. The Cessation of Suffering </h5>
<p id="dn22:20.1">And what is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering? </p>
<p id="dn22:20.2">It’s the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over; giving it away, letting it go, releasing it, and not adhering to it. </p>
<p id="dn22:20.3">Whatever in the world seems nice and pleasant, it is there that craving is given up and ceases. </p>
<p id="dn22:20.5">And what in the world seems nice and pleasant? The eye in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving is given up and ceases. … </p>
<p id="dn22:20.60">Considerations regarding thoughts in the world seem nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving is given up and ceases. </p>
<p id="dn22:20.66">This is called the noble truth of the cessation of suffering. </p>
<h5 class="subheading">4.5.4. The Path </h5>
<p id="dn22:21.1">And what is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering? </p>
<p id="dn22:21.2">It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="dn22:21.4">And what is right view? Knowing about suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. This is called right view. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="dn22:21.7">And what is right thought? Thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness. This is called right thought. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="dn22:21.10">And what is right speech? The refraining from lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, and talking nonsense. This is called right speech. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="dn22:21.13">And what is right action? Refraining from killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct. This is called right action. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="dn22:21.16">And what is right livelihood? It’s when a noble disciple gives up wrong livelihood and earns a living by right livelihood. This is called right livelihood. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="dn22:21.19">And what is right effort? It’s when a mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are completed by development. This is called right effort. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="dn22:21.25">And what is right mindfulness? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. This is called right mindfulness. </p>
<p id="dn22:21.31">And what is right immersion? It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. This is called right immersion. </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="dn22:21.37">This is called the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. </p>
<p id="dn22:21.38">And so they meditate observing an aspect of principles internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing the principles as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that principles exist, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world. </p>
<p id="dn22:21.41">That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the four noble truths. </p>
<p id="dn22:22.1">Anyone who develops these four kinds of mindfulness meditation in this way for seven years can expect one of two results: enlightenment in the present life, or if there’s something left over, non-return. </p>
<p id="dn22:22.3">Let alone seven years, anyone who develops these four kinds of mindfulness meditation in this way for six years … five years … four years … three years … two years … one year … seven months … six months … five months … four months … three months … two months … one month … a fortnight … Let alone a fortnight, anyone who develops these four kinds of mindfulness meditation in this way for seven days can expect one of two results: enlightenment in the present life, or if there’s something left over, non-return. </p>
<p id="dn22:22.24">‘The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.” </p>
<p id="dn22:22.26">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. </p>

<h2 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">DN 23</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">With Pāyāsi </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Pāyāsisutta</span></h2>
<p id="dn23:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time Venerable Kassapa the Prince was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a Kosalan citadel named Setavyā. He stayed in the grove of Indian Rosewood to the north of Setavyā. </p>
<p id="dn23:1.4">Now at that time the chieftain Pāyāsi was living in Setavyā. It was a crown property given by King Pasenadi of Kosala, teeming with living creatures, full of hay, wood, water, and grain, a royal endowment of the highest quality. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">1. On Pāyāsi </h3>
<p id="dn23:2.1">Now at that time Pāyāsi had the following harmful misconception: “There’s no afterlife. No beings are reborn spontaneously. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds.” </p>
<p id="dn23:2.3">The brahmins and householders of Setavyā heard, “It seems the ascetic Kassapa the Prince—a disciple of the ascetic Gotama—is staying in the grove of Indian Rosewood to the north of Setavyā. He has this good reputation: ‘He is astute, competent, intelligent, learned, a brilliant speaker, eloquent, mature, a perfected one.’ It’s good to see such perfected ones.” Then, having departed Setavyā, they formed into companies and headed north to the grove. </p>
<p id="dn23:3.1">Now at that time the chieftain Pāyāsi had retired to the upper floor of his stilt longhouse for his midday nap. He saw the brahmins and householders heading north towards the grove, and addressed his steward, “My steward, why are the brahmins and householders heading north towards the grove?” </p>
<p id="dn23:3.5">“The ascetic Kassapa the Prince—a disciple of the ascetic Gotama—is staying in the grove of Indian Rosewood to the north of Setavyā. He has this good reputation: ‘He is astute, competent, intelligent, learned, a brilliant speaker, eloquent, mature, a perfected one.’ They’re going to see that Kassapa the Prince.” </p>
<p id="dn23:3.9">“Well then, go to the brahmins and householders and say to them: ‘Sirs, the chieftain Pāyāsi asks you to wait, as he will also go to see the ascetic Kassapa the Prince.’ Before Kassapa the Prince convinces those foolish and incompetent brahmins and householders that there is an afterlife, there are beings reborn spontaneously, and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deeds—for none of these things are true!” </p>
<p id="dn23:3.15">“Yes, sir,” replied the steward, and did as he was asked. </p>
<p id="dn23:4.1">Then Pāyāsi escorted by the brahmins and householders, went up to Kassapa the Prince, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Before sitting down to one side, some of the brahmins and householders of Setavyā bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward Kassapa the Prince, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. Nihilism </h3>
<p id="dn23:5.1">Seated to one side, the chieftain Pāyāsi said to Venerable Kassapa the Prince, “Master Kassapa, this is my doctrine and view: ‘There’s no afterlife. No beings are reborn spontaneously. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds.’” </p>
<p id="dn23:5.4">“Well, chieftain, I’ve never seen or heard of anyone holding such a doctrine or view. For how on earth can anyone say such a thing? </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.1. The Simile of the Moon and Sun </h4>
<p id="dn23:5.8">Well then, chieftain, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. What do you think, chieftain? Are the moon and sun in this world or the other world? Are they gods or humans?” </p>
<p id="dn23:5.11">“They are in the other world, Master Kassapa, and they are gods, not humans.” </p>
<p id="dn23:5.12">“By this method it ought to be proven that there is an afterlife, there are beings reborn spontaneously, and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deeds.” </p>
<p id="dn23:6.1">“Even though Master Kassapa says this, still I think that there’s no afterlife, no beings are reborn spontaneously, and there’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds.” </p>
<p id="dn23:6.3">“Is there a method by which you can prove what you say?” </p>
<p id="dn23:6.5">“There is, Master Kassapa.” </p>
<p id="dn23:6.7">“How, exactly, chieftain?” </p>
<p id="dn23:6.8">“Well, I have friends and colleagues, relatives and kin who kill living creatures, steal, and commit sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, with wrong view. Some time later they become sick, suffering, gravely ill. When I know that they will not recover from their illness, I go to them and say, ‘Sirs, there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: “Those who kill living creatures, steal, and commit sexual misconduct; use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and are covetous, malicious, and have wrong view—when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.” You do all these things. If what those ascetics and brahmins say is true, when your body breaks up, after death, you’ll be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. If that happens, sirs, come and tell me that there is an afterlife, there are beings reborn spontaneously, and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deeds. I trust you and believe you. Anything you see will be just as if I’ve seen it for myself.’ They agree to this. But they don’t come back to tell me, nor do they send a messenger. This is the method by which I prove that there’s no afterlife, no beings are reborn spontaneously, and there’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.2. The Simile of the Bandit </h4>
<p id="dn23:7.1">“Well then, chieftain, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. What do you think, chieftain? Suppose they were to arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to you, saying, ‘Sir, this is a bandit, a criminal. Punish him as you will.’ Then you’d say to them, ‘Well then, my men, tie this man’s arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope. Shave his head and march him from street to street and square to square to the beating of a harsh drum. Then take him out the south gate and there, at the place of execution to the south of the city, chop off his head.’ Saying, ‘Good,’ they’d do as they were told, sitting him down at the place of execution. Could that bandit get the executioners to wait, saying, ‘Please, good executioners! I have friends and colleagues, relatives and kin in such and such village or town. Wait until I’ve visited them, then I’ll come back’? Or would they just chop off his head as he prattled on?” </p>
<p id="dn23:7.13">“They’d just chop off his head.” </p>
<p id="dn23:7.14">“So even a human bandit couldn’t get his human executioners to stay his execution. What then of your friends and colleagues, relatives and kin who are reborn in a lower realm after doing bad things? Could they get the wardens of hell to wait, saying, ‘Please, good wardens of hell! Wait until I’ve gone to the chieftain Pāyāsi to tell him that there is an afterlife, there are beings reborn spontaneously, and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deeds’? By this method, too, it ought to be proven that there is an afterlife, there are beings reborn spontaneously, and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deeds.” </p>
<p id="dn23:8.1">“Even though Master Kassapa says this, still I think that there’s no afterlife.” </p>
<p id="dn23:8.3">“Is there a method by which you can prove what you say?” </p>
<p id="dn23:8.5">“There is, Master Kassapa.” </p>
<p id="dn23:8.7">“How, exactly, chieftain?” </p>
<p id="dn23:8.8">“Well, I have friends and colleagues, relatives and kin who refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, and committing sexual misconduct. They refrain from speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re content, kind-hearted, with right view. Some time later they become sick, suffering, gravely ill. When I know that they will not recover from their illness, I go to them and say, ‘Sirs, there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: “Those who refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, and committing sexual misconduct; who refrain from speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; and are content, kind-hearted, with right view—when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.” You do all these things. If what those ascetics and brahmins say is true, when your body breaks up, after death, you’ll be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. If that happens, sirs, come and tell me that there is an afterlife. I trust you and believe you. Anything you see will be just as if I’ve seen it for myself.’ They agree to this. But they don’t come back to tell me, nor do they send a messenger. This is the method by which I prove that there’s no afterlife.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.3. The Simile of the Sewer </h4>
<p id="dn23:9.1">“Well then, chieftain, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said. Suppose there were a man sunk over his head in a sewer. Then you were to order someone to pull him out of the sewer, and they’d agree to do so. Then you’d tell them to carefully scrape the dung off that man’s body with bamboo scrapers, and they’d agree to do so. Then you’d tell them to carefully scrub that man’s body down with pale clay three times, and they’d do so. Then you’d tell them to smear that man’s body with oil, and carefully wash him down with fine paste three times, and they’d do so. Then you’d tell them to dress that man’s hair and beard, and they’d do so. Then you’d tell them to provide that man with costly garlands, makeup, and clothes, and they’d do so. Then you’d tell them to bring that man up to the stilt longhouse and set him up with the five kinds of sensual stimulation, and they’d do so. </p>
<p id="dn23:9.25">What do you think, chieftain? Now that man is nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed, bedecked with garlands and bracelets, dressed in white, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation upstairs in the royal longhouse. Would he want to dive back into that sewer again?” </p>
<p id="dn23:9.27">“No, Master Kassapa. Why is that? Because that sewer is filthy, stinking, disgusting, and repulsive, and it’s regarded as such.” </p>
<p id="dn23:9.30">“In the same way, chieftain, to the gods, human beings are filthy, stinking, disgusting, and repulsive, and are regarded as such. The smell of humans reaches the gods even a hundred leagues away. What then of your friends and colleagues, relatives and kin who are reborn in a higher realm after doing good things? Will they come back to tell you that there is an afterlife? By this method, too, it ought to be proven that there is an afterlife.” </p>
<p id="dn23:10.1">“Even though Master Kassapa says this, still I think that there’s no afterlife.” </p>
<p id="dn23:10.3">“Can you prove it?” </p>
<p id="dn23:10.4">“I can.” </p>
<p id="dn23:10.5">“How, exactly, chieftain?” </p>
<p id="dn23:10.6">“Well, I have friends and colleagues, relatives and kin who refrain from killing living creatures and so on. Some time later they become sick, suffering, gravely ill. When I know that they will not recover from their illness, I go to them and say, ‘Sirs, there are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: “Those who refrain from killing living creatures and so on are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three.” You do all these things. If what those ascetics and brahmins say is true, when your body breaks up, after death, you’ll be reborn in the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three. If that happens, sirs, come and tell me that there is an afterlife. I trust you and believe you. Anything you see will be just as if I’ve seen it for myself.’ They agree to this. But they don’t come back to tell me, nor do they send a messenger. This is how I prove that there’s no afterlife.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.4. The Simile of the Gods of the Thirty-Three </h4>
<p id="dn23:11.1">“Well then, chieftain, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. A hundred human years are equivalent to one day and night for the gods of the Thirty-Three. Thirty such days make a month, and twelve months make a year. The gods of the Thirty-Three have a lifespan of a thousand such years. Now, as to your friends who are reborn in the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three after doing good things. If they think, ‘First I’ll amuse myself for two or three days, supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation. Then I’ll go back to Pāyāsi and tell him that there is an afterlife.’ Would they come back to tell you that there is an afterlife?” </p>
<p id="dn23:11.9">“No, Master Kassapa. For I would be long dead by then. But Master Kassapa, who has told you that the gods of the Thirty-Three exist, or that they have such a long life span? I don’t believe you.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.5. Blind From Birth </h4>
<p id="dn23:11.16">“Chieftain, suppose there was a person blind from birth. They couldn’t see sights that are dark or bright, or blue, yellow, red, or magenta. They couldn’t see even and uneven ground, or the stars, or the moon and sun. They’d say, ‘There’s no such thing as dark and bright sights, and no-one who sees them. There’s no such thing as blue, yellow, red, magenta, even and uneven ground, stars, moon and sun, and no-one who sees these things. I don’t know it or see it, therefore it doesn’t exist.’ Would they be speaking rightly?” </p>
<p id="dn23:11.28">“No, Master Kassapa. There are such things as dark and bright sights, and one who sees them. And those other things are real, too, as is the one who sees them. So it’s not right to say this: ‘I don’t know it or see it, therefore it doesn’t exist.’” </p>
<p id="dn23:11.36">“In the same way, chieftain, when you tell me you don’t believe me you seem like the blind man in the simile. You can’t see the other world the way you think, with the eye of the flesh. There are ascetics and brahmins who live in the wilderness, frequenting remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. Meditating diligent, keen, and resolute, they purify the divine eye, the power of clairvoyance. With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see this world and the other world, and sentient beings who are spontaneously reborn. That’s how to see the other world, not how you think, with the eye of the flesh. By this method, too, it ought to be proven that there is an afterlife.” </p>
<p id="dn23:12.1">“Even though Master Kassapa says this, still I think that there’s no afterlife.” </p>
<p id="dn23:12.3">“Can you prove it?” </p>
<p id="dn23:12.4">“I can.” </p>
<p id="dn23:12.5">“How, exactly, chieftain?” </p>
<p id="dn23:12.6">“Well, I see ascetics and brahmins who are ethical, of good character, who want to live and don’t want to die, who want to be happy and recoil from pain. I think to myself, ‘If those ascetics and brahmins knew that things were going to be better for them after death, they’d drink poison, slit their wrists, hang themselves, or throw themselves off a cliff. They mustn’t know that things are going to be better for them after death. That’s why they are ethical, of good character, wanting to live and not wanting to die, wanting to be happy and recoiling from pain.’ This is the method by which I prove that there’s no afterlife.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.6. The Simile of the Pregnant Woman </h4>
<p id="dn23:13.1">“Well then, chieftain, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said. </p>
<p id="dn23:13.3">Once upon a time, a certain brahmin had two wives. One had a son ten or twelve years of age, while the other was pregnant and about to give birth. Then the brahmin passed away. </p>
<p id="dn23:13.6">So the youth said to his mother’s co-wife, ‘Madam, all the wealth, grain, silver, and gold is mine, and you get nothing. Transfer to me my father’s inheritance.’ </p>
<p id="dn23:13.10">But the brahmin lady said, ‘Wait, my dear, until I give birth. If it’s a boy, one portion shall be his. If it’s a girl, she will be your reward.’ </p>
<p id="dn23:13.14">But for a second time, and a third time, the youth insisted that the entire inheritance must be his. </p>
<p id="dn23:13.26">So the brahmin lady took a knife, went to her bedroom, and sliced open her belly, thinking, ‘Until I give birth—whether it’s a boy or a girl!’ She destroyed her own life and that of the fetus, as well as any wealth. </p>
<p id="dn23:13.29">Being foolish and incompetent, she sought an inheritance irrationally and fell to ruin and disaster. In the same way, chieftain, being foolish and incompetent, you’re seeking the other world irrationally and will fall to ruin and disaster, just like that brahmin lady. Good ascetics and brahmins don’t force what is unripe to ripen; rather, they wait for it to ripen. For the life of clever ascetics and brahmins is beneficial. So long as they remain, good ascetics and brahmins make much merit, and act for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans. By this method, too, it ought to be proven that there is an afterlife.” </p>
<p id="dn23:14.1">“Even though Master Kassapa says this, still I think that there’s no afterlife.” </p>
<p id="dn23:14.3">“Can you prove it?” </p>
<p id="dn23:14.4">“I can.” </p>
<p id="dn23:14.5">“How, exactly, chieftain?” </p>
<p id="dn23:14.6">“Suppose they were to arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to me, saying, ‘Sir, this is a bandit, a criminal. Punish him as you will.’ I say to them, ‘Well then, sirs, place this man in a pot while he’s still alive. Close up the mouth, bind it up with damp leather, and seal it with a thick coat of damp clay. Then lift it up on a stove and light the fire.’ They agree, and do what I ask. When we know that that man has passed away, we lift down the pot and break it open, uncover the mouth, and slowly peek inside, thinking, ‘Hopefully we’ll see his soul escaping.’ But we don’t see his soul escaping. This is how I prove that there’s no afterlife.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.7. The Simile of the Dream </h4>
<p id="dn23:15.1">“Well then, chieftain, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. Do you recall ever having a midday nap and seeing delightful parks, woods, meadows, and lotus ponds in a dream?” </p>
<p id="dn23:15.3">“I do, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn23:15.4">“At that time were you guarded by hunchbacks, dwarves, midgets, and younglings?” </p>
<p id="dn23:15.5">“I was.” </p>
<p id="dn23:15.6">“But did they see your soul entering or leaving?” </p>
<p id="dn23:15.7">“No they did not.” </p>
<p id="dn23:15.8">“So if they couldn’t even see your soul entering or leaving while you were still alive, how could you see the soul of a dead man? By this method, too, it ought to be proven that there is an afterlife, there are beings reborn spontaneously, and there is a fruit or result of good and bad deeds.” </p>
<p id="dn23:16.1">“Even though Master Kassapa says this, still I think that there’s no afterlife.” </p>
<p id="dn23:16.3">“Can you prove it?” </p>

<p id="dn23:16.6">“Suppose they were to arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to me, saying, ‘Sir, this is a bandit, a criminal. Punish him as you will.’ I say to them, ‘Well then, sirs, weigh this man with scales while he’s still alive. Then strangle him with a bowstring, and when he’s dead, weigh him again.’ They agree, and do what I ask. So long as they are alive, they’re lighter, softer, more flexible. But when they die they become heavier, stiffer, less flexible. This is how I prove that there’s no afterlife.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.8. The Simile of the Hot Iron Ball </h4>
<p id="dn23:17.1">“Well then, chieftain, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said. Suppose a person was to heat an iron ball all day until it was burning, blazing, and glowing, and then they weigh it with scales. After some time, when it had cooled and become extinguished, they’d weigh it again. When would that iron ball be lighter, softer, and more workable—when it’s burning or when it’s cool?” </p>
<p id="dn23:17.6">“So long as the iron ball is full of heat and air—burning, blazing, and glowing—it’s lighter, softer, and more workable. But when it lacks heat and air—cooled and extinguished—it’s heavier, stiffer, and less workable.” </p>
<p id="dn23:17.8">“In the same way, so long as this body is full of life and warmth and consciousness it’s lighter, softer, and more flexible. But when it lacks life and warmth and consciousness it’s heavier, stiffer, and less flexible. By this method, too, it ought to be proven that there is an afterlife.” </p>

Punish him as you will.’ I say to them, ‘Well then, sirs, take this man’s life without injuring his outer skin, inner skin, flesh, sinews, bones, or marrow. Hopefully we’ll see his soul escaping.’ They agree, and do what I ask. When he’s half-dead, I tell them to lay him on his back in hope of seeing his soul escape. They do so. But we don’t see his soul escaping. I tell them to lay him bent over, to lay him on his side, to lay him on the other side; to stand him upright, to stand him upside down; to strike him with fists, stones, rods, and swords; and to give him a good shaking in hope of seeing his soul escape. They do all these things. But we don’t see his soul escaping. For him the eye itself is present, and so are those sights. Yet he does not experience that sense-field. The ear itself is present, and so are those sounds. Yet he does not experience that sense-field. The nose itself is present, and so are those smells. Yet he does not experience that sense-field. The tongue itself is present, and so are those tastes. Yet he does not experience that sense-field. The body itself is present, and so are those touches. Yet he does not experience that sense-field. This is how I prove that there’s no afterlife.” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.9. The Simile of the Horn Blower </h4>
<p id="dn23:19.1">“Well then, chieftain, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said. </p>
<p id="dn23:19.3">Once upon a time, a certain horn blower took his horn and traveled to a borderland, where he went to a certain village. Standing in the middle of the village, he sounded his horn three times, then placed it on the ground and sat down to one side. </p>
<p id="dn23:19.5">Then the people of the borderland thought, ‘What is making this sound, so arousing, sensuous, intoxicating, infatuating, and captivating?’ They gathered around the horn blower and said, ‘Mister, what is making this sound, so arousing, sensuous, intoxicating, infatuating, and captivating?’ </p>
<p id="dn23:19.9">‘The sound is made by this, which is called a horn.’ </p>
<p id="dn23:19.10">They laid that horn on its back, saying, ‘Speak, good horn! Speak, good horn!’ But still the horn made no sound. </p>
<p id="dn23:19.13">Then they lay the horn bent over, they lay it on its side, they lay it on its other side; they stood it upright, they stood it upside down; they struck it with fists, stones, rods, and swords; and they gave it a good shake, saying, ‘Speak, good horn! Speak, good horn!’ But still the horn made no sound. </p>
<p id="dn23:19.16">So the horn blower thought, ‘How foolish are these borderland folk! For how can they seek the sound of a horn so irrationally?’ And as they looked on, he picked up the horn, sounded it three times, and took it away with him. </p>
<p id="dn23:19.19">Then the people of the borderland thought, ‘So, it seems, when what is called a horn is accompanied by a person, effort, and wind, it makes a sound. But when these things are absent it makes no sound.’ </p>
<p id="dn23:19.21">In the same way, so long as this body is full of life and warmth and consciousness it walks back and forth, stands, sits, and lies down. It sees sights with the eye, hears sounds with the ear, smells odors with the nose, tastes flavors with the tongue, feels touches with the body, and knows thoughts with the mind. But when it lacks life and warmth and consciousness it does none of these things. By this method, too, it ought to be proven that there is an afterlife.” </p>

<h4 class="subheading">2.10. The Simile of the Fire-Worshiping Matted-Hair Ascetic </h4>
<p id="dn23:21.1">“Well then, chieftain, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said. </p>
<p id="dn23:21.3">Once upon a time, a certain fire-worshiping matted-hair ascetic settled in a leaf hut in a wilderness region. Then a caravan came out from a certain country. It stayed for one night not far from that ascetic’s hermitage, and then moved on. The ascetic thought, ‘Why don’t I go to that caravan’s campsite? Hopefully I’ll find something useful there.’ </p>
<p id="dn23:21.8">So he went, and he saw a little baby boy abandoned there. When he saw this he thought, ‘It’s not proper for me to look on while a human being dies. Why don’t I bring this boy back to my hermitage, nurse him, nourish him, and raise him?’ So that’s what he did. </p>
<p id="dn23:21.13">When the boy was ten or twelve years old, the ascetic had some business come up in the country. So he said to the boy, ‘My dear, I wish to go to the country. Serve the sacred flame. Do not extinguish it. But if you should extinguish it, here is the hatchet, the firewood, and the bundle of drill-sticks. Light the fire and serve it.’ And having instructed the boy, the ascetic went to the country. </p>
<p id="dn23:21.20">But the boy was so engrossed in his play, the fire went out. He thought, ‘My father told me to serve the sacred flame. Why don’t I light it again and serve it?’ </p>
<p id="dn23:21.27">So he chopped the bundle of drill-sticks with the hatchet, thinking, ‘Hopefully I’ll get a fire!’ But he still got no fire. </p>
<p id="dn23:21.30">He split the bundle of drill-sticks into two, three, four, five, ten, or a hundred parts. He chopped them into splinters, pounded them in a mortar, and swept them away in a strong wind, thinking, ‘Hopefully I’ll get a fire!’ But he still got no fire. </p>
<p id="dn23:21.33">Then the matted-hair ascetic, having concluded his business in the country, returned to his own hermitage, and said to the boy, ‘I trust, my dear, that the fire didn’t go out?’ And the boy told him what had happened. Then the ascetic thought, ‘How foolish is this boy, how incompetent! For how can he seek a fire so irrationally?’ </p>
<p id="dn23:21.49">So while the boy looked on, he took a bundle of fire-sticks, lit the fire, and said, ‘Dear boy, this is how to light a fire. Not the foolish and incompetent way you sought it so irrationally.’ In the same way, chieftain, being foolish and incompetent, you seek the other world irrationally. Let go of this harmful misconception, chieftain, let go of it! Don’t create lasting harm and suffering for yourself!” </p>
<p id="dn23:22.1">“Even though Master Kassapa says this, still I’m not able to let go of that harmful misconception. King Pasenadi of Kosala knows my views, and so do foreign kings. If I let go of this harmful misconception, people will say, ‘How foolish is the chieftain Pāyāsi, how incompetent, that he should hold on to a mistake!’ I shall carry on with this view out of anger, contempt, and spite!” </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.11. The Simile of the Two Caravan Leaders </h4>
<p id="dn23:23.1">“Well then, chieftain, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said. </p>
<p id="dn23:23.3">Once upon a time, a large caravan of a thousand wagons traveled from a country in the east to the west. Wherever they went they quickly used up the grass, wood, water, and the green foliage. Now, that caravan had two leaders, each in charge of five hundred wagons. They thought, ‘This is a large caravan of a thousand wagons. Wherever we go we quickly use up the grass, wood, water, and the green foliage. Why don’t we split the caravan in two halves?’ So that’s what they did. </p>
<p id="dn23:23.12">One caravan leader, having prepared much grass, wood, and water, started the caravan. After two or three days’ journey he saw a dark man with red eyes coming the other way in a donkey cart with muddy wheels. He was armored with a quiver and wreathed with yellow lotus, his clothes and hair all wet. Seeing him, he said, ‘Sir, where do you come from?’ </p>
<p id="dn23:23.15">‘From such and such a country.’ </p>
<p id="dn23:23.16">‘And where are you going?’ </p>
<p id="dn23:23.17">‘To the country named so and so.’ </p>
<p id="dn23:23.18">‘But has there been much rain in the desert up ahead?’ </p>
<p id="dn23:23.19">‘Indeed there has, sir. The paths are sprinkled with water, and there is much grass, wood, and water. Toss out your grass, wood, and water. Your wagons will move swiftly when lightly-laden, so don’t tire your draught teams.’ </p>
<p id="dn23:23.21">So the caravan leader addressed his drivers, ‘This man says that there has been much rain in the desert up ahead. He advises us to toss out the grass, wood, and water. The wagons will move swiftly when lightly-laden, and won’t tire our draught teams. So let’s toss out the grass, wood, and water and restart the caravan with lightly-laden wagons.’ </p>
<p id="dn23:23.26">‘Yes, sir,’ the drivers replied, and that’s what they did. </p>
<p id="dn23:23.27">But in the caravan’s first campsite they saw no grass, wood, or water. And in the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh campsites they saw no grass, wood, or water. And all fell to ruin and disaster. And the men and beasts in that caravan were all devoured by that non-human spirit. Only their bones remained. </p>
<p id="dn23:23.37">Now, when the second caravan leader knew that the first caravan was well underway, he prepared much grass, wood, and water and started the caravan. After two or three days’ journey he saw a dark man with red eyes coming the other way in a donkey cart with muddy wheels. He was armored with a quiver and wreathed with yellow lotus, his clothes and hair all wet. Seeing him, he said, ‘Sir, where do you come from?’ </p>
<p id="dn23:23.41">‘From such and such a country.’ </p>
<p id="dn23:23.42">‘And where are you going?’ </p>

The wagons will move swiftly when lightly-laden, and won’t tire our draught teams. But this person is neither our friend nor relative. How can we proceed out of trust in him? We shouldn’t toss out any grass, wood, or water, but continue with our goods laden as before. We shall not toss out any old stock.’ </p>
<p id="dn23:23.54">‘Yes, sir,’ the drivers replied, and they restarted the caravan with the goods laden as before. </p>
<p id="dn23:23.55">And in the caravan’s first campsite they saw no grass, wood, or water. And in the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh campsites they saw no grass, wood, or water. And they saw the other caravan that had come to ruin. And they saw the bones of the men and beasts who had been devoured by that non-human spirit. </p>
<p id="dn23:23.64">So the caravan leader addressed his drivers, ‘This caravan came to ruin, as happens when guided by a foolish caravan leader. Well then, sirs, toss out any of our merchandise that’s of little value, and take what’s valuable from this caravan.’ </p>
<p id="dn23:23.67">‘Yes, sir’ replied the drivers, and that’s what they did. They crossed over the desert safely, as happens when guided by an astute caravan leader. </p>
<p id="dn23:23.68">In the same way, chieftain, being foolish and incompetent, you will come to ruin seeking the other world irrationally, like the first caravan leader. And those who think you’re worth listening to and trusting will also come to ruin, like the drivers. Let go of this harmful misconception, chieftain, let go of it!

<p id="dn23:30.7">Master Kassapa, I wish to perform a great sacrifice. Please instruct me so it will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">4. On Sacrifice </h3>
<p id="dn23:31.1">“Chieftain, take the kind of sacrifice where cattle, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and various kinds of creatures are slaughtered. And the recipients have wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong immersion. That kind of sacrifice is not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or bountiful. </p>
<p id="dn23:31.2">Suppose a farmer was to enter a wood taking seed and plough. And on that barren field, that barren ground, with uncleared stumps he sowed seeds that were broken, spoiled, weather-damaged, infertile, and ill kept. And the heavens don’t provide enough rain when needed. Would those seeds grow, increase, and mature, and would the farmer get abundant fruit?” </p>
<p id="dn23:31.6">“No, Master Kassapa.” </p>
<p id="dn23:31.7">“In the same way, chieftain, take the kind of sacrifice where cattle, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and various kinds of creatures are slaughtered. And the recipients have wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong immersion. That kind of sacrifice is not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or bountiful. </p>
<p id="dn23:31.8">But take the kind of sacrifice where cattle, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and various kinds of creatures are not slaughtered. And the recipients have right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. That kind of sacrifice is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful. </p>
<p id="dn23:31.9">Suppose a farmer was to enter a wood taking seed and plough. And on that fertile field, that fertile ground, with well-cleared stumps he sowed seeds that were intact, unspoiled, not weather-damaged, fertile, and well kept. And the heavens provide plenty of rain when needed. Would those seeds grow, increase, and mature, and would the farmer get abundant fruit?” </p>
<p id="dn23:31.13">“Yes, Master Kassapa.” </p>
<p id="dn23:31.14">“In the same way, chieftain, take the kind of sacrifice where cattle, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and various kinds of creatures are not slaughtered. And the recipients have right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. That kind of sacrifice is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">5. On the Brahmin Student Uttara </h3>
<p id="dn23:32.1">Then the chieftain Pāyāsi set up an offering for ascetics and brahmins, for paupers, vagrants, nomads, and beggars. At that offering such food as rough gruel with pickles was given, and heavy clothes with knotted fringes. Now, it was a brahmin student named Uttara who organized that offering. </p>
<p id="dn23:32.4">When the offering was over he referred to it like this, “Through this offering may I be together with the chieftain Pāyāsi in this world, but not in the next.” </p>
<p id="dn23:32.6">Pāyāsi heard of this, so he summoned Uttara and said, “Is it really true, dear Uttara, that you referred to the offering in this way?” </p>
<p id="dn23:32.12">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn23:32.13">“But why? Don’t we who seek merit expect some result from the offering?” </p>
<p id="dn23:32.16">“At your offering such food as rough gruel with pickles was given, which you wouldn’t even want to touch with your foot, much less eat. And also heavy clothes with knotted fringes, which you also wouldn’t want to touch with your foot, much less wear. Sir, you’re dear and beloved to me. But how can I reconcile one so dear with something so disagreeable?” </p>
<p id="dn23:32.18">“Well then, dear Uttara, set up an offering with the same kind of food that I eat, and the same kind of clothes that I wear.” </p>
<p id="dn23:32.20">“Yes, sir,” replied Uttara, and did so. </p>
<p id="dn23:32.22">So the chieftain Pāyāsi gave gifts carelessly, thoughtlessly, not with his own hands, giving the dregs. When his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in company with the gods of the Four Great Kings, in an empty palace of acacia. But the brahmin student Uttara who organized the offering gave gifts carefully, thoughtfully, with his own hands, not giving the dregs. When his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in company with the gods of the Thirty-Three. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">6. The God Pāyāsi </h3>
<p id="dn23:33.1">Now at that time Venerable Gavampati would often go to that empty acacia palace for the day’s meditation. Then the god Pāyāsi went up to him, bowed, and stood to one side. Gavampati said to him, “Who are you, reverend?” </p>
<p id="dn23:33.4">“Sir, I am the chieftain Pāyāsi.” </p>
<p id="dn23:33.5">“Didn’t you have the view that there’s no afterlife, no beings are reborn spontaneously, and there’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds?” </p>
<p id="dn23:33.7">“It’s true, sir, I did have such a view. But Venerable Kassapa the Prince dissuaded me from that harmful misconception.” </p>
<p id="dn23:33.10">“But the student named Uttara who organized that offering for you—where has he been reborn?” </p>
<p id="dn23:33.11">“Sir, Uttara gave gifts carefully, thoughtfully, with his own hands, not giving the dregs. When his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in company with the gods of the Thirty-Three. But I gave gifts carelessly, thoughtlessly, not with my own hands, giving the dregs. When my body broke up, after death, I was reborn in company with the gods of the Four Great Kings, in an empty palace of acacia. </p>
<p id="dn23:33.13">So, sir, when you’ve returned to the human realm, please announce this: ‘Give gifts carefully, thoughtfully, with your own hands, not giving the dregs. The chieftain Pāyāsi gave gifts carelessly, thoughtlessly, not with his own hands, giving the dregs. When his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in company with the gods of the Four Great Kings, in an empty palace of acacia. But the brahmin student Uttara who organized the offering gave gifts carefully, thoughtfully, with his own hands, not giving the dregs. When his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in company with the gods of the Thirty-Three.’” </p>
<p id="dn23:34.1">So when Venerable Gavampati returned to the human realm he made that announcement. </p>

<h3 class="subheading">1. The Story of Sunakkhatta </h3>
<p id="dn24:1.1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Mallas, near the Mallian town named Anupiya. Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Anupiya for alms. Then it occurred to him, “It’s too early to wander for alms in Anupiya. Why don’t I go to the wanderer Bhaggavagotta’s monastery to visit him?” </p>
<p id="dn24:1.2.1">So that’s what he did. Then the wanderer Bhaggavagotta said to the Buddha, “Come, Blessed One! Welcome, Blessed One! It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here. Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.” </p>
<p id="dn24:1.2.7">The Buddha sat on the seat spread out, while Bhaggavagotta took a low seat, sat to one side, and said to the Buddha, “Sir, a few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me and said: ‘Now, Bhaggava, I have rejected the Buddha. Now I no longer live dedicated to him.’ Sir, is what Sunakkhatta said true?” </p>
<p id="dn24:1.2.14">“Indeed it is, Bhaggava. </p>
<p id="dn24:1.3.1">A few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi came to me, bowed, sat down to one side, and said: ‘Now I reject the Buddha! Now I shall no longer live dedicated to you.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.3.4">When Sunakkhatta said this, I said to him, ‘But Sunakkhatta, did I ever say to you: “Come, live dedicated to me”?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.3.7">‘No, sir.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.3.8">‘Or did you ever say to me: “Sir, I shall live dedicated to the Buddha”?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.3.10">‘No, sir.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.3.11">‘So it seems that I did not ask you to live dedicated to me, nor did you say you would live dedicated to me. In that case, you silly man, are you really in a position to be rejecting anything? See how far you have strayed!’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.4.1">‘But sir, the Buddha never performs any superhuman demonstrations of psychic power for me.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.4.2">‘But Sunakkhatta, did I ever say to you: “Come, live dedicated to me and I will perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power for you”?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.4.4">‘No, sir.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.4.5">‘Or did you ever say to me: “Sir, I shall live dedicated to the Buddha, and the Buddha will perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power for me”?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.4.7">‘No, sir.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.4.8">‘So it seems that I did not ask this of you, and you did not require it of me. In that case, you silly man, are you really in a position to be rejecting anything? What do you think, Sunakkhatta? Whether or not there is a demonstration of psychic power, does my teaching lead someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of suffering?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.4.15">‘It does, sir.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.4.16">‘So it seems that whether or not there is a demonstration of psychic power, my teaching leads someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of suffering. In that case, what is the point of superhuman demonstrations of psychic power? See how far you have strayed, you silly man!’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.5.1">‘But sir, the Buddha never describes the origin of the world to me.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.5.2">‘But Sunakkhatta, did I ever say to you: “Come, live dedicated to me and I will describe the origin of the world to you”?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.5.4">‘No, sir.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.5.5">‘Or did you ever say to me: “Sir, I shall live dedicated to the Buddha, and the Buddha will describe the origin of the world to me”?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.5.7">‘No, sir.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.5.8">‘So it seems that I did not ask this of you, and you did not require it of me. In that case, you silly man, are you really in a position to be rejecting anything? What do you think, Sunakkhatta? Whether or not the origin of the world is described, does my teaching lead someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of suffering?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.5.15">‘It does, sir.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.5.16">‘So it seems that whether or not the origin of the world is described, my teaching leads someone who practices it to the goal of the complete ending of suffering. In that case, what is the point of describing the origin of the world? See how far you have strayed, you silly man! </p>
<p id="dn24:1.6.1">In many ways, Sunakkhatta, you have praised me like this in the Vajjian capital: “That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.” </p>
<p id="dn24:1.6.4">In many ways you have praised the teaching like this in the Vajjian capital: “The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.” </p>
<p id="dn24:1.6.7">In many ways you have praised the Saṅgha like this in the Vajjian capital: “The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.” </p>
<p id="dn24:1.6.10">I declare this to you, Sunakkhatta, I announce this to you! There will be those who say that Sunakkhatta was unable to lead the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama. That’s why he resigned the training and returned to a lesser life. That’s what they’ll say.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.6.13">Though I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this, he still left this teaching and training, like someone on the highway to hell. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. On Korakkhattiya </h3>
<p id="dn24:1.7.1">Bhaggava, this one time I was staying in the land of the Thūlus where they have a town named Uttarakā. Then I robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, entered Uttarakā for alms with Sunakkhatta the Licchavi as my second monk. Now at that time the naked ascetic Korakkhattiya had taken a vow to behave like a dog. When food is tossed on the ground, he gets down on all fours, eating and devouring it just with his mouth. </p>
<p id="dn24:1.7.4">Sunakkhatta saw him doing this and thought, ‘That ascetic is a true holy man!’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.7.7">Then, knowing what Sunakkhatta was thinking, I said to him, ‘Don’t you claim to be an ascetic, a follower of the Sakyan, you silly man?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.7.9">‘But why does the Buddha say this to me?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.7.11">‘When you saw that naked ascetic Korakkhattiya, didn’t you think, “That ascetic is a true holy man!”?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.7.13">‘Yes, sir. But sir, are you jealous of the perfected ones?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.7.15">‘I’m not jealous of the perfected ones, you silly man. Rather, you should give up this harmful misconception that has arisen in you. Don’t create lasting harm and suffering for yourself! </p>
<p id="dn24:1.7.18">That naked ascetic Korakkhattiya, who you imagine to be a true holy man, will die of flatulence in seven days. And when he dies, he’ll be reborn in the very lowest rank of demons, named the Kālakañjas. And they’ll throw him in the charnel ground on a clump of vetiver. If you wish, Sunakkhatta, go to Korakkhattiya and ask him whether he knows his own destiny. It’s possible that he will answer: “Reverend Sunakkhatta, I know my own destiny. I’ve been reborn in the very lowest rank of demons, named the Kālakañjas.”’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.8.1">So, Bhaggava, Sunakkhatta went to see Korakkhattiya and said to him, ‘Reverend Korakkhattiya, the ascetic Gotama has declared that you will die of flatulence in seven days. And when you die, you’ll be reborn in the very lowest rank of demons, named the Kālakañjas. And when you die, they’ll throw you in the charnel ground on a clump of vetiver. But by eating just a little food and drinking just a little water, you’ll prove what the ascetic Gotama says to be false.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.8.8">Then Sunakkhatta counted up the days until the seventh day, as happens when you have no faith in the Realized One. But on the seventh day, the naked ascetic Korakkhattiya died of flatulence. And when he passed away, he was reborn in the very lowest rank of demons, named the Kālakañjas. And when he passed away, they threw him in the charnel ground on a clump of vetiver. </p>
<p id="dn24:1.9.1">Sunakkhatta the Licchavi heard about this. So he went to see Korakkhattiya in the charnel ground on the clump of vetiver. There he struck Korakkhattiya with his fist three times, ‘Reverend Korakkhattiya, do you know your destiny?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.9.5">Then Korakkhattiya got up, rubbing his back with his hands, and said, ‘Reverend Sunakkhatta, I know my own destiny. I’ve been reborn in the very lowest rank of demons, named the Kālakañjas.’ After speaking, he fell flat right there. </p>
<p id="dn24:1.10.1">Then Sunakkhatta came to me, bowed, and sat down to one side. I said to him, ‘What do you think, Sunakkhatta? Did the declaration I made about Korakkhattiya turn out to be correct, or not?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.10.4">‘It turned out to be correct.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.10.5">‘What do you think, Sunakkhatta? If that is so, has a superhuman demonstration of psychic power been performed or not?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.10.7">‘Clearly, sir, a superhuman demonstration of psychic power has been performed.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.10.8">‘Though I performed such a superhuman demonstration of psychic power you say this: “But sir, the Buddha never performs any superhuman demonstrations of psychic power for me.” See how far you have strayed!’ Though I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this, he still left this teaching and training, like someone on the highway to hell. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">3. On the Naked Ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka </h3>
<p id="dn24:1.11.1">This one time, Bhaggava, I was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Now at that time the naked ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka was residing in Vesālī. And in the Vajjian capital he had reached the peak of material possessions and fame. He had undertaken these seven vows. ‘As long as I live, I will be a naked ascetic, not wearing clothes. As long as I live, I will be celibate, not having sex. As long as I live, I will consume only meat and alcohol, not eating rice and porridge. And I will not go past the following tree-shrines near Vesālī: the Udena shrine to the east, the Gotamaka to the south, the Sattamba to the west, and the Bahuputta to the north.’ And it was due to undertaking these seven vows that he had reached the peak of material possessions and fame. </p>
<p id="dn24:1.12.1">So, Bhaggava, Sunakkhatta went to see Kaḷāramaṭṭaka and asked him a question. But when it stumped him, he displayed annoyance, hate, and bitterness. So Sunakkhatta thought, ‘I’ve offended the holy man, the perfected one, the ascetic. I mustn’t create lasting harm and suffering for myself!’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.13.1">Then Sunakkhatta came to me, bowed, and sat down to one side. I said to him, ‘Don’t you claim to be an ascetic, a follower of the Sakyan, you silly man?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.13.3">‘But why does the Buddha say this to me?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.13.5">‘Didn’t you go to see the naked ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka and ask him a question? But when it stumped him, you displayed annoyance, hate, and bitterness. Then you thought, “I’ve offended the holy man, the perfected one, the ascetic. I mustn’t create lasting harm and suffering for myself!”’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.13.11">‘Yes, sir. But sir, are you jealous of perfected ones?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.13.13">‘I’m not jealous of the perfected ones, you silly man. Rather, you should give up this harmful misconception that has arisen in you. Don’t create lasting harm and suffering for yourself! </p>
<p id="dn24:1.13.16">That naked ascetic Kaḷāramaṭṭaka, who you imagine to be a true holy man, will shortly be clothed, living with a partner, eating rice and porridge, having gone past all the shrines near Vesālī. And he will die after losing all his fame.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.13.18">And that’s exactly what happened. </p>
<p id="dn24:1.14.1">Sunakkhatta heard about this. He came to me, bowed, and sat down to one side. I said to him, ‘What do you think, Sunakkhatta? Did the declaration I made about Kaḷāramaṭṭaka turn out to be correct, or not?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.14.6">‘It turned out to be correct.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.14.7">‘What do you think, Sunakkhatta? If that is so, has a superhuman demonstration of psychic power been performed or not?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.14.9">‘Clearly, sir, a superhuman demonstration of psychic power has been performed.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.14.10">‘Though I perform such a superhuman demonstration of psychic power you say this: “But sir, the Buddha never performs any superhuman demonstrations of psychic power for me.” See how far you have strayed!’ Though I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this, he still left this teaching and training, like someone on the highway to hell. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">4. On the Naked Ascetic Pāṭikaputta </h3>
<p id="dn24:1.15.1">This one time, Bhaggava, I was staying right there near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Now at that time the naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta was residing in Vesālī. And in the Vajjian capital he had reached the peak of material possessions and fame. He was telling a crowd in Vesālī: ‘Both the ascetic Gotama and I speak from knowledge. One who speaks from knowledge ought to display a superhuman demonstration of psychic power to another who speaks from knowledge. If the ascetic Gotama meets me half-way, there we should both perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power. If he performs one demonstration of psychic power, I’ll perform two. If he performs two, I’ll perform four. If he performs four, I’ll perform eight. However many demonstrations of psychic power the ascetic Gotama performs, I’ll perform double.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.16.1">Then Sunakkhatta came to me, bowed, sat down to one side, and told me of all this. </p>
<p id="dn24:1.16.12">I said to him, ‘Sunakkhatta, the naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is not capable of coming into my presence, unless he gives up that statement and that intention, and lets go of that view. If he thinks he can come into my presence without giving up those things, his head may explode.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.17.1">‘Careful what you say, Blessed One! Careful what you say, Holy One!’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.17.2">‘But why do you say this to me, Sunakkhatta?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.17.4">‘Sir, the Buddha has definitively asserted that Pāṭikaputta is not capable of coming into the Buddha’s presence, otherwise his head may explode. But Pāṭikaputta might come into the Buddha’s presence in disguise, proving the Buddha wrong.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.18.1">‘Sunakkhatta, would the Realized One make an ambiguous statement?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.18.2">‘But sir, did you make that statement after comprehending Pāṭikaputta’s mind with your mind? Or did deities tell you about it?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.18.10">‘Both, Sunakkhatta. For Ajita the Licchavi general has recently passed away and been reborn in the host of the Thirty-Three. He came and told me this, “The naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is shameless, sir, he is a liar. For he has declared of me in the Vajjian capital: ‘Ajita the Licchavi general has been reborn in the Great Hell.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.18.24">But that is not true—I have been reborn in the host of the Thirty-Three. The naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is shameless, sir, he is a liar. Pāṭikaputta is not capable of coming into the Buddha’s presence, otherwise his head may explode.” </p>
<p id="dn24:1.18.31">Thus I both made that statement after comprehending Pāṭikaputta’s mind with my mind, and deities told me about it. </p>
<p id="dn24:1.18.38">So Sunakkhatta, I’ll wander for alms in Vesālī. After the meal, on my return from almsround, I’ll go to Pāṭikaputta’s monastery for the day’s meditation. Now you may tell him, if you so wish.’ </p>
<h3 class="subheading">5. On Demonstrations of Psychic Power </h3>
<p id="dn24:1.19.1">Then, Bhaggava, I robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms. After the meal, on my return from almsround, I went to Pāṭikaputta’s monastery for the day’s meditation. Then Sunakkhatta rushed into Vesālī to see the very well-known Licchavis and said to them, ‘Sirs, after his almsround, the Buddha has gone to Pāṭikaputta’s monastery for the day’s meditation. Come forth, sirs, come forth! There will be a superhuman demonstration of psychic power by the holy ascetics!’ So the very well-known Licchavis thought, ‘It seems there will be a superhuman demonstration of psychic power by the holy ascetics! Let’s go!’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.19.9">Then he went to see the very well-known well-to-do brahmins, rich householders, and ascetics and brahmins who follow various other paths, and said the same thing. They all said, ‘It seems there will be a superhuman demonstration of psychic power by the holy ascetics! Let’s go!’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.19.15">Then all those very well-known people went to Pāṭikaputta’s monastery. That assembly was large, Bhaggava; there were many hundreds, many thousands of them. </p>
<p id="dn24:1.20.1">Pāṭikaputta heard, ‘It seems that very well-known Licchavis, well-to-do brahmins, rich householders, and ascetics and brahmins who follow various other paths have come forth. And the ascetic Gotama is sitting in my monastery for the day’s meditation.’ When he heard that, he became frightened, scared, his hair standing on end. In fear he went to the Pale-Moon Ebony Trunk Monastery of the wanderers. </p>
<p id="dn24:1.20.6">The assembly heard of this, and instructed a man, ‘Come, my man, go to see Pāṭikaputta at the Pale-Moon Ebony Trunk Monastery and say to him, “Come forth, Reverend Pāṭikaputta! All these very well-known people have come forth, and the ascetic Gotama is sitting in your monastery for the day’s meditation. For you stated this in the assembly at Vesālī: ‘Both the ascetic Gotama and I speak from knowledge. One who speaks from knowledge ought to display a superhuman demonstration of psychic power to another who speaks from knowledge. If the ascetic Gotama meets me half-way, there we should both perform a superhuman demonstration of psychic power. If he performs one demonstration of psychic power, I’ll perform two. If he performs two, I’ll perform four. If he performs four, I’ll perform eight. However many demonstrations of psychic power the ascetic Gotama performs, I’ll perform double.’ Come forth, Reverend Pāṭikaputta, half-way. The ascetic Gotama has come the first half, and is sitting in your monastery.”’ </p>
<p id="dn24:1.21.1">‘Yes, sir,’ replied that man, and delivered the message. </p>
<p id="dn24:1.21.10">When he had spoken, Pāṭika said: ‘I’m coming, sir, I’m coming!’ But wriggle as he might, he couldn’t get up from his seat. Then that man said to Pāṭikaputta, ‘What’s up, Reverend Pāṭikaputta? Is your bottom stuck to the bench, or is the bench stuck to your bottom? You say “I’m coming, sir, I’m coming!” But wriggle as you might, you can’t get up from your seat.’ And as he was speaking, Pāṭika said: ‘I’m coming, sir, I’m coming!’ But wriggle as he might, he couldn’t get up from his seat. </p>
<p id="dn24:1.22.1">When that man knew that Pāṭikaputta had lost, he returned to the assembly and said, ‘Pāṭikaputta has lost, sirs. He says “I’m coming, sir, I’m coming!” But wriggle as he might, he can’t get up from his seat.’ When he said this, I said to the assembly, ‘The naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is not capable of coming into my presence, unless he gives up that statement and that intention, and lets go of that view. If he thinks he can come into my presence without giving up those things, his head may explode.’ </p>
<p class="endsection" id="dn24:1.22.11">The first recitation section is finished. </p>
<p id="dn24:2.1.1">Then, Bhaggava, a certain Licchavi minister stood up and said to the assembly, ‘Well then, sirs, wait a moment, I’ll go. Hopefully I’ll be able to lead Pāṭikaputta back to the assembly.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:2.1.4">So that minister went to see Pāṭikaputta and said, ‘Come forth, Reverend Pāṭikaputta! It’s best for you to come forth. All these very well-known people have come forth, and the ascetic Gotama is sitting in your monastery for the day’s meditation. You said you’d meet the ascetic Gotama half-way. The ascetic Gotama has come the first half, and is sitting in your monastery. The ascetic Gotama has told the assembly that you’re not capable of coming into his presence. Come forth, Pāṭikaputta! When you come forth we’ll make you win and the ascetic Gotama lose.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:2.2.1">When he had spoken, Pāṭikaputta said: ‘I’m coming, sir, I’m coming!’ But wriggle as he might, he couldn’t get up from his seat. Then the minister said to Pāṭikaputta, ‘What’s up, Reverend Pāṭikaputta? Is your bottom stuck to the bench, or is the bench stuck to your bottom? You say “I’m coming, sir, I’m coming!” But wriggle as you might, you can’t get up from your seat.’ And as he was speaking, Pāṭikaputta said: ‘I’m coming, sir, I’m coming!’ But wriggle as he might, he couldn’t get up from his seat. </p>
<p id="dn24:2.3.1">When the Licchavi minister knew that Pāṭikaputta had lost, he returned to the assembly and said, ‘Pāṭikaputta has lost, sirs.’ When he said this, I said to the assembly, ‘Pāṭikaputta is not capable of coming into my presence, otherwise his head may explode. Even if the good Licchavis were to think, “Let’s bind Pāṭikaputta with straps and drag him with a pair of oxen!” But either the straps will break or Pāṭikaputta will.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:2.4.1">Then, Bhaggava, Jāliya, the pupil of the wood-bowl ascetic, stood up and said to the assembly, ‘Well then, sirs, wait a moment, I’ll go. Hopefully I’ll be able to lead Pāṭikaputta back to the assembly.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:2.4.4">So Jāliya went to see Pāṭikaputta and said, ‘Come forth, Reverend Pāṭikaputta! It’s best for you to come forth. All these very well-known people have come forth, and the ascetic Gotama is sitting in your monastery for the day’s meditation. You said you’d meet the ascetic Gotama half-way. The ascetic Gotama has come the first half, and is sitting in your monastery. The ascetic Gotama has told the assembly that you’re not capable of coming into his presence. And he said that even if the Licchavis try to bind you with straps and drag you with a pair of oxen, either the straps will break or you will. Come forth, Pāṭikaputta! When you come forth we’ll make you win and the ascetic Gotama lose.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:2.5.1">When he had spoken, Pāṭikaputta said: ‘I’m coming, sir, I’m coming!’ But wriggle as he might, he couldn’t get up from his seat. Then Jāliya said to Pāṭikaputta, ‘What’s up, Reverend Pāṭikaputta? Is your bottom stuck to the bench, or is the bench stuck to your bottom? You say “I’m coming, sir, I’m coming!” But wriggle as you might, you can’t get up from your seat.’ And as he was speaking, Pāṭikaputta said: ‘I’m coming, sir, I’m coming!’ But wriggle as he might, he couldn’t get up from his seat. </p>
<p id="dn24:2.6.1">When Jāliya knew that Pāṭikaputta had lost, he said to him, </p>
<p id="dn24:2.6.3">‘Once upon a time, Reverend Pāṭikaputta, it occurred to a lion, king of beasts, “Why don’t I make my lair near a certain forest? Towards evening I can emerge from my den, yawn, look all around the four quarters, roar my lion’s roar three times, and set out on the hunt. Having slain the very best of the deer herd, and eaten the most tender flesh, I could return to my den.” </p>
<p id="dn24:2.6.7">And so that’s what he did. </p>
<p id="dn24:2.6.10">Now, there was an old jackal who had grown fat on the lion’s leavings, becoming arrogant and strong. He thought, “What does the lion, king of beasts, have that I don’t? Why don’t I also make my lair near a certain forest? Towards evening I can emerge from my den, yawn, look all around the four quarters, roar my lion’s roar three times, and set out on the hunt. Having slain the very best of the deer herd, and eaten the most tender flesh, I could return to my den.” </p>
<p id="dn24:2.7.1">And so that’s what he did. But when he tried to roar a lion’s roar, he only managed to squeal and yelp like a jackal. And what is a pathetic jackal’s squeal next to the roar of a lion? </p>
<p id="dn24:2.7.3">In the same way, reverend, while living on the harvest of the Holy One, enjoying the leftovers of the Holy One, you presume to attack the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! Who are the pathetic Pāṭikaputtas to attack the Realized Ones, the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:2.8.1">When Jāliya couldn’t get Pāṭikaputta to shift from his seat even with this simile, he said to him: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn24:2.8.3">‘Seeing himself as equal to the lion, <br/>the jackal presumed “I’m the king of the beasts!” <br/>But in reality he only managed to yelp, <br/>and what’s a sad jackal’s squeal to the roar of a lion? </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn24:2.8.7">In the same way, reverend, while living on the harvest of the Holy One, you presume to attack him!’ </p>
<p id="dn24:2.9.1">When Jāliya couldn’t get Pāṭikaputta to shift from his seat even with this simile, he said to him: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn24:2.9.3">‘Following in the steps of another, <br/>seeing himself grown fat on scraps, <br/>until he doesn’t even see himself, <br/>the jackal presumes he’s a tiger. </p>
<p id="dn24:2.9.7">But in reality he only managed to yelp, <br/>and what’s a sad jackal’s squeal to the roar of a lion? </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn24:2.9.9">In the same way, reverend, while living on the harvest of the Holy One, you presume to attack him!’ </p>
<p id="dn24:2.10.1">When Jāliya couldn’t get Pāṭikaputta to shift from his seat even with this simile, he said to him: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn24:2.10.3">‘Gorged on frogs, and mice from the barn, <br/>and carcasses tossed in the cemetery, <br/>thriving in the great, empty wood, <br/>the jackal presumed “I’m the king of the beasts!” <br/>But in reality he only managed to yelp, <br/>and what’s a sad jackal’s squeal to the roar of a lion? </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn24:2.10.9">In the same way, reverend, while living on the harvest of the Holy One, enjoying the leftovers of the Holy One, you presume to attack the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! Who are the pathetic Pāṭikaputtas to attack the Realized Ones, the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:2.11.1">When Jāliya couldn’t get Pāṭikaputta to shift from his seat even with this simile, he returned to the assembly and said, ‘Pāṭikaputta has lost, sirs. He says “I’m coming, sir, I’m coming!” But wriggle as he might, he can’t get up from his seat.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:2.12.1">When he said this, I said to the assembly, ‘The naked ascetic Pāṭikaputta is not capable of coming into my presence, unless he gives up that statement and that intention, and lets go of that view. If he thinks he can come into my presence without giving up those things, his head may explode. The good Licchavis might even think, “Let’s bind Pāṭikaputta with straps and drag him with a pair of oxen!” But either the straps will break or Pāṭikaputta will. Pāṭikaputta is not capable of coming into my presence, otherwise his head may explode.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:2.13.1">Then, Bhaggava, I educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired that assembly with a Dhamma talk. I released that assembly from the great bondage, and lifted 84,000 beings from the great swamp. Next I entered upon the fire element, rose into the sky to the height of seven palm trees, and created a flame another seven palm trees high, blazing and smoking. Finally I landed at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. </p>
<p id="dn24:2.13.2">Then Sunakkhatta came to me, bowed, and sat down to one side. I said to him, ‘What do you think, Sunakkhatta? Did the declaration I made about Pāṭikaputta turn out to be correct, or not?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:2.13.5">‘It turned out to be correct.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:2.13.6">‘What do you think, Sunakkhatta? If that is so, has a superhuman demonstration of psychic power been performed or not?’ </p>
<p id="dn24:2.13.8">‘Clearly, sir, a superhuman demonstration of psychic power has been performed.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:2.13.9">‘Though I perform such a superhuman demonstration of psychic power you say this: “But sir, the Buddha never performs any superhuman demonstrations of psychic power for me.” See how far you have strayed!’ </p>
<p id="dn24:2.13.12">Though I spoke to Sunakkhatta like this, he still left this teaching and training, like someone on the highway to hell. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">6. On Describing the Origin of the World </h3>
<p id="dn24:2.14.1">Bhaggava, I understand the origin of the world. I understand this, and what goes beyond it. Yet since I do not misapprehend that understanding, I have realized extinguishment within myself. Directly knowing this, the Realized One does not come to ruin. </p>
<p id="dn24:2.14.3">There are some ascetics and brahmins who describe the origin of the world in their tradition as created by the Lord God, by Brahmā. I go up to them and say, ‘Is it really true that this is the venerables’ view?’ And they answer, ‘Yes’. I say to them, ‘But how do you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about as created by the Lord God, by Brahmā?’ But they are stumped by my question, and they even question me in return. So I answer them, </p>
<p id="dn24:2.14.11">‘There comes a time when, reverends, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos contracts. As the cosmos contracts, sentient beings are mostly headed for the realm of streaming radiance. There they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time. </p>
<p id="dn24:2.15.1">There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos expands. As it expands an empty mansion of Brahmā appears. Then a certain sentient being—due to the running out of their life-span or merit—passes away from that host of radiant deities and is reborn in that empty mansion of Brahmā. There they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time. </p>
<p id="dn24:2.16.1">But after staying there all alone for a long time, they become dissatisfied and anxious, “Oh, if only another being would come to this state of existence.” </p>
<p id="dn24:2.16.3">Then other sentient beings—due to the running out of their life-span or merit—pass away from that host of radiant deities and are reborn in that empty mansion of Brahmā in company with that being. There they too are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time. </p>
<p id="dn24:2.17.1">Now, the being who was reborn there first thinks, “I am Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born. Why is that? Because first I thought, ‘Oh, if only another being would come to this state of existence.’ Such was my heart’s wish, and then these creatures came to this state of existence.” </p>
<p id="dn24:2.17.7">And the beings who were reborn there later also think, “This must be Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born. And we have been created by him. Why is that? Because we see that he was reborn here first, and we arrived later.” </p>
<p id="dn24:2.17.12">And the being who was reborn first is more long-lived, beautiful, and illustrious than those who arrived later. </p>
<p id="dn24:2.17.14">It’s possible that one of those beings passes away from that host and is reborn in this state of existence. Having done so, they go forth from the lay life to homelessness. By dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus, they experience an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect that past life, but no further. </p>
<p id="dn24:2.17.17">They say: “He who is Brahmā—the Great Brahmā, the Undefeated, the Champion, the Universal Seer, the Wielder of Power, the Lord God, the Maker, the Author, the First, the Begetter, the Controller, the Father of those who have been born and those yet to be born—is permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity. We who were created by that Brahmā are impermanent, not lasting, short-lived, perishable, and have come to this state of existence.” This is how you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about as created by the Lord God, by Brahmā.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:2.17.21">They say, ‘That is what we have heard, Reverend Gotama, just as you say.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:2.17.23">Bhaggava, I understand the origin of the world. I understand this, and what goes beyond it. Yet since I do not misapprehend that understanding, I have realized extinguishment within myself. Directly knowing this, the Realized One does not come to ruin. </p>
<p id="dn24:2.18.1">There are some ascetics and brahmins who describe the origin of the world in their tradition as due to those depraved by play. I go up to them and say, ‘Is it really true that this is the venerables’ view?’ And they answer, ‘Yes’. I say to them, ‘But how do you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about due to those depraved by play?’ But they are stumped by my question, and they even question me in return. So I answer them, </p>
<p id="dn24:2.18.9">‘Reverends, there are gods named “depraved by play”. They spend too much time laughing, playing, and making merry. And in doing so, they lose their mindfulness, and they pass away from that host of gods. </p>

<p id="dn24:2.18.13">They say, “The gods not depraved by play don’t spend too much time laughing, playing, and making merry. So they don’t lose their mindfulness, and don’t pass away from that host of gods. They are permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, remaining the same for all eternity. But we who were depraved by play spent too much time laughing, playing, and making merry. In doing so, we lost our mindfulness, and passed away from that host of gods. We are impermanent, not lasting, short-lived, perishable, and have come to this state of existence.” This is how you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about due to those depraved by play.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:2.18.19">They say, ‘That is what we have heard, Reverend Gotama, just as you say.’ </p>
<p id="dn24:2.18.21">Bhaggava, I understand the origin of the world. Directly knowing this, the Realized One does not come to ruin. </p>
<p id="dn24:2.19.1">There are some ascetics and brahmins who describe the origin of the world in their tradition as due to those who are malevolent. I go up to them and say, ‘Is it really true that this is the venerables’ view?’ And they answer, ‘Yes’. I say to them, ‘But how do you describe in your tradition that the origin of the world came about due to those who are malevolent?’ But they are stumped by my question, and they even question me in return. So I answer them, </p>
<p id="dn24:2.19.9">‘Reverends, there are gods named “malevolent”. They spend too much time gazing at each other, so they grow angry with each other, and their bodies and minds get tired. They pass away from that host of gods. </p>

<p id="dn24:2.21.1">Though I speak and explain like this, certain ascetics and brahmins misrepresent me with the false, hollow, lying, untruthful claim: ‘The ascetic Gotama has a distorted perspective, and so have his monks. </p>
<p id="dn24:2.21.3">He says, “When one enters and remains in the liberation of the beautiful, at that time one only perceives what is ugly.”’ </p>
<p id="dn24:2.21.5">But I don’t say that. I say this: ‘When one enters and remains in the liberation of the beautiful, at that time one only perceives what is beautiful.’” </p>
<p id="dn24:2.21.9">“They are the ones with a distorted perspective, sir, who regard the Buddha and the mendicants in this way. Sir, I am quite confident that the Buddha is capable of teaching me so that I can enter and remain in the liberation on the beautiful.” </p>
<p id="dn24:2.21.11">“It’s hard for you to enter and remain in the liberation on the beautiful, since you have a different view, creed, preference, practice, and tradition. Come now, Bhaggava, carefully preserve the confidence that you have in me.” </p>
<p id="dn24:2.21.13">“If it’s hard for me to enter and remain in the liberation on the beautiful, since I have a different view, creed, preference, practice, and tradition, I shall carefully preserve the confidence that I have in the Buddha.” </p>
<p id="dn24:2.21.15">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the wanderer Bhaggavagotta was happy with what the Buddha said. </p>

<h3 class="subheading">1. The Story of the Wanderer Nigrodha </h3>
<p id="dn25:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. </p>
<p id="dn25:1.3">Now at that time the wanderer Nigrodha was residing in the lady Udumbarikā’s monastery for wanderers, together with a large assembly of three thousand wanderers. Then the householder Sandhāna left Rājagaha in the middle of the day to see the Buddha. </p>
<p id="dn25:1.5">Then it occurred to him, “It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha, as he’s in retreat. And it’s the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicants, as they’re in retreat. Why don’t I visit the wanderer Nigrodha at the lady Udumbarikā’s monastery for wanderers?” So he went to the monastery of the wanderers. </p>
<p id="dn25:2.1">Now at that time, Nigrodha was sitting together with a large assembly of wanderers making an uproar, a dreadful racket. They engaged in all kinds of unworthy talk, such as talk about kings, bandits, and ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and well talk; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence. </p>
<p id="dn25:3.1">Nigrodha saw Sandhāna coming off in the distance, and hushed his own assembly: “Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound. The householder Sandhāna, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is coming. He is included among the white-clothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing near Rājagaha. Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise the quiet. Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.” Then those wanderers fell silent. </p>
<p id="dn25:4.1">Then Sandhāna went up to the wanderer Nigrodha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Nigrodha, “The way the wanderers make an uproar as they sit together and talk about all kinds of unworthy topics is one thing. It’s quite different to the way the Buddha frequents remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest that are quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat.” </p>
<p id="dn25:5.1">When Sandhāna said this, Nigrodha said to him, “Surely, householder, you should know better! With whom does the ascetic Gotama converse? With whom does he engage in discussion? With whom does he achieve lucidity of wisdom? Staying in empty huts has destroyed the ascetic Gotama’s wisdom. Not frequenting assemblies, he is unable to hold a discussion. He just lurks on the periphery. He’s just like the nilgai antelope, circling around and lurking on the periphery. Please, householder, let the ascetic Gotama come to this assembly. I’ll sink him with just one question! I’ll roll him over and wrap him up like a hollow pot!” </p>
<p id="dn25:6.1">With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha heard this discussion between the householder Sandhāna and the wanderer Nigrodha. Then the Buddha descended Vulture’s Peak Mountain and went to the peacocks’ feeding ground on the bank of the Sumāgadhā, where he walked mindfully in the open air. </p>
<p id="dn25:6.3">Nigrodha saw him, and hushed his own assembly: “Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound. The ascetic Gotama is walking mindfully on the bank of the Sumāgadhā. The venerable likes quiet and praises quiet. Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach. If he comes, I’ll ask him this question: ‘Sir, what teaching do you use to guide your disciples, through which they claim solace in the fundamental purpose of the spiritual life?’” Then those wanderers fell silent. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. Mortification in Disgust of Sin </h3>
<p id="dn25:7.1">Then the Buddha went up to the wanderer Nigrodha, who said to him, “Come, Blessed One! Welcome, Blessed One! It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here. Please, sir, sit down, this seat is ready.” The Buddha sat on the seat spread out, while Nigrodha took a low seat and sat to one side. The Buddha said to him, “Nigrodha, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?” </p>
<p id="dn25:7.10">Nigrodha said, “Well, sir, I saw you walking mindfully and said: ‘If the ascetic Gotama comes, I’ll ask him this question: “Sir, what teaching do you use to guide your disciples, through which they claim solace in the fundamental purpose of the spiritual life?”’ This is the conversation that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.” </p>
<p id="dn25:7.15">“It’s hard for you to understand this, Nigrodha, since you have a different view, creed, preference, practice, and tradition. Please ask me a question about the higher mortification in disgust of sin in your own tradition: ‘How are the conditions for the mortification in disgust of sin completed, and how are they incomplete?’” </p>
<p id="dn25:7.18">When he said this, those wanderers made an uproar, “It’s incredible, it’s amazing! The ascetic Gotama has such power and might! For he sets aside his own doctrine and invites discussion on the doctrine of others!” </p>
<p id="dn25:8.1">Then Nigrodha, having quieted those wanderers, said to the Buddha, “Sir, we teach mortification in disgust of sin, regarding it as essential and clinging to it. How are the conditions for the mortification in disgust of sin completed, and how are they incomplete?” </p>
<p id="dn25:8.4">“It’s when a mortifier goes naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on purpose for them, or an invitation for a meal. They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breast-feeding, or who has a man in her home; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or liquor or wine, and drink no beer. They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls. They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day. They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live committed to the practice of eating food at set intervals. They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit. They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings. They tear out their hair and beard, committed to this practice. They constantly stand, refusing seats. They squat, committed to persisting in the squatting position. They lie on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns their bed. They make their bed on a plank, or the bare ground. They lie only on one side. They wear dust and dirt. They stay in the open air. They sleep wherever they lay their mat. They eat unnatural things, committed to the practice of eating unnatural foods. They don’t drink, committed to the practice of not drinking liquids. They’re committed to the practice of immersion in water three times a day, including the evening. </p>
<p id="dn25:8.22">What do you think, Nigrodha? If this is so, is the mortification in disgust of sin complete, or incomplete?” </p>
<p id="dn25:8.24">“Clearly, sir, if that is so the mortification in disgust of sin is complete, not incomplete.” </p>
<p id="dn25:8.25">“But even such a completed mortification has many defects, I say.” </p>

But what does agree with them they eat tied, infatuated, attached, blind to the drawbacks, and not understanding the escape. This too is a defect in that mortifier. </p>
<p id="dn25:10.15">Furthermore, a mortifier undertakes a practice of mortification out of longing for possessions, honor, and popularity, thinking, ‘Kings, royal ministers, aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and sectarians will honor me!’ This too is a defect in that mortifier. </p>

<p id="dn25:11.5">Furthermore, a mortifier sees a certain ascetic or brahmin being honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated among good families. They think, ‘This one, who lives in abundance, is honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated among good families.

<p id="dn25:12.1">Furthermore, a mortifier disagrees with the way that the Realized One or their disciple teaches Dhamma, even when they make a valid point. This too is a defect in that mortifier. </p>

<p id="dn25:16.3">“Nigrodha, take a mortifier who is restrained in the fourfold restraint. And how is a mortifier restrained in the fourfold restraint? It’s when a mortifier doesn’t kill living creatures, doesn’t get others to kill, and doesn’t approve of killing. They don’t steal, get others to steal, or approve of stealing. They don’t lie, get others to lie, or approve of lying. They don’t expect rewards from their practice, they don’t lead others to expect rewards, and they don’t approve of expecting rewards. That’s how a mortifier is restrained in the fourfold restraint. </p>
<p id="dn25:16.10">When a mortifier has the fourfold restraint, that is their mortification. They step forward, not falling back. They frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there. Giving up desire for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of desire, cleansing the mind of desire. Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will. Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness. Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse. Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt. </p>
<p id="dn25:17.1">They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Then they meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion … They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing … They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth.

<p id="dn25:18.13">They recollect many kinds of past lives, that is, one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended.

<p id="dn25:19.12">With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place.

<p id="dn25:19.16">“Nigrodha, at this point the mortification in disgust of sin has reached the peak and the pith. Nigrodha, remember you said this to me: ‘Sir, what teaching do you use to guide your disciples, through which they claim solace in the fundamental purpose of the spiritual life?’ Well, there is something better and finer than this. That’s what I use to guide my disciples, through which they claim solace in the fundamental purpose of the spiritual life.” </p>
<p id="dn25:19.20">When he said this, those wanderers made an uproar, “In that case, we’re lost, and so is our tradition! We don’t know anything better or finer than that!” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">4. Nigrodha Feels Depressed </h3>
<p id="dn25:20.1">Then the householder Sandhāna realized, “Obviously, now these wanderers want to listen to what the Buddha says. They’re paying attention and applying their minds to understand!” </p>
<p id="dn25:20.3">So he said to the wanderer Nigrodha, “Nigrodha, remember you said this to me: ‘Surely, householder, you should know better! With whom does the ascetic Gotama converse? With whom does he engage in discussion? With whom does he achieve lucidity of wisdom? Staying in empty huts has destroyed the ascetic Gotama’s wisdom. Not frequenting assemblies, he is unable to hold a discussion. He just lurks on the periphery. He’s just like the nilgai antelope, circling around and lurking on the periphery. Please, householder, let the ascetic Gotama come to this assembly. I’ll sink him with just one question! I’ll roll him over and wrap him up like a hollow pot!’ Now the Blessed One, perfected and fully awakened, has arrived here. Why don’t you send him out of the assembly to the periphery like a nilgai antelope? Why don’t you sink him with just one question? Why don’t you roll him over and wrap him up like a hollow pot?” When he said this, Nigrodha sat silent, embarrassed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say. </p>
<p id="dn25:21.1">Knowing this, the Buddha said to him, “Is it really true, Nigrodha—are those your words?” </p>
<p id="dn25:21.3">“It’s true, sir, those are my words. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me.” </p>
<p id="dn25:21.4">“What do you think, Nigrodha? Have you heard that wanderers of the past who were elderly and senior, the teachers of teachers, said that when the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas of the past came together, they made an uproar, a dreadful racket as they sat and talked about all kinds of unworthy topics, like you do in your tradition these days? Or did they say that the Buddhas frequented remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest that are quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat, like I do these days?” </p>
<p id="dn25:21.10">“I have heard that wanderers of the past who were elderly and senior, said that when the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas of the past came together, they didn’t make an uproar, like I do in my tradition these days. They said that the Buddhas of the past frequented remote lodgings in the wilderness, like the Buddha does these days.” </p>
<p id="dn25:21.15">“Nigrodha, you are a sensible and mature man. Did it not occur to you: ‘The Blessed One is awakened, tamed, serene, crossed over, and extinguished. And he teaches Dhamma for awakening, taming, serenity, crossing over, and extinguishment’?” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">5. The Culmination of the Spiritual Path </h3>
<p id="dn25:22.1">Nigrodha said, “I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to speak in that way. Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.” </p>
<p id="dn25:22.4">“Indeed, Nigrodha, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to speak in that way. But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it. For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future. Nigrodha, this is what I say: </p>
<p id="dn25:22.8">Let a sensible person come—neither devious nor deceitful, a person of integrity. I teach and instruct them. By practicing as instructed they will realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life, in seven years. They will live having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. Let alone seven years. Let a sensible person come—neither devious nor deceitful, a person of integrity. I teach and instruct them. By practicing as instructed they will realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life, in six years … five years … four years … three years … two years … one year … seven months … six months … five months … four months … three months … two months … one month … a fortnight. Let alone a fortnight. Let a sensible person come—neither devious nor deceitful, a person of integrity. I teach and instruct them. By practicing as instructed they will realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life, in seven days. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">6. The Wanderers Feel Depressed </h3>
<p id="dn25:23.1">Nigrodha, you might think, ‘The ascetic Gotama speaks like this because he wants pupils.’ But you should not see it like this. Let your teacher remain your teacher. </p>
<p id="dn25:23.5">You might think, ‘The ascetic Gotama speaks like this because he wants us to give up our recitation.’ But you should not see it like this. Let your recitation remain as it is. </p>
<p id="dn25:23.9">You might think, ‘The ascetic Gotama speaks like this because he wants us to give up our livelihood.’ But you should not see it like this. Let your livelihood remain as it is. </p>
<p id="dn25:23.13">You might think, ‘The ascetic Gotama speaks like this because he wants us to start doing things that are unskillful and considered unskillful in our tradition.’ But you should not see it like this. Let those things that are unskillful and considered unskillful in your tradition remain as they are. </p>
<p id="dn25:23.17">You might think, ‘The ascetic Gotama speaks like this because he wants us to stop doing things that are skillful and considered skillful in our tradition.’ But you should not see it like this. Let those things that are skillful and considered skillful in your tradition remain as they are. </p>
<p id="dn25:23.21">I do not speak for any of these reasons. Nigrodha, there are things that are unskillful, corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death. I teach Dhamma so that those things may be given up. When you practice accordingly, corrupting qualities will be given up in you and cleansing qualities will grow. You’ll enter and remain in the fullness and abundance of wisdom, having realized it with your own insight in this very life.” </p>
<p id="dn25:24.1">When this was said, those wanderers sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say, as if their minds were possessed by Māra. Then the Buddha thought, “All these foolish people have been touched by the Wicked One! For not even a single one thinks, ‘Come, let us lead the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama for the sake of enlightenment—for what do seven days matter?’” </p>
<p id="dn25:24.6">Then the Buddha, having roared his lion’s roar in the lady Udumbarikā’s monastery for wanderers, rose into the air and landed on Vulture’s Peak. Meanwhile, the householder Sandhāna just went back to Rājagaha. </p>

<h3 class="subheading">1. Taking Refuge in Oneself </h3>
<p id="dn26:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans at Mātulā. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>
<p id="dn26:1.5">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="dn26:1.7">“Mendicants, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge. And how does a mendicant do this? They meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. That’s how a mendicant lives as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how they let the teaching be their island and their refuge, with no other refuge. </p>
<p id="dn26:1.14">You should roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers. If you roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers, Māra won’t catch you or get hold of you. It is due to undertaking skillful qualities that this merit grows. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. King Daḷhanemi </h3>
<p id="dn26:2.1">Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a king named Daḷhanemi who was a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extended to all four sides, he achieved stability in the country, and he possessed the seven treasures. He had the following seven treasures: the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure. He had over a thousand sons who were valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigned by principle, without rod or sword. </p>
<p id="dn26:3.1">Then, after many years, many hundred years, many thousand years had passed, King Daḷhanemi addressed one of his men, ‘My good man, when you see that the heavenly wheel-treasure has receded back from its place, please tell me.’ </p>
<p id="dn26:3.3">‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied that man. </p>
<p id="dn26:3.4">After many thousand years had passed, that man saw that the heavenly wheel-treasure had receded back from its place. So he went to King Daḷhanemi and said, ‘Please sire, you should know that your heavenly wheel-treasure has receded back from its place.’ </p>
<p id="dn26:3.6">So the king summoned the crown prince and said, ‘Dear prince, my heavenly wheel-treasure has receded back from its place. I’ve heard that when this happens to a wheel-turning monarch, he does not have long to live. I have enjoyed human pleasures. Now it is time for me to seek heavenly pleasures. Come, dear prince, rule this land surrounded by ocean! I shall shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.’ </p>
<p id="dn26:3.13">And so, after carefully instructing the crown prince in kingship, King Daḷhanemi shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. Seven days later the heavenly wheel-treasure vanished. </p>
<p id="dn26:4.1">Then a certain man approached the newly anointed aristocrat king and said, ‘Please sire, you should know that the heavenly wheel-treasure has vanished.’ At that the king was unhappy and experienced unhappiness. He went to the royal sage and said, ‘Please sire, you should know that the heavenly wheel-treasure has vanished.’ </p>
<p id="dn26:4.6">When he said this, the royal sage said to him, ‘Don’t be unhappy at the vanishing of the wheel-treasure. My dear, the wheel-treasure is not inherited from your father. Come now, my dear, implement the noble duties of a wheel-turning monarch. If you do so, it’s possible that—on a fifteenth day sabbath, having bathed your head and gone upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbath—the heavenly wheel-treasure will appear to you, with a thousand spokes, with rim and hub, complete in every detail.’ </p>

<p id="dn26:5.2">‘Well then, my dear, relying only on principle—honoring, respecting, and venerating principle, having principle as your flag, banner, and authority—provide just protection and security for your court, troops, aristocrats, vassals, brahmins and householders, people of town and country, ascetics and brahmins, beasts and birds. Do not let injustice prevail in the realm. Pay money to the penniless in the realm. </p>
<p id="dn26:5.5">And there are ascetics and brahmins in the realm who avoid intoxication and negligence, are settled in patience and gentleness, and who tame, calm, and extinguish themselves. From time to time you should go up to them and ask: “Sirs, what is skillful? What is unskillful? What is blameworthy? What is blameless? What should be cultivated? What should not be cultivated? Doing what leads to my lasting harm and suffering? Doing what leads to my lasting welfare and happiness?” Having heard them, you should reject what is unskillful and undertake and follow what is skillful. </p>
<p id="dn26:5.8">These are the noble duties of a wheel-turning monarch.’ </p>
<h4 class="subheading">2.2. The Wheel-Treasure Appears </h4>
<p id="dn26:5.10">‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied the new king to the royal sage. And he implemented the noble duties of a wheel-turning monarch. </p>
<p id="dn26:5.11">While he was implementing them, on a fifteenth day sabbath, he had bathed his head and gone upstairs in the royal longhouse to observe the sabbath. And the heavenly wheel-treasure appeared to him, with a thousand spokes, with rim and hub, complete in every detail. Seeing this, the king thought, ‘I have heard that when the heavenly wheel-treasure appears to a king in this way, he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. Am I then a wheel-turning monarch?’ </p>
<p id="dn26:6.1">Then the anointed king, rising from his seat and arranging his robe over one shoulder, took a ceremonial vase in his left hand and besprinkled the wheel-treasure with his right hand, saying, ‘Roll forth, O wheel-treasure! Triumph, O wheel-treasure!’ </p>
<p id="dn26:6.3">Then the wheel-treasure rolled towards the east. And the king followed it together with his army of four divisions. In whatever place the wheel-treasure stood still, there the king came to stay together with his army. And any opposing rulers of the eastern quarter came to the wheel-turning monarch and said, ‘Come, great king! Welcome, great king! We are yours, great king, instruct us.’ The wheel-turning monarch said, ‘Do not kill living creatures. Do not steal. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not lie. Do not drink alcohol. Maintain the current level of taxation.’ And so the opposing rulers of the eastern quarter became his vassals. </p>
<p id="dn26:7.1">Then the wheel-treasure, having plunged into the eastern ocean and emerged again, rolled towards the south. … Having plunged into the southern ocean and emerged again, it rolled towards the west. … </p>
<p id="dn26:7.9">Having plunged into the western ocean and emerged again, it rolled towards the north, followed by the king together with his army of four divisions. In whatever place the wheel-treasure stood still, there the king came to stay together with his army. And any opposing rulers of the northern quarter came to the wheel-turning monarch and said, ‘Come, great king! Welcome, great king! We are yours, great king, instruct us.’ The wheel-turning monarch said, ‘Do not kill living creatures. Do not steal. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not lie. Do not drink alcohol. Maintain the current level of taxation.’ And so the rulers of the northern quarter became his vassals. </p>
<p id="dn26:7.16">And then the wheel-treasure, having triumphed over this land surrounded by ocean, returned to the royal capital. There it stood still by the gate to the royal compound at the High Court as if fixed to an axle, illuminating the royal compound. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">3. On Subsequent Wheel-Turning Monarchs </h3>
<p id="dn26:8.1">And for a second time, and a third, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth, and a seventh time, a wheel-turning monarch was established in exactly the same way. And after many years the seventh wheel-turning monarch went forth, handing the realm over to the crown prince. </p>
<p id="dn26:8.17">Seven days later the heavenly wheel-treasure vanished. </p>
<p id="dn26:9.1">Then a certain man approached the newly anointed aristocrat king and said, ‘Please sire, you should know that the heavenly wheel-treasure has vanished.’ At that the king was unhappy and experienced unhappiness. But he didn’t go to the royal sage and ask about the noble duties of a wheel-turning monarch. He just governed the country according to his own ideas. So governed, the nations did not prosper like before, as they had when former kings implemented the noble duties of a wheel-turning monarch. </p>
<p id="dn26:9.7">Then the ministers and counselors, the treasury officials, military officers, guardsmen, and advisers gathered and said to the king, ‘Sire, when governed according to your own ideas, the nations do not prosper like before, as they did when former kings implemented the noble duties of a wheel-turning monarch. In your realm are found ministers and counselors, treasury officials, military officers, guardsmen, and advisers—both ourselves and others—who remember the noble duties of a wheel-turning monarch. Please, Your Majesty, ask us about the noble duties of a wheel-turning monarch. We will answer you.’ </p>
<h3 class="subheading">4. On the Period of Decline </h3>
<p id="dn26:10.1">So the anointed king asked the assembled ministers and counselors, treasury officials, military officers, guardsmen, and advisers about the noble duties of a wheel-turning monarch. And they answered him. But after listening to them, he provided just protection and security. But he did not pay money to the penniless in the realm. And so poverty grew widespread. </p>
<p id="dn26:10.5">When poverty was widespread, a certain person stole from others, with the intention to commit theft. They arrested him and presented him to the king, saying, ‘Your Majesty, this person stole from others with the intention to commit theft.’ </p>
<p id="dn26:10.9">The king said to that person, ‘Is it really true, mister, that you stole from others with the intention to commit theft?’ </p>
<p id="dn26:10.11">‘It’s true, sire.’ </p>
<p id="dn26:10.12">‘What was the reason?’ </p>
<p id="dn26:10.13">‘Sire, I can’t survive.’ </p>
<p id="dn26:10.14">So the king paid some money to that person, saying, ‘With this money, mister, keep yourself alive, and provide for your mother and father, partners and children. Work for a living, and establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven.’ </p>
<p id="dn26:10.16">‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied that man. </p>
<p id="dn26:11.1">But then another man stole something from others. They arrested him and presented him to the king, saying, ‘Your Majesty, this person stole from others.’ </p>
<p id="dn26:11.5">The king said to that person, ‘Is it really true, mister, that you stole from others?’ </p>
<p id="dn26:11.7">‘It’s true, sire.’ </p>
<p id="dn26:11.8">‘What was the reason?’ </p>
<p id="dn26:11.9">‘Sire, I can’t survive.’ </p>
<p id="dn26:11.10">So the king paid some money to that person, saying, ‘With this money, mister, keep yourself alive, and provide for your mother and father, partners and children. Work for a living, and establish an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven.’ </p>
<p id="dn26:11.12">‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ replied that man. </p>
<p id="dn26:12.1">People heard about this: ‘It seems the king is paying money to anyone who steals from others!’ It occurred to them, ‘Why don’t we steal from others?’ So then another man stole something from others. </p>
<p id="dn26:12.6">They arrested him and presented him to the king, saying, ‘Your Majesty, this person stole from others.’ </p>
<p id="dn26:12.9">The king said to that person, ‘Is it really true, mister, that you stole from others?’ </p>
<p id="dn26:12.11">‘It’s true, sire.’ </p>
<p id="dn26:12.12">‘What was the reason?’ </p>
<p id="dn26:12.13">‘Sire, I can’t survive.’ </p>
<p id="dn26:12.14">Then the king thought, ‘If I pay money to anyone who steals from others, it will only increase the stealing. I’d better make an end of this person, finish him off, and chop off his head.’ </p>
<p id="dn26:12.17">Then he ordered his men, ‘Well then, my men, tie this man’s arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope. Shave his head and march him from street to street and square to square to the beating of a harsh drum. Then take him out the south gate and make an end of him, finish him off, and chop off his head.’ </p>
<p id="dn26:12.19">‘Yes, Your Majesty,’ they replied, and did as he commanded. </p>
<p id="dn26:13.1">People heard about this: ‘It seems the king is chopping the head off anyone who steals from others!’ It occurred to them, ‘We’d better have sharp swords made. Then when we steal from others, we’ll make an end of them, finish them off, and chop off their heads.’ They had sharp swords made. Then they started to make raids on villages, towns, and cities, and to infest the highways. And they chopped the heads off anyone they stole from. </p>
<p id="dn26:14.1">And so, mendicants, from not paying money to the penniless, poverty became widespread. When poverty was widespread, theft became widespread. When theft was widespread, swords became widespread. When swords were widespread, killing living creatures became widespread. And for the sentient beings among whom killing was widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined. Those people lived for 80,000 years, but their children lived for 40,000 years. </p>
<p id="dn26:14.3">Among the people who lived for 40,000 years, a certain person stole something from others. They arrested him and presented him to the king, saying, ‘Your Majesty, this person stole from others.’ </p>
<p id="dn26:14.7">The king said to that person, ‘Is it really true, mister, that you stole from others?’ </p>
<p id="dn26:14.9">‘No, sire,’ he said, deliberately lying. </p>
<p id="dn26:15.1">And so, mendicants, from not paying money to the penniless, poverty, theft, swords, and killing became widespread. When killing was widespread, lying became widespread. And for the sentient beings among whom lying was widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined. Those people who lived for 40,000 years had children who lived for 20,000 years. </p>
<p id="dn26:15.3">Among the people who lived for 20,000 years, a certain person stole something from others. Someone else reported this to the king, ‘Your Majesty, such-and-such person stole from others,’ he said, going behind his back. </p>
<p id="dn26:16.1">And so, mendicants, from not paying money to the penniless, poverty, theft, swords, killing, and lying became widespread. When lying was widespread, backbiting became widespread. And for the sentient beings among whom backbiting was widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined. Those people who lived for 20,000 years had children who lived for 10,000 years. </p>
<p id="dn26:17.1">Among the people who lived for 10,000 years, some were more beautiful than others. And the ugly beings, coveting the beautiful ones, committed adultery with others’ wives. </p>
<p id="dn26:17.3">And so, mendicants, from not paying money to the penniless, poverty, theft, swords, killing, lying, and backbiting became widespread. When backbiting was widespread, sexual misconduct became widespread. And for the sentient beings among whom sexual misconduct was widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined. Those people who lived for 10,000 years had children who lived for 5,000 years. </p>
<p id="dn26:17.5">Among the people who lived for 5,000 years, two things became widespread: harsh speech and talking nonsense. For the sentient beings among whom these two things were widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined. Those people who lived for 5,000 years had some children who lived for 2,500 years, while others lived for 2,000 years. </p>
<p id="dn26:17.9">Among the people who lived for 2,500 years, desire and ill will became widespread. For the sentient beings among whom desire and ill will were widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined. Those people who lived for 2,500 years had children who lived for 1,000 years. </p>
<p id="dn26:17.12">Among the people who lived for 1,000 years, wrong view became widespread. For the sentient beings among whom wrong view was widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined. Those people who lived for 1,000 years had children who lived for five hundred years. </p>
<p id="dn26:17.15">Among the people who lived for five hundred years, three things became widespread: illicit desire, immoral greed, and wrong thoughts. For the sentient beings among whom these three things were widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined. Those people who lived for five hundred years had some children who lived for two hundred and fifty years, while others lived for two hundred years. </p>
<p id="dn26:17.19">Among the people who lived for two hundred and fifty years, three things became widespread: lack of due respect for mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, and failure to honor the elders in the family. </p>
<p id="dn26:18.1">And so, mendicants, from not paying money to the penniless, all these things became widespread—poverty, theft, swords, killing, lying, backbiting, sexual misconduct, harsh speech and talking nonsense, desire and ill will, wrong view, illicit desire, immoral greed, and wrong thoughts, and lack of due respect for mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, and failure to honor the elders in the family. For the sentient beings among whom these things were widespread, their lifespan and beauty declined. Those people who lived for two hundred and fifty years had children who lived for a hundred years. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">5. When People Live for Ten Years </h3>
<p id="dn26:19.1">There will come a time, mendicants, when these people will have children who live for ten years. Among the people who live for ten years, girls will be marriageable at five. The following flavors will disappear: ghee, butter, oil, honey, molasses, and salt. The best kind of food will be finger millet, just as fine rice with meat is the best kind of food today. </p>
<p id="dn26:19.8">The ten ways of doing skillful deeds will totally disappear, and the ten ways of doing unskillful deeds will explode in popularity. Those people will not even have the word ‘skillful’, still less anyone who does what is skillful. And anyone who disrespects mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, and fails to honor the elders in the family will be venerated and praised, just as the opposite is venerated and praised today. </p>
<p id="dn26:20.1">There’ll be no recognition of the status of mother, aunts, or wives and partners of teachers and respected people. The world will become promiscuous, like goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and dogs and jackals. </p>
<p id="dn26:20.3">They’ll be full of hostility towards each other, with acute ill will, malevolence, and thoughts of murder. Even a mother will feel like this for her child, and the child for its mother, father for child, child for father, brother for sister, and sister for brother. They’ll be just like a deer hunter when he sees a deer—full of hostility, ill will, malevolence, and thoughts of killing. </p>
<p id="dn26:21.1">Among the people who live for ten years, there will be an interregnum of swords lasting seven days. During that time they will see each other as beasts. Sharp swords will appear in their hands, with which they’ll take each other’s life, crying, ‘It’s a beast! It’s a beast!’ </p>
<p id="dn26:21.5">But then some of those beings will think, ‘Let us neither be perpetrators nor victims! Why don’t we hide in thick grass, thick jungle, thick trees, inaccessible riverlands, or rugged mountains and survive on forest roots and fruits?’ So that’s what they do. </p>
<p id="dn26:21.8">When those seven days have passed, having emerged from their hiding places and embraced each other, they will come together in one voice and cry, ‘How fantastic, dear being, you live! How fantastic, dear being, you live!’ </p>
<h3 class="subheading">6. The Period of Growth </h3>
<p id="dn26:21.11">Then those beings will think, ‘It’s because we undertook unskillful things that we suffered such an extensive loss of our relatives. We’d better do what’s skillful. What skillful thing should we do? Why don’t we refrain from killing living creatures? Having undertaken this skillful thing we’ll live by it.’ So that’s what they do. Because of undertaking this skillful thing, their lifespan and beauty will grow. Those people who live for ten years will have children who live for twenty years. </p>
<p id="dn26:22.1">Then those beings will think, ‘Because of undertaking this skillful thing, our lifespan and beauty are growing. Why don’t we do even more skillful things? What skillful thing should we do? Why don’t we refrain from stealing … sexual misconduct … lying … backbiting … harsh speech … and talking nonsense. Why don’t we give up covetousness … ill will … wrong view … three things: illicit desire, immoral greed, and wrong thoughts. Why don’t we pay due respect to mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, honoring the elders in our families? Having undertaken this skillful thing we’ll live by it.’ So that’s what they do. </p>
<p id="dn26:22.18">Because of undertaking this skillful thing, their lifespan and beauty will grow. Those people who live for twenty years will have children who live for forty years. Those people who live for forty years will have children who live for eighty years, then a hundred and sixty years, three hundred and twenty years, six hundred and forty years, 2,000 years, 4,000 years, 8,000 years, 20,000 years, 40,000 years, and finally 80,000 years. Among the people who live for 80,000 years, girls will be marriageable at five hundred. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">7. The Time of King Saṅkha </h3>
<p id="dn26:23.5">Among the people who live for 80,000 years, there will be just three afflictions: greed, starvation, and old age. India will be successful and prosperous. The villages, towns, and capital cities will be no more than a chicken’s flight apart. And the land will be as crowded as hell, just full of people, like a thicket of rushes or reeds. The royal capital will be our Benares, but renamed Ketumati. And it will be successful, prosperous, populous, full of people, with plenty of food. There will be 84,000 cities in India, with the royal capital of Ketumati foremost. </p>
<p id="dn26:24.1">And in the royal capital of Ketumati a king named Saṅkha will arise, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion will extend to all four sides, he will achieve stability in the country, and possess the seven treasures. He will have the following seven treasures: the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure. He will have over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. After conquering this land girt by sea, he will reign by principle, without rod or sword. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">8. The Arising of the Buddha Metteyya </h3>
<p id="dn26:25.1">And the Blessed One named Metteyya will arise in the world—perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed—just as I have arisen today. He will realize with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and make it known to others, just as I do today. He will teach the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he will reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure, just as I do today. He will look after a Saṅgha of many thousand mendicants, just as I look after a Saṅgha of many hundreds today. </p>
<p id="dn26:26.1">Then King Saṅkha will have the sacrificial post that had been built by King Mahāpanāda raised up. After staying there, he will give it away to ascetics and brahmins, paupers, vagrants, nomads, and beggars. Then, having shaved off his hair and beard and dressed in ocher robes, he will go forth from the lay life to homelessness in the Buddha Metteyya’s presence. Soon after going forth, living withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, he will realize the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He will live having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="dn26:27.1">Mendicants, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge. And how does a mendicant do this? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. That’s how a mendicant lives as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how they let the teaching be their island and their refuge, with no other refuge. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">9. On Long Life and Beauty for Mendicants </h3>
<p id="dn26:28.1">Mendicants, you should roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers. Doing so, you will grow in life span, beauty, happiness, wealth, and power. </p>
<p id="dn26:28.3">And what is long life for a mendicant? It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort. They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy, and active effort. They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to mental development, and active effort. They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to inquiry, and active effort. Having developed and cultivated these four bases of psychic power they may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon. This is long life for a mendicant. </p>
<p id="dn26:28.10">And what is beauty for a mendicant? It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. This is beauty for a mendicant. </p>
<p id="dn26:28.13">And what is happiness for a mendicant? It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. This is happiness for a mendicant. </p>
<p id="dn26:28.19">And what is wealth for a mendicant? It’s when a monk meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion … rejoicing … equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. This is wealth for a mendicant. </p>
<p id="dn26:28.25">And what is power for a mendicant? It’s when a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. This is power for a mendicant. </p>
<p id="dn26:28.28">Mendicants, I do not see a single power so hard to defeat as the power of Māra. It is due to undertaking skillful qualities that this merit grows.” </p>
<p id="dn26:28.30">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. </p>
</article>
<article id="dn27">
<h2 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">DN 27</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">What Came First </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Aggaññasutta</span></h2>
<p id="dn27:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, in the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. </p>
<p id="dn27:1.3">Now at that time Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were living on probation among the mendicants in hopes of being ordained. Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came downstairs from the longhouse and was walking mindfully in the open air, beneath the shade of the longhouse. </p>
<p id="dn27:2.1">Vāseṭṭha saw him and said to Bhāradvāja, “Reverend Bhāradvāja, the Buddha is walking mindfully in the open air, beneath the shade of the longhouse. Come, reverend, let’s go to the Buddha. Hopefully we’ll get to hear a Dhamma talk from him.” </p>
<p id="dn27:2.6">“Yes, reverend,” replied Bhāradvāja. </p>
<p id="dn27:2.7">So they went to the Buddha, bowed, and walked beside him. </p>
<p id="dn27:3.1">Then the Buddha said to Vāseṭṭha, “Vāseṭṭha, you are both brahmins by birth and clan, and have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness from a brahmin family. I hope you don’t have to suffer abuse and insults from the brahmins.” </p>
<p id="dn27:3.3">“Actually, sir, the brahmins do insult and abuse us with their typical insults to the fullest extent.” </p>
<p id="dn27:3.4">“But how do the brahmins insult you?” </p>
<p id="dn27:3.5">“Sir, the brahmins say: ‘Only brahmins are the first caste; other castes are inferior. Only brahmins are the light caste; other castes are dark. Only brahmins are purified, not others. Only brahmins are Brahmā’s rightful sons, born of his mouth, born of Brahmā, created by Brahmā, heirs of Brahmā. You’ve both abandoned the first caste to join an inferior caste, namely these shavelings, fake ascetics, riffraff, black spawn from the feet of our kinsman. This is not right, it’s not proper!’ That’s how the brahmins insult us.” </p>
<p id="dn27:4.1">“Actually, Vāseṭṭha, the brahmins are forgetting their tradition when they say this to you. For brahmin women are seen menstruating, being pregnant, giving birth, and breast-feeding. Yet even though they’re born from a brahmin womb they say: ‘Only brahmins are the first caste; other castes are inferior. Only brahmins are the light caste; other castes are dark. Only brahmins are purified, not others. Only brahmins are Brahmā’s rightful sons, born of his mouth, born of Brahmā, created by Brahmā, heirs of Brahmā.’ They misrepresent the brahmins, speak falsely, and make much bad karma. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">1. Purification in the Four Castes </h3>
<p id="dn27:5.1">Vāseṭṭha, there are these four castes: aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers. Some aristocrats kill living creatures, steal, and commit sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, and nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, with wrong view. These things are unskillful, blameworthy, not to be cultivated, unworthy of the noble ones—and are reckoned as such. They are dark deeds with dark results, criticized by sensible people. Such things are seen in some aristocrats. And they are also seen among some brahmins, merchants, and workers. </p>
<p id="dn27:6.1">But some aristocrats refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, and committing sexual misconduct. They refrain from speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, and nonsensical. And they’re content, kind-hearted, with right view. These things are skillful, blameless, to be cultivated, worthy of the noble ones—and are reckoned as such. They are bright deeds with bright results, praised by sensible people. Such things are seen in some aristocrats. And they are also seen among some brahmins, merchants, and workers. </p>
<p id="dn27:7.1">Both these things occur like this, mixed up in these four castes—the dark and the bright, that which is praised and that which is criticized by sensible people. Yet of this the brahmins say: ‘Only brahmins are the first caste; other castes are inferior. Only brahmins are the light caste; other castes are dark. Only brahmins are purified, not others. Only brahmins are Brahmā’s rightful sons, born of his mouth, born of Brahmā, created by Brahmā, heirs of Brahmā.’ </p>
<p id="dn27:7.6">Sensible people don’t acknowledge this. Why is that? Because any mendicant from these four castes who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—is said to be foremost by virtue of principle, not without principle. For principle, Vāseṭṭha, is the first thing for people in both this life and the next. </p>
<p id="dn27:7.10">And here’s a way to understand how this is so. </p>
<p id="dn27:8.1">King Pasenadi of Kosala knows that the ascetic Gotama has gone forth from the neighboring clan of the Sakyans. And the Sakyans are his vassals. The Sakyans show deference to King Pasenadi by bowing down, rising up, greeting him with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for him. Now, King Pasenadi shows the same kind of deference to the Realized One. But he doesn’t think: ‘The ascetic Gotama is well-born, I am ill-born. He is powerful, I am weak. He is handsome, I am ugly. He is influential, I am insignificant.’ Rather, in showing such deference to the Realized One he is only honoring, respecting, and venerating principle. And here’s another way to understand how principle is the first thing for people in both this life and the next. </p>
<p id="dn27:9.1">Vāseṭṭha, you have different births, names, and clans, and have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness from different families. When they ask you what you are, you claim to be ascetics, followers of the Sakyan. But only when someone has faith in the Realized One—settled, rooted, and planted deep, strong, not to be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world—is it appropriate for them to say: ‘I am the Buddha’s true-born child, born from his mouth, born of principle, created by principle, heir to principle.’ Why is that? For these are terms for the Realized One: ‘the embodiment of truth’, and ‘the embodiment of holiness’, and ‘the one who has become the truth’, and ‘the one who has become holy’. </p>
<p id="dn27:10.1">There comes a time when, Vāseṭṭha, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos contracts. As the cosmos contracts, sentient beings are mostly headed for the realm of streaming radiance. There they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time. </p>
<p id="dn27:10.4">There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, this cosmos expands. As the cosmos expands, sentient beings mostly pass away from that host of radiant deities and come back to this realm. Here they are mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and they remain like that for a very long time. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. Solid Nectar Appears </h3>
<p id="dn27:11.1">But the single mass of water at that time was utterly dark. The moon and sun were not found, nor were stars and constellations, day and night, months and fortnights, years and seasons, or male and female. Beings were simply known as ‘beings’. After a very long period had passed, solid nectar curdled in the water. It appeared just like the curd on top of hot milk-rice as it cools. It was beautiful, fragrant, and delicious, like ghee or butter. And it was as sweet as pure manuka honey. Now, one of those beings was reckless. Thinking, ‘Oh my, what might this be?’ they tasted the solid nectar with their finger. They enjoyed it, and craving was born in them. And other beings, following that being’s example, tasted solid nectar with their fingers. They too enjoyed it, and craving was born in them. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">3. The Moon and Sun Appear </h3>
<p id="dn27:12.1">Then those beings started to eat the solid nectar, breaking it into lumps. But when they did this their luminosity vanished. And with the vanishing of their luminosity the moon and sun appeared, stars and constellations appeared, days and nights were distinguished, and so were months and fortnights, and years and seasons. To this extent the world had evolved once more. </p>
<p id="dn27:13.1">Then those beings eating the solid nectar, with that as their food and nourishment, remained for a very long time. But so long as they ate that solid nectar, their bodies became more solid and they diverged in appearance; some beautiful, some ugly. And the beautiful beings looked down on the ugly ones: ‘We’re more beautiful, they’re the ugly ones!’ And the vanity of the beautiful ones made the solid nectar vanish. They gathered together and bemoaned, ‘Oh, what a taste! Oh, what a taste!’ And even today when people get something tasty they say: ‘Oh, what a taste! Oh, what a taste!’ They’re just remembering an ancient primordial saying, but they don’t understand what it means. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">4. Ground-Sprouts </h3>
<p id="dn27:14.1">When the solid nectar had vanished, ground-sprouts appeared to those beings. They appeared just like mushrooms. They were beautiful, fragrant, and delicious, like ghee or butter. And they were as sweet as pure manuka honey. </p>
<p id="dn27:14.5">Then those beings started to eat the ground-sprouts. With that as their food and nourishment, they remained for a very long time. But so long as they ate those ground-sprouts, their bodies became more solid and they diverged in appearance; some beautiful, some ugly. And the beautiful beings looked down on the ugly ones: ‘We’re more beautiful, they’re the ugly ones!’ And the vanity of the beautiful ones made the ground-sprouts vanish. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">5. Bursting Pods </h3>
<p id="dn27:14.13">When the ground-sprouts had vanished, bursting pods appeared, like the fruit of the kadam tree. They were beautiful, fragrant, and delicious, like ghee or butter. And they were as sweet as pure manuka honey. </p>
<p id="dn27:15.1">Then those beings started to eat the bursting pods. With that as their food and nourishment, they remained for a very long time. But so long as they ate those bursting pods, their bodies became more solid and they diverged in appearance; some beautiful, some ugly. And the beautiful beings looked down on the ugly ones: ‘We’re more beautiful, they’re the ugly ones!’ And the vanity of the beautiful ones made the bursting pods vanish. </p>
<p id="dn27:15.8">They gathered together and bemoaned, ‘Oh, what we’ve lost! Oh, what we’ve lost—those bursting pods!’ And even today when people experience suffering they say: ‘Oh, what we’ve lost! Oh, what we’ve lost!’ They’re just remembering an ancient primordial saying, but they don’t understand what it means. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">6. Ripe Untilled Rice </h3>
<p id="dn27:16.1">When the bursting pods had vanished, ripe untilled rice appeared to those beings. It had no powder or husk, pure and fragrant, with only the rice-grain. What they took for supper in the evening, by the morning had grown back and ripened. And what they took for breakfast in the morning had grown back and ripened by the evening, so the cutting didn’t show. Then those beings eating the ripe untilled rice, with that as their food and nourishment, remained for a very long time. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">7. Gender Appears </h3>
<p id="dn27:16.7">But so long as they ate that ripe untilled rice, their bodies became more solid and they diverged in appearance. And female characteristics appeared on women, while male characteristics appeared on men. Women spent too much time gazing at men, and men at women. They became lustful, and their bodies burned with fever. Due to this fever they had sex with each other. </p>
<p id="dn27:16.11">Those who saw them having sex pelted them with dirt, ashes, or cow-dung, saying, ‘Get lost, filth! Get lost, filth! How on earth can one being do that to another?’ And even today people in some countries, when a bride is carried off, pelt her with dirt, ashes, or cow-dung. They’re just remembering an ancient primordial saying, but they don’t understand what it means. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">8. Sexual Intercourse </h3>
<p id="dn27:17.1">What was reckoned as immoral at that time, these days is reckoned as moral. The beings who had sex together weren’t allowed to enter a village or town for one or two months. Ever since they excessively threw themselves into immorality, they started to make buildings to hide their immoral deeds. Then one of those beings of idle disposition thought, ‘Hey now, why should I be bothered to gather rice in the evening for supper, and in the morning for breakfast? Why don’t I gather rice for supper and breakfast all at once?’ </p>
<p id="dn27:17.8">So that’s what he did. Then one of the other beings approached that being and said, ‘Come, good being, we shall go to gather rice.’ ‘There’s no need, good being! I gathered rice for supper and breakfast all at once.’ So that being, following their example, gathered rice for two days all at once, thinking: ‘This seems fine.’ </p>
<p id="dn27:17.13">Then one of the other beings approached that being and said, ‘Come, good being, we shall go to gather rice.’ ‘There’s no need, good being! I gathered rice for two days all at once.’ So that being, following their example, gathered rice for four days all at once, thinking: ‘This seems fine.’ </p>
<p id="dn27:17.17">Then one of the other beings approached that being and said, ‘Come, good being, we shall go to gather rice.’ ‘There’s no need, good being! I gathered rice for four days all at once.’ So that being, following their example, gathered rice for eight days all at once, thinking: ‘This seems fine.’ </p>
<p id="dn27:17.21">But when they started to store up rice to eat, the rice grains became wrapped in powder and husk, it didn’t grow back after reaping, the cutting showed, and the rice stood in clumps. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">9. Dividing the Fields </h3>
<p id="dn27:18.1">Then those beings gathered together and bemoaned, ‘Oh, how wicked things have appeared among beings! For we used to be mind-made, feeding on rapture, self-luminous, moving through the sky, steadily glorious, and we remained like that for a very long time. After a very long period had passed, solid nectar curdled in the water. But due to bad, unskillful things among us, the savory nectar vanished, the ground-sprouts vanished, the bursting pods vanished, and now the rice grains have become wrapped in powder and husk, it doesn’t grow back after reaping, the cutting shows, and the rice stands in clumps. We’d better divide up the rice and set boundaries.’ So that’s what they did. </p>
<p id="dn27:19.1">Now, one of those beings was reckless. While guarding their own share they took another’s share without it being given, and ate it. </p>
<p id="dn27:19.2">They grabbed the one who had done this and said, ‘You have done a bad thing, good being, in that while guarding your own share you took another’s share without it being given, and ate it. Do not do such a thing again.’ </p>
<p id="dn27:19.5">‘Yes, sirs,’ replied that being. But for a second time, and a third time they did the same thing, and were told not to continue. And then they struck that being, some with fists, others with stones, and still others with rods. From that day on stealing was found, and blaming and lying and the taking up of rods. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">10. The Elected King </h3>
<p id="dn27:20.1">Then those beings gathered together and bemoaned, ‘Oh, how wicked things have appeared among beings, in that stealing is found, and blaming and lying and the taking up of rods! Why don’t we elect one being who would rightly accuse those who deserve it, blame those who deserve it, and expel those who deserve it? We shall pay them with a share of rice.’ </p>
<p id="dn27:20.5">Then those beings approached the being among them who was most attractive, good-looking, lovely, and illustrious, and said, ‘Come, good being, rightly accuse those who deserve it, blame those who deserve it, and banish those who deserve it. We shall pay you with a share of rice.’ ‘Yes, sirs,’ replied that being. They acted accordingly, and were paid with a share of rice. </p>
<p id="dn27:21.1">‘Elected by the people’, Vāseṭṭha, is the meaning of ‘elected one’, the first term to be specifically invented for them. </p>
<p id="dn27:21.2">‘Lord of the fields’ is the meaning of ‘aristocrat’, the second term to be specifically invented. </p>
<p id="dn27:21.3">‘They please others with principle’ is the meaning of ‘king’, the third term to be specifically invented. </p>
<p id="dn27:21.4">And that, Vāseṭṭha, is how the ancient primordial terms for the circle of aristocrats were created; for those very beings, not others; for those like them, not unlike; legitimately, not illegitimately. For principle, Vāseṭṭha, is the first thing for people in both this life and the next. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">11. The Circle of Brahmins </h3>
<p id="dn27:22.1">Then some of those same beings thought, ‘Oh, how wicked things have appeared among beings, in that stealing is found, and blaming and lying and the taking up of rods and banishment! Why don’t we set aside bad, unskillful things?’ So that’s what they did. </p>
<p id="dn27:22.5">‘They set aside bad, unskillful things’ is the meaning of ‘brahmin’, the first term to be specifically invented for them. </p>
<p id="dn27:22.6">They built leaf huts in a wilderness region where they meditated pure and bright, without lighting cooking fires or digging the soil. They came down in the morning for breakfast and in the evening for supper to the village, town, or royal capital seeking a meal. When they had obtained food they continued to meditate in the leaf huts. </p>
<p id="dn27:22.8">When people noticed this they said, ‘These beings build leaf huts in a wilderness region where they meditate pure and bright, without lighting cooking fires or digging the soil. They come down in the morning for breakfast and in the evening for supper to the village, town, or royal capital seeking a meal. When they have obtained food they continue to meditate in the leaf huts.’ </p>
<p id="dn27:22.11">‘They meditate’ is the meaning of ‘meditator’, the second term to be specifically invented for them. </p>
<p id="dn27:23.1">But some of those beings were unable to keep up with their meditation in the leaf huts in the wilderness. They came down to the neighborhood of a village or town where they dwelt compiling texts. </p>
<p id="dn27:23.2">When people noticed this they said, ‘These beings were unable to keep up with their meditation in the leaf huts in the wilderness. They came down to the neighborhood of a village or town where they dwelt compiling texts. Now they don’t meditate.’ </p>
<p id="dn27:23.4">‘Now they don’t meditate’ is the meaning of ‘reciter’, the third term to be specifically invented for them. What was reckoned as lesser at that time, these days is reckoned as primary. </p>
<p id="dn27:23.6">And that, Vāseṭṭha, is how the ancient primordial terms for the circle of brahmins were created; for those very beings, not others; for those like them, not unlike; legitimately, not illegitimately. For principle, Vāseṭṭha, is the first thing for people in both this life and the next. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">12. The Circle of Merchants </h3>
<p id="dn27:24.1">Some of those same beings, taking up an active sex life, applied themselves to various jobs. </p>
<p id="dn27:24.2">‘Having taken up an active sex life, they apply themselves to various jobs’ is the meaning of ‘merchant’, the term specifically invented for them. </p>
<p id="dn27:24.3">And that, Vāseṭṭha, is how the ancient primordial term for the circle of merchants was created; for those very beings, not others; for those like them, not unlike; legitimately, not illegitimately. For principle, Vāseṭṭha, is the first thing for people in both this life and the next. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">13. The Circle of Workers </h3>
<p id="dn27:25.1">The remaining beings lived by hunting and menial tasks. </p>
<p id="dn27:25.2">‘They live by hunting and menial tasks’ is the meaning of ‘worker’, the term specifically invented for them. </p>
<p id="dn27:25.3">And that, Vāseṭṭha, is how the ancient primordial term for the circle of workers was created; for those very beings, not others; for those like them, not unlike; legitimately, not illegitimately. For principle, Vāseṭṭha, is the first thing for people in both this life and the next. </p>
<p id="dn27:26.1">There came a time when an aristocrat, brahmin, merchant, or worker, deprecating their own vocation, went forth from the lay life to homelessness, thinking, ‘I will be an ascetic.’ </p>
<p id="dn27:26.7">And that, Vāseṭṭha, is how these four circles were created; for those very beings, not others; for those like them, not unlike; legitimately, not illegitimately. For principle, Vāseṭṭha, is the first thing for people in both this life and the next. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">14. On Bad Conduct </h3>
<p id="dn27:27.1">An aristocrat, brahmin, merchant, worker, or ascetic may do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They have wrong view, and they act out of that wrong view. And because of that, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. </p>
<p id="dn27:28.1">An aristocrat, brahmin, merchant, worker, or ascetic may do good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They have right view, and they act out of that right view. And because of that, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. </p>
<p id="dn27:29.1">An aristocrat, brahmin, merchant, worker, or ascetic may do mixed things by way of body, speech, and mind. They have mixed view, and they act out of that mixed view. And because of that, when their body breaks up, after death, they experience both pleasure and pain. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">15. The Qualities That Lead to Awakening </h3>
<p id="dn27:30.1">An aristocrat, brahmin, merchant, worker, or ascetic who is restrained in body, speech, and mind, and develops the seven qualities that lead to awakening, becomes extinguished in this very life. </p>
<p id="dn27:31.1">Any mendicant from these four castes who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—is said to be the foremost by virtue of principle, not without principle. For principle, Vāseṭṭha, is the first thing for people in both this life and the next. </p>
<p id="dn27:32.1">Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra also spoke this verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn27:32.2">‘The aristocrat is first among people <br/>who take clan as the standard. <br/>But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct <br/>is first among gods and humans.’ </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn27:32.6">That verse was well sung by Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra, not poorly sung; well spoken, not poorly spoken; beneficial, not harmful, and I agree with it. I also say: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn27:32.8">The aristocrat is first among people <br/>who take clan as the standard. <br/>But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct <br/>is first among gods and humans.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn27:32.12">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were happy with what the Buddha said. </p>

<h3 class="subheading">1. Sāriputta’s Lion’s Roar </h3>
<p id="dn28:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Nālandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove. Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="dn28:1.4">“Sir, I have such confidence in the Buddha that I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.” </p>
<p id="dn28:1.5">“That’s a grand and dramatic statement, Sāriputta. You’ve roared a definitive, categorical lion’s roar, saying: ‘I have such confidence in the Buddha that I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.’ </p>
<p id="dn28:1.8">What about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past? Have you comprehended their minds to know that those Buddhas had such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?” </p>
<p id="dn28:1.10">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn28:1.11">“And what about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future? Have you comprehended their minds to know that those Buddhas will have such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?” </p>
<p id="dn28:1.13">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn28:1.14">“And what about me, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present? Have you comprehended my mind to know that I have such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?” </p>
<p id="dn28:1.16">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="dn28:1.17">“Well then, Sāriputta, given that you don’t comprehend the minds of Buddhas past, future, or present, what exactly are you doing, making such a grand and dramatic statement, roaring such a definitive, categorical lion’s roar?” </p>
<p id="dn28:2.1">“Sir, though I don’t comprehend the minds of Buddhas past, future, and present, still I understand this by inference from the teaching. Suppose there were a king’s frontier citadel with fortified embankments, ramparts, and arches, and a single gate. And it has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and clever. He keeps strangers out and lets known people in. As he walks around the patrol path, he doesn’t see a hole or cleft in the wall, not even one big enough for a cat to slip out. They’d think, ‘Whatever sizable creatures enter or leave the citadel, all of them do so via this gate.’ </p>
<p id="dn28:2.8">In the same way, I understand this by inference from the teaching: ‘All the perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas—whether past, future, or present—give up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Their mind is firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They correctly develop the seven awakening factors. And they wake up to the supreme perfect awakening.’ </p>
<p id="dn28:2.12">Sir, once I approached the Buddha to listen to the teaching. He explained Dhamma with its higher and higher stages, with its better and better stages, with its dark and bright sides. When I directly knew a certain principle of those teachings, in accordance with how I was taught, I came to a conclusion about the teachings. I had confidence in the Teacher: ‘The Blessed One is a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained. The Saṅgha is practicing well.’ </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.1. Teaching Skillful Qualities </h4>
<p id="dn28:3.1">And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches skillful qualities is unsurpassable. This consists of such skillful qualities as the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path. By these a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. This is unsurpassable when it comes to skillful qualities. The Buddha understands this without exception. There is nothing to be understood beyond this whereby another ascetic or brahmin might be superior in direct knowledge to the Buddha when it comes to skillful qualities. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.2. Describing the Sense Fields </h4>
<p id="dn28:4.1">And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the description of the sense fields is unsurpassable. There are these six interior and exterior sense fields. The eye and sights, the ear and sounds, the nose and smells, the tongue and tastes, the body and touches, and the mind and thoughts. This is unsurpassable when it comes to describing the sense fields. The Buddha understands this without exception. There is nothing to be understood beyond this whereby another ascetic or brahmin might be superior in direct knowledge to the Buddha when it comes to describing the sense fields. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.3. The Conception of the Embryo </h4>
<p id="dn28:5.1">And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the conception of the embryo is unsurpassable. There are these four kinds of conception. </p>
<p id="dn28:5.3">Firstly, someone is unaware when conceived in their mother’s womb, unaware as they remain there, and unaware as they emerge. This is the first kind of conception. </p>
<p id="dn28:5.4">Furthermore, someone is aware when conceived in their mother’s womb, but unaware as they remain there, and unaware as they emerge. This is the second kind of conception. </p>
<p id="dn28:5.5">Furthermore, someone is aware when conceived in their mother’s womb, aware as they remain there, but unaware as they emerge. This is the third kind of conception. </p>
<p id="dn28:5.6">Furthermore, someone is aware when conceived in their mother’s womb, aware as they remain there, and aware as they emerge. This is the fourth kind of conception. </p>
<p id="dn28:5.7">This is unsurpassable when it comes to the conception of the embryo. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.4. Ways of Revealing </h4>
<p id="dn28:6.1">And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the different ways of revealing is unsurpassable. There are these four ways of revealing. </p>
<p id="dn28:6.3">Firstly, someone reveals by means of a sign, ‘This is what you’re thinking, such is your thought, and thus is your state of mind.’ And even if they reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise. This is the first way of revealing. </p>
<p id="dn28:6.7">Furthermore, someone reveals after hearing it from humans or non-humans or deities, ‘This is what you’re thinking, such is your thought, and thus is your state of mind.’ And even if they reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise. This is the second way of revealing. </p>
<p id="dn28:6.11">Furthermore, someone reveals by hearing the sound of thought spreading as someone thinks and considers, ‘This is what you’re thinking, such is your thought, and thus is your state of mind.’ And even if they reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise. This is the third way of revealing. </p>
<p id="dn28:6.15">Furthermore, someone comprehends the mind of a person who has attained the immersion that’s free of placing the mind and keeping it connected. They understand, ‘Judging by the way this person’s intentions are directed, immediately after this mind state, they’ll think this thought.’ And even if they reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise. This is the fourth way of revealing. </p>
<p id="dn28:6.19">This is unsurpassable when it comes to the ways of revealing. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.5. Attainments of Vision </h4>
<p id="dn28:7.1">And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the attainments of vision is unsurpassable. There are these four attainments of vision. </p>
<p id="dn28:7.3">Firstly, some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they examine their own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth. ‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’ This is the first attainment of vision. </p>
<p id="dn28:7.6">Furthermore, some ascetic or brahmin attains that and goes beyond it. They examine a person’s bones with skin, flesh, and blood. This is the second attainment of vision. </p>
<p id="dn28:7.10">Furthermore, some ascetic or brahmin attains that and goes beyond it. They understand a person’s stream of consciousness, unbroken on both sides, established in both this world and the next. This is the third attainment of vision. </p>
<p id="dn28:7.15">Furthermore, some ascetic or brahmin attains that and goes beyond it. They understand a person’s stream of consciousness, unbroken on both sides, not established in either this world or the next. This is the fourth attainment of vision. </p>
<p id="dn28:7.20">This is unsurpassable when it comes to attainments of vision. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.6. Descriptions of Individuals </h4>
<p id="dn28:8.1">And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the description of individuals is unsurpassable. There are these seven individuals. One freed both ways, one freed by wisdom, a personal witness, one attained to view, one freed by faith, a follower of the teachings, a follower by faith. This is unsurpassable when it comes to the description of individuals. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.7. Kinds of Striving </h4>
<p id="dn28:9.1">And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the kinds of striving is unsurpassable. There are these seven awakening factors: the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. This is unsurpassable when it comes to the kinds of striving. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.8. Ways of Practice </h4>
<p id="dn28:10.1">And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the ways of practice is unsurpassable. </p>
<ol id="dn28:10.2">
<li>Painful practice with slow insight, </li>
<li>painful practice with swift insight, </li>
<li>pleasant practice with slow insight, and </li>
<li>pleasant practice with swift insight. </li>
</ol>
<p id="dn28:10.6">Of these, the painful practice with slow insight is said to be inferior both ways: because it’s painful and because it’s slow. The painful practice with swift insight is said to be inferior because it’s painful. The pleasant practice with slow insight is said to be inferior because it’s slow. But the pleasant practice with swift insight is said to be superior both ways: because it’s pleasant and because it’s swift. </p>
<p id="dn28:10.10">This is unsurpassable when it comes to the ways of practice. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.9. Behavior in Speech </h4>
<p id="dn28:11.1">And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches behavior in speech is unsurpassable. It’s when someone doesn’t use speech that’s connected with lying, or divisive, or backbiting, or aggressively trying to win. They speak only wise counsel, valuable and timely. This is unsurpassable when it comes to behavior in speech. </p>
<p id="dn28:12.1">And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches a person’s ethical behavior is unsurpassable. It’s when someone is honest and faithful. They don’t use deceit, flattery, hinting, or belittling, and they don’t use material possessions to chase after other material possessions. They guard the sense doors and eat in moderation. They’re fair, dedicated to wakefulness, tireless, energetic, and meditative. They have good memory, eloquence, range, retention, and thoughtfulness. They’re not greedy for sensual pleasures. They are mindful and alert. This is unsurpassable when it comes to a person’s ethical behavior. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.10. Responsiveness to Instruction </h4>
<p id="dn28:13.1">And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the different degrees of responsiveness to instruction is unsurpassable. There are these four degrees of responsiveness to instruction. </p>
<p id="dn28:13.3">The Buddha knows by investigating inside another individual: ‘By practicing as instructed this individual will, with the ending of three fetters, become a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.’ The Buddha knows by investigating inside another individual: ‘By practicing as instructed this individual will, with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, become a once-returner. They will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.’ The Buddha knows by investigating inside another individual: ‘By practicing as instructed this individual will, with the ending of the five lower fetters, be reborn spontaneously. They will be extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.’ The Buddha knows by investigating inside another individual: ‘By practicing as instructed this individual will realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ </p>
<p id="dn28:13.11">This is unsurpassable when it comes to the different degrees of responsiveness to instruction. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.11. The Knowledge and Freedom of Others </h4>
<p id="dn28:14.1">And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the knowledge and freedom of other individuals is unsurpassable. The Buddha knows by investigating inside another individual: ‘With the ending of three fetters this individual will become a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.’ The Buddha knows by investigating inside another individual: ‘With the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, this individual will become a once-returner. They will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.’ The Buddha knows by investigating inside another individual: ‘With the ending of the five lower fetters, this individual will be reborn spontaneously. They will be extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world.’ The Buddha knows by investigating inside another individual: ‘This individual will realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ This is unsurpassable when it comes to the knowledge and freedom of other individuals. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.12. Eternalism </h4>
<p id="dn28:15.1">And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches eternalist doctrines is unsurpassable. There are these three eternalist doctrines. </p>
<p id="dn28:15.3">Firstly, some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect many hundreds of thousands of past lives, with features and details. They say, ‘I know that in the past the cosmos expanded or contracted. I don’t know whether in the future the cosmos will expand or contract. The self and the cosmos are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. They remain the same for all eternity, while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and rearise.’ This is the first eternalist doctrine. </p>
<p id="dn28:15.10">Furthermore, some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect their past lives for as many as ten eons of the expansion and contraction of the cosmos, with features and details. They say, ‘I know that in the past the cosmos expanded or contracted. I don’t know whether in the future the cosmos will expand or contract. The self and the cosmos are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. They remain the same for all eternity, while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and rearise.’ This is the second eternalist doctrine. </p>
<p id="dn28:15.18">Furthermore, some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect their past lives for as many as forty eons of the expansion and contraction of the cosmos, with features and details. They say, ‘I know that in the past the cosmos expanded or contracted. I don’t know whether in the future the cosmos will expand or contract. The self and the cosmos are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. They remain the same for all eternity, while these sentient beings wander and transmigrate and pass away and rearise.’ This is the third eternalist doctrine. </p>
<p id="dn28:15.26">This is unsurpassable when it comes to eternalist doctrines. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.13. Recollecting Past Lives </h4>
<p id="dn28:16.1">And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the knowledge of recollecting past lives is unsurpassable. It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they recollect their many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. Sir, there are gods whose life span cannot be reckoned or calculated. Still, no matter what incarnation they have previously been reborn in—whether physical or formless or percipient or non-percipient or neither percipient nor non-percipient—they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. This is unsurpassable when it comes to the knowledge of recollecting past lives. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.14. Death and Rebirth </h4>
<p id="dn28:17.1">And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches the knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings is unsurpassable. It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn— inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. This is unsurpassable when it comes to the knowledge of death and rebirth. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.15. Psychic Powers </h4>
<p id="dn28:18.1">And moreover, sir, how the Buddha teaches psychic power is unsurpassable. There are these two kinds of psychic power. There are psychic powers that are accompanied by defilements and attachments, and are said to be ignoble. And there are psychic powers that are free of defilements and attachments, and are said to be noble. What are the psychic powers that are accompanied by defilements and attachments, and are said to be ignoble? It’s when some ascetic or brahmin—by dint of keen, resolute, committed, and diligent effort, and right focus—experiences an immersion of the heart of such a kind that they wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm. These are the psychic powers that are accompanied by defilements and attachments, and are said to be ignoble. </p>
<p id="dn28:18.9">But what are the psychic powers that are free of defilements and attachments, and are said to be noble? It’s when, if a mendicant wishes: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive,’ that’s what they do. If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive,’ that’s what they do. If they wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. These are the psychic powers that are free of defilements and attachments, and are said to be noble. This is unsurpassable when it comes to psychic powers. The Buddha understands this without exception. There is nothing to be understood beyond this whereby another ascetic or brahmin might be superior in direct knowledge to the Buddha when it comes to psychic powers. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.16. The Four Absorptions </h4>
<p id="dn28:19.1">The Buddha has achieved what should be achieved by a faithful gentleman by being energetic and strong, by human strength, energy, vigor, and exertion. The Buddha doesn’t indulge in sensual pleasures, which are low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And he doesn’t indulge in self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless. He gets the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when he wants, without trouble or difficulty. </p>
<h4 class="subheading">1.17. On Being Questioned </h4>
<p id="dn28:19.5">Sir, if they were to ask me, ‘Reverend Sāriputta, is there any other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening?’ I would tell them ‘No.’ </p>
<p id="dn28:19.9">But if they were to ask me, ‘Reverend Sāriputta, is there any other ascetic or brahmin—whether past or future—whose direct knowledge is equal to the Buddha when it comes to awakening?’ I would tell them ‘Yes.’ But if they were to ask: ‘Reverend Sāriputta, is there any other ascetic or brahmin at present whose direct knowledge is equal to the Buddha when it comes to awakening?’ I would tell them ‘No.’ </p>
<p id="dn28:19.13">But if they were to ask me, ‘But why does Venerable Sāriputta grant this in respect of some but not others?’ I would answer them like this, ‘Reverends, I have heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha: “The perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas of the past and the future are equal to myself when it comes to awakening.” And I have also heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha: “It’s impossible for two perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas to arise in the same solar system at the same time.”’ </p>
<p id="dn28:19.21">Answering this way, I trust that I repeated what the Buddha has said, and didn’t misrepresent him with an untruth. I trust my explanation was in line with the teaching, and that there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism.” </p>
<p id="dn28:19.22">“Indeed, Sāriputta, in answering this way you repeat what I’ve said, and don’t misrepresent me with an untruth. Your explanation is in line with the teaching, and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. Incredible and Amazing </h3>
<p id="dn28:20.1">When he had spoken, Venerable Udāyī said to the Buddha, “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! The Realized One has so few wishes, such contentment, such self-effacement! For even though the Realized One has such power and might, he will not make a display of himself. If the wanderers following other paths were to see even a single one of these qualities in themselves they’d carry around a banner to that effect. It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! The Realized One has so few wishes, such contentment, such self-effacement! For even though the Realized One has such power and might, he will not make a display of himself.” </p>
<p id="dn28:20.7">“See, Udāyī, how the Realized One has so few wishes, such contentment, such self-effacement. For even though the Realized One has such power and might, he will not make a display of himself. If the wanderers following other paths were to see even a single one of these qualities in themselves they’d carry around a banner to that effect. See, Udāyī, how the Realized One has so few wishes, such contentment, such self-effacement. For even though the Realized One has such power and might, he will not make a display of himself.” </p>
<p id="dn28:21.1">Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta, “So Sāriputta, you should frequently speak this exposition of the teaching to the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. Though there will be some foolish people who have doubt or uncertainty regarding the Realized One, when they hear this exposition of the teaching they’ll give up that doubt or uncertainty.” </p>
<p id="dn28:21.4">That’s how Venerable Sāriputta declared his confidence in the Buddha’s presence. And that’s why the name of this discussion is “Inspiring Confidence”. </p>

<h2 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">DN 29</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">An Impressive Discourse </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Pāsādikasutta</span></h2>
<p id="dn29:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans in a stilt longhouse in a mango grove belonging to the Sakyan family named Vedhañña. </p>
<p id="dn29:1.3">Now at that time the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta had recently passed away at Pāvā. With his passing the Jain ascetics split, dividing into two factions, arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words: </p>
<p id="dn29:1.5">“You don’t understand this teaching and training. I understand this teaching and training. What, you understand this teaching and training? You’re practicing wrong. I’m practicing right. I stay on topic, you don’t. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!” </p>
<p id="dn29:1.6">You’d think there was nothing but slaughter going on among the Jain ascetics. And the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta’s white-clothed lay disciples were disillusioned, dismayed, and disappointed in the Jain ascetics. They were equally disappointed with a teaching and training so poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha, with broken monument and without a refuge. </p>
<p id="dn29:2.1">And then, after completing the rainy season residence near Pāvā, the novice Cunda went to see Venerable Ānanda at Sāma village. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. </p>
<p id="dn29:2.4">Ānanda said to him, “Reverend Cunda, we should see the Buddha about this matter. Come, let’s go to the Buddha and tell him about this.” </p>
<p id="dn29:2.7">“Yes, sir,” replied Cunda. </p>
<p id="dn29:3.1">Then Ānanda and Cunda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">1. The Teaching of the Unawakened </h3>
<p id="dn29:4.1">“That’s what happens, Cunda, when a teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha. </p>
<p id="dn29:4.2">Take the case where a teacher is not awakened, and the teaching is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha. A disciple in that teaching does not practice in line with the teachings, does not practice following that procedure, does not live in line with the teaching. They proceed having turned away from that teaching. You should say this to them, ‘You’re fortunate, reverend, you’re so very fortunate! For your teacher is not awakened, and their teaching is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha. But you don’t practice in line with that teaching, you don’t practice following that procedure, you don’t live in line with the teaching. You proceed having turned away from that teaching.’ In such a case the teacher and the teaching are to blame, but the disciple deserves praise. Suppose someone was to say to such a disciple, ‘Come on, venerable, practice as taught and pointed out by your teacher.’ The one who encourages, the one who they encourage, and the one who practices accordingly all make much bad karma. Why is that? It’s because that teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha. </p>
<p id="dn29:5.1">Take the case where a teacher is not awakened, and the teaching is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha. A disciple in that teaching practices in line with the teachings, practices following that procedure, lives in line with the teaching. They proceed having undertaken that teaching. You should say this to them, ‘It’s your loss, reverend, it’s your misfortune! For your teacher is not awakened, and their teaching is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha. And you practice in line with that teaching, you practice following that procedure, you live in line with the teaching. You proceed having undertaken that teaching.’ In such a case the teacher, the teaching, and the disciple are all to blame. Suppose someone was to say to such a disciple, ‘Clearly the venerable is practicing methodically and will succeed in completing that method.’ The one who praises, the one who they praise, and the one who, being praised, rouses up even more energy all make much bad karma. Why is that? It’s because that teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. The Teaching of the Awakened </h3>
<p id="dn29:6.1">Take the case where a teacher is awakened, and the teaching is well explained and well propounded, emancipating, leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is a fully awakened Buddha. A disciple in that teaching does not practice in line with the teachings, does not practice following that procedure, does not live in line with the teaching. They proceed having turned away from that teaching. You should say this to them, ‘It’s your loss, reverend, it’s your misfortune!

<h3 class="subheading">3. When Disciples Have Regrets </h3>
<p id="dn29:8.1">Take the case where a teacher arises in the world who is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha. The teaching is well explained and well propounded, emancipating, leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is fully awakened. But the disciples haven’t inquired about the meaning of that good teaching. And the spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure has not been disclosed and revealed to them with all its collected sayings, with its demonstrable basis, well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans. And then their teacher passes away. When such a teacher has passed away the disciples are tormented by regrets. Why is that? They think: ‘Our teacher was perfected, a fully awakened Buddha. His teaching was well explained, but we didn’t inquire about the meaning, and the spiritual practice was not fully disclosed to us. And then our teacher passed away.’ When such a teacher has passed away the disciples are tormented by regrets. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">4. When Disciples Have No Regrets </h3>

<h3 class="subheading">5. On the Incomplete Spiritual Path, Etc. </h3>
<p id="dn29:10.1">Now suppose, Cunda, that a spiritual path possesses those factors. But the teacher is not senior, long standing, long gone forth, advanced in years, and reached the final stage of life. Then that spiritual path is incomplete in that respect. </p>
<p id="dn29:10.3">But when a spiritual path possesses those factors and the teacher is senior, then that spiritual path is complete in that respect. </p>
<p id="dn29:11.1">Now suppose that a spiritual path possesses those factors and the teacher is senior. But there are no senior monk disciples who are competent, educated, assured, have attained sanctuary, who can rightly explain the true teaching, and who can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable basis. Then that spiritual path is incomplete in that respect. </p>
<p id="dn29:12.1">But when a spiritual path possesses those factors and the teacher is senior and there are competent senior monks, then that spiritual path is complete in that respect. </p>
<p id="dn29:12.4">Now suppose that a spiritual path possesses those factors and the teacher is senior and there are competent senior monks. But there are no competent middle monks, junior monks, senior nuns, middle nuns, junior nuns, celibate white-clothed laymen, white-clothed laymen enjoying sensual pleasures, celibate white-clothed laywomen, white-clothed laywomen enjoying sensual pleasures. … There are white-clothed laywomen enjoying sensual pleasures, but the spiritual path is not successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans … the spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans, but it has not reached the peak of material possessions and fame. Then that spiritual path is incomplete in that respect. </p>
<p id="dn29:13.1">But when a spiritual path possesses those factors and the teacher is senior and there are competent senior monks, middle monks, junior monks, senior nuns, middle nuns, junior nuns, celibate laymen, laymen enjoying sensual pleasures, celibate laywomen, laywomen enjoying sensual pleasures, and the spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans, and it has reached the peak of material possessions and fame, then that spiritual path is complete in that respect. </p>
<p id="dn29:14.1">I, Cunda, am a teacher who has arisen in the world today, perfected and fully awakened. The teaching is well explained and well propounded, emancipating, leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is fully awakened. My disciples have inquired about the meaning of that good teaching. And the spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure has been disclosed and revealed to them with all its collected sayings, with its demonstrable basis, well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans. I am a teacher today who is senior, long standing, long gone forth, advanced in years, and have reached the final stage of life. </p>
<p id="dn29:15.1">I have today disciples who are competent senior monks, middle monks, junior monks, senior nuns, middle nuns, junior nuns, celibate laymen, laymen enjoying sensual pleasures, celibate laywomen, and laywomen enjoying sensual pleasures. Today my spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans. </p>
<p id="dn29:16.1">Of all the teachers in the world today, Cunda, I don’t see even a single one who has reached the peak of material possessions and fame like me. Of all the spiritual communities and groups in the world today, Cunda, I don’t see even a single one who has reached the pinnacle of material possessions and fame like the mendicant Saṅgha. And if there’s any spiritual path of which it may be rightly said that it’s endowed with all good qualities, complete in all good qualities, neither too little nor too much, well explained, whole, full, and well propounded, it’s of this spiritual path that this should be said. </p>
<p id="dn29:16.8">Uddaka, son of Rāma, used to say: ‘Seeing, one does not see.’ But seeing what does one not see? You can see the blade of a well-sharpened razor, but not the edge. Thus it is said: ‘Seeing, one does not see.’ But that saying of Uddaka’s is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless, as it’s only concerning a razor. If there’s anything of which it may be rightly said: ‘Seeing, one does not see,’ it’s of this that it should be said. Seeing what does one not see? One sees this: a spiritual path endowed with all good qualities, complete in all good qualities, neither too little nor too much, well explained, whole, full, and well propounded. One does not see this: anything that, were it to be removed, would make it purer. One does not see this: anything that, were it to be added, would make it more complete. Thus it is rightly said: ‘Seeing, one does not see.’ </p>
<h3 class="subheading">6. Teachings Should be Recited in Concert </h3>
<p id="dn29:17.1">So, Cunda, you should all come together and recite in concert, without disputing, those things I have taught you from my direct knowledge, comparing meaning with meaning and phrasing with phrasing, so that this spiritual path may last for a long time. That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans. And what are those things I have taught from my direct knowledge? They are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path. These are the things I have taught from my own direct knowledge. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">7. Reaching Agreement </h3>
<p id="dn29:18.1">Suppose one of those spiritual companions who is training in harmony and mutual appreciation, without disputing, were to recite the teaching in the Saṅgha. Now, you might think, ‘This venerable misconstrues the meaning and mistakes the phrasing.’ You should neither approve nor dismiss them, but say, ‘Reverend, if this is the meaning, the phrasing may either be this or that: which is more fitting? And if this is the phrasing, the meaning may be either this or that: which is more fitting?’ Suppose they reply, ‘This phrasing fits the meaning better than that. And this meaning fits the phrasing better than that.’ Without flattering or rebuking them, you should carefully convince them by examining that meaning and that phrasing. </p>
<p id="dn29:19.1">Suppose another spiritual companion were to recite the teaching in the Saṅgha. Now, you might think, ‘This venerable misconstrues the meaning but gets the phrasing right.’ You should neither approve nor dismiss them, but say, ‘Reverend, if this is the phrasing, the meaning may be either this or that: which is more fitting?’ Suppose they reply, ‘This meaning fits the phrasing better than that.’ Without flattering or rebuking, you should carefully convince them by examining that meaning. </p>
<p id="dn29:20.1">Suppose another spiritual companion were to recite the teaching in the Saṅgha. Now, you might think, ‘This venerable construes the meaning correctly but mistakes the phrasing.’ You should neither approve nor dismiss them, but say, ‘Reverend, if this is the meaning, the phrasing may be either this or that: which is more fitting?’ Suppose they reply, ‘This phrasing fits the meaning better than that.’ Without flattering or rebuking, you should carefully convince them by examining that phrasing. </p>
<p id="dn29:21.1">Suppose another spiritual companion were to recite the teaching in the Saṅgha. Now, you might think, ‘This venerable construes the meaning correctly and gets the phrasing right.’ Saying ‘Good!’ you should applaud and cheer that mendicant’s statement, and then say to them, ‘We are fortunate, reverend, so very fortunate to see a venerable such as yourself, so well-versed in the meaning and the phrasing, as one of our spiritual companions!’ </p>
<h3 class="subheading">8. The Reasons for Allowing Requisites </h3>
<p id="dn29:22.1">Cunda, I do not teach you solely for restraining defilements that affect the present life. Nor do I teach solely for protecting against defilements that affect lives to come. I teach both for restraining defilements that affect the present life and protecting against defilements that affect lives to come. </p>
<p id="dn29:22.5">And that’s why I have allowed robes for you that suffice only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; and for covering up the private parts. I have allowed almsfood for you that suffices only to sustain this body, avoid harm, and support spiritual practice; so that you will put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and will keep on living blamelessly and at ease. I have allowed lodgings for you that suffice only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; to shelter from harsh weather and to enjoy retreat. I have allowed medicines and supplies for the sick for you that suffice only for the sake of warding off the pains of illness and to promote good health. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">9. Indulgence in Pleasure </h3>
<p id="dn29:23.1">It’s possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say, ‘The ascetics who follow the Sakyan live indulging in pleasure.’ You should say to them, ‘What is that indulgence in pleasure? For there are many different kinds of indulgence in pleasure.’ </p>
<p id="dn29:23.6">These four kinds of indulgence in pleasure, Cunda, are low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. What four? </p>
<p id="dn29:23.8">It’s when some fool makes themselves happy and pleased by killing living creatures. This is the first kind of indulgence in pleasure. </p>
<p id="dn29:23.10">Furthermore, someone makes themselves happy and pleased by theft. This is the second kind of indulgence in pleasure. </p>
<p id="dn29:23.12">Furthermore, someone makes themselves happy and pleased by lying. This is the third kind of indulgence in pleasure. </p>
<p id="dn29:23.14">Furthermore, someone amuses themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. This is the fourth kind of indulgence in pleasure. </p>
<p id="dn29:23.16">These are the four kinds of indulgence in pleasure that are low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. </p>
<p id="dn29:24.1">It’s possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say, ‘The ascetics who follow the Sakyan live indulging in pleasure in these four ways.’ They should be told, ‘Not so!’ It isn’t right to say that about you; it misrepresents you with an untruth. </p>
<p id="dn29:24.5">These four kinds of indulgence in pleasure, when developed and cultivated, lead solely to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. What four? </p>
<p id="dn29:24.7">It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. This is the first kind of indulgence in pleasure. </p>
<p id="dn29:24.9">Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption. It has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. This is the second kind of indulgence in pleasure. </p>
<p id="dn29:24.11">Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption. They meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ This is the third kind of indulgence in pleasure. </p>
<p id="dn29:24.13">Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption. It is without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. This is the fourth kind of indulgence in pleasure. </p>
<p id="dn29:24.15">These are the four kinds of indulgence in pleasure which, when developed and cultivated, lead solely to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. </p>
<p id="dn29:24.16">It’s possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say, ‘The ascetics who follow the Sakyan live indulging in pleasure in these four ways.’ They should be told, ‘Exactly so!’ It’s right to say that about you; it doesn’t misrepresent you with an untruth. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">10. The Benefits of Indulgence in Pleasure </h3>
<p id="dn29:25.1">It’s possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say, ‘How many fruits and benefits may be expected by those who live indulging in pleasure in these four ways?’ You should say to them, ‘Four benefits may be expected by those who live indulging in pleasure in these four ways. What four? </p>
<p id="dn29:25.6">Firstly, with the ending of three fetters a mendicant becomes a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. This is the first fruit and benefit. </p>
<p id="dn29:25.8">Furthermore, a mendicant—with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion—becomes a once-returner. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. This is the second fruit and benefit. </p>
<p id="dn29:25.10">Furthermore, with the ending of the five lower fetters, a mendicant is reborn spontaneously and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. This is the third fruit and benefit. </p>
<p id="dn29:25.12">Furthermore, a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. This is the fourth fruit and benefit. </p>
<p id="dn29:25.14">These four benefits may be expected by those who live indulging in pleasure in these four ways.’ </p>
<h3 class="subheading">11. Things Impossible for the Perfected </h3>
<p id="dn29:26.1">It’s possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say, ‘The ascetics who follow the Sakyan are inconsistent.’ You should say to them, ‘Reverends, these things have been taught and pointed out for his disciples by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, not to be transgressed so long as life lasts. Suppose there was a boundary pillar or an iron pillar with deep foundations, firmly embedded, imperturbable and unshakable. In the same way, these things have been taught and pointed out for his disciples by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, not to be transgressed so long as life lasts. </p>
<p id="dn29:26.7">A mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—can’t transgress in nine respects. A mendicant with defilements ended can’t deliberately take the life of a living creature, take something with the intention to steal, have sex, tell a deliberate lie, or store up goods for their own enjoyment like they did as a lay person. And they can’t make decisions prejudiced by favoritism, hostility, stupidity, or cowardice. A mendicant who is perfected can’t transgress in these nine respects.’ </p>
<h3 class="subheading">12. Questions and Answers </h3>
<p id="dn29:27.1">It’s possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say, ‘The ascetic Gotama demonstrates boundless knowledge and vision of the past, but not of the future. What’s up with that?’ Those wanderers, like incompetent fools, seem to imagine that one kind of knowledge and vision can be demonstrated by means of another kind of knowledge and vision. </p>
<p id="dn29:27.4">Regarding the past, the Realized One has knowledge stemming from memory. He recollects as far as he wants. </p>
<p id="dn29:27.6">Regarding the future, the Realized One has the knowledge born of awakening: ‘This is my last rebirth. Now there are no more future lives.’ </p>
<p id="dn29:28.1">If a question about the past is untrue, false, and pointless, the Realized One does not reply. If a question about the past is true and substantive, but pointless, he does not reply. If a question about the past is true, substantive, and beneficial, he knows the right time to reply. And the Realized One replies to questions about the future or the present in the same way. </p>
<p id="dn29:28.8">And so the Realized One has speech that’s well-timed, true, meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’. </p>
<p id="dn29:29.1">In this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, and explored by the mind, all that has been understood by the Realized One. That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’. </p>
<p id="dn29:29.3">From the night when the Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening until the night he becomes fully extinguished—through the element of extinguishment with nothing left over—everything he speaks, says, and expresses is real, not otherwise. That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’. </p>
<p id="dn29:29.5">The Realized One does as he says, and says as he does. Since this is so, that’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’. In this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—the Realized One is the undefeated, the champion, the universal seer, the wielder of power. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">13. The Undeclared Points </h3>
<p id="dn29:30.1">It’s possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say, ‘Is this your view: “A Realized One exists after death. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly”?’ You should say to them, ‘Reverend, this has not been declared by the Buddha.’ </p>
<p id="dn29:30.6">The wanderers might say, ‘Then is this your view: “A Realized One doesn’t exist after death. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly”?’ You should say to them, ‘This too has not been declared by the Buddha.’ </p>
<p id="dn29:30.11">The wanderers might say, ‘Then is this your view: “A Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly”?’ You should say to them, ‘This too has not been declared by the Buddha.’ </p>
<p id="dn29:30.16">The wanderers might say, ‘Then is this your view: “A Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly”?’ You should say to them, ‘This too has not been declared by the Buddha.’ </p>
<p id="dn29:31.1">The wanderers might say, ‘But why has this not been declared by the ascetic Gotama?’ You should say to them, ‘Because it’s not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. That’s why it hasn’t been declared by the Buddha.’ </p>
<h3 class="subheading">14. The Declared Points </h3>
<p id="dn29:32.1">It’s possible that wanderers who follow other paths might say, ‘But what has been declared by the ascetic Gotama?’ You should say to them, ‘What has been declared by the Buddha is this: “This is suffering”—“This is the origin of suffering”—“This is the cessation of suffering”—“This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.”’ </p>
<p id="dn29:33.1">The wanderers might say, ‘But why has this been declared by the ascetic Gotama?’ You should say to them, ‘Because it’s beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. It leads to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. That’s why it has been declared by the Buddha.’ </p>
<h3 class="subheading">15. Views of the Past </h3>
<p id="dn29:34.1">Cunda, I have explained to you as they should be explained the views that some rely on regarding the past. Shall I explain them to you in the wrong way? I have explained to you as they should be explained the views that some rely on regarding the future. Shall I explain them to you in the wrong way? </p>
<p id="dn29:34.5">What are the views that some rely on regarding the past? There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘The self and the cosmos are eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.’ There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘The self and the cosmos are not eternal, or both eternal and not eternal, or neither eternal nor not eternal. The self and the cosmos are made by oneself, or made by another, or made by both oneself and another, or they have arisen by chance, not made by oneself or another. Pleasure and pain are eternal, or not eternal, or both eternal and not eternal, or neither eternal nor not eternal. Pleasure and pain are made by oneself, or made by another, or made by both oneself and another, or they have arisen by chance, not made by oneself or another. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.’ </p>
<p id="dn29:35.1">Regarding this, I go up to the ascetics and brahmins whose view is that the self and the cosmos are eternal, and say, ‘Reverends, is this what you say, “The self and the cosmos are eternal”?’ But when they say, ‘Yes! This is the only truth, other ideas are silly,’ I don’t acknowledge that. Why is that? Because there are beings who have different opinions on this topic. I don’t see any such expositions that are equal to my own, still less superior. Rather, I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher exposition. </p>
<p id="dn29:36.1">Regarding this, I go up to the ascetics and brahmins who assert all the other views as described above. And in each case, I don’t acknowledge that. Why is that? Because there are beings who have different opinions on this topic. I don’t see any such expositions that are equal to my own, still less superior. Rather, I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher exposition. </p>
<p id="dn29:36.27">These are the views that some rely on regarding the past. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">16. Views of the Future </h3>
<p id="dn29:37.1">What are the views that some rely on regarding the future? There are some ascetics and brahmins who have this doctrine and view: ‘The self is has form and is well after death, or it is formless, or both formed and formless, or neither formed nor formless, or percipient, or non-percipient, or neither percipient nor non-percipient, or the self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly.’ </p>
<p id="dn29:38.1">Regarding this, I go up to the ascetics and brahmins whose view is that The self is has form and is well after death, and say, ‘Reverends, is this what you say, “The self is has form and is well after death”?’ But when they say, ‘Yes! This is the only truth, other ideas are silly,’ I don’t acknowledge that. Why is that? Because there are beings who have different opinions on this topic. I don’t see any such expositions that are equal to my own, still less superior. Rather, I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher exposition. </p>
<p id="dn29:39.1">Regarding this, I go up to the ascetics and brahmins who assert all the other views as described above. And in each case, I don’t acknowledge that. Why is that? Because there are beings who have different opinions on this topic. I don’t see any such expositions that are equal to my own, still less superior. Rather, I am the one who is superior when it comes to the higher exposition. </p>
<p id="dn29:39.19">These are the views that some rely on regarding the future, which I have explained to you as they should be explained. Shall I explain them to you in the wrong way? </p>
<p id="dn29:40.1">I have taught and pointed out the four kinds of mindfulness meditation for giving up and going beyond all these views of the past and the future. What four? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. These are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation that I have taught for giving up and going beyond all these views of the past and the future.” </p>
<p id="dn29:41.1">Now at that time Venerable Upavāṇa was standing behind the Buddha fanning him. He said to the Buddha, “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! This exposition of the teaching is impressive, sir, it is very impressive. Sir, what is the name of this exposition of the teaching?” </p>
<p id="dn29:41.6">“Well, Upavāṇa, you may remember this exposition of the teaching as ‘The Impressive Discourse’.” </p>
<p id="dn29:41.7">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, Venerable Upavāṇa was happy with what the Buddha said. </p>

<p id="dn30:1.1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>
<p id="dn30:1.1.5">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="dn30:1.1.7">“There are thirty-two marks of a great man. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other. If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures. He has the following seven treasures: the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure. He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword. But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.1">And what are the thirty-two marks? </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.4">He has well-planted feet. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.5">On the soles of his feet there are thousand-spoked wheels, with rims and hubs, complete in every detail. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.6">He has projecting heels. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.7">He has long fingers. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.8">His hands and feet are tender. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.9">His hands and feet cling gracefully. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.10">His feet are arched. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.11">His calves are like those of an antelope. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.12">When standing upright and not bending over, the palms of both hands touch the knees. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.13">His private parts are covered in a foreskin. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.14">He is gold colored; his skin has a golden sheen. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.15">He has delicate skin, so delicate that dust and dirt don’t stick to his body. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.16">His hairs grow one per pore. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.17">His hairs stand up; they’re blue-black and curl clockwise. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.18">His body is tall and straight. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.19">He has bulging muscles in seven places. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.20">His chest is like that of a lion. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.21">The gap between the shoulder-blades is filled in. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.22">He has the proportional circumference of a banyan tree: the span of his arms equals the height of his body. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.23">His torso is cylindrical. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.24">He has an excellent sense of taste. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.25">His jaw is like that of a lion. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.26">He has forty teeth. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.27">His teeth are even. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.28">His teeth have no gaps. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.29">His teeth are perfectly white. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.30">He has a large tongue. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.31">He has the voice of Brahmā, like a cuckoo’s call. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.32">His eyes are deep blue. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.33">He has eyelashes like a cow’s. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.34">Between his eyebrows there grows a tuft, soft and white like cotton-wool. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.2.35">His head is shaped like a turban. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.3.1">These are the thirty-two marks of a great man. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.3.4">Seers who are outsiders remember these marks, but they do not know the specific deeds performed in the past to obtain each mark. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">1. Well-Planted Feet </h3>
<p id="dn30:1.4.1">In some past lives, past existences, past abodes the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He firmly undertook and persisted in skillful behaviors such as good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, giving and sharing, taking precepts, observing the sabbath, paying due respect to mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, honoring the elders in the family, and various other things pertaining to skillful behaviors. Due to performing, accumulating, heaping up, and amassing those deeds, when his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. There he surpassed the other gods in ten respects: divine life span, beauty, happiness, glory, sovereignty, sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. When he passed away from there and came back to this state of existence he obtained this mark of a great man: he has well-planted feet. He places his foot on the ground evenly, raises it evenly, and touches the ground evenly with the whole sole of his foot. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.5.1">Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. He has the following seven treasures: the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure. He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. After conquering this land girt by sea—free of harassment by bandits, successful and prosperous, safe, blessed, and untroubled—he reigns by principle, without rod or sword. And what does he obtain as king? He can’t be stopped by any human foe or enemy. That’s what he obtains as king. But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He can’t be stopped by any foe or enemy whether internal or external; nor by greed, hate, or delusion; nor by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world. That’s what he obtains as Buddha.” The Buddha spoke this matter. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.6.1">On this it is said: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn30:1.6.2">“Truth, principle, self-control, and restraint; <br/>purity, precepts, and observing the sabbath; <br/>giving, harmlessness, delighting in non-violence—<br/>firmly undertaking these things, he lived accordingly. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.6.6">By means of these deeds he went to heaven, <br/>where he enjoyed happiness and merriment. <br/>After passing away from there to here, <br/>he steps evenly on this rich earth. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.6.10">The gathered soothsayers predicted <br/>that there is no stopping one of such even tread, <br/>as householder or renunciate. <br/>That’s the meaning shown by this mark. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.6.14">While living at home he cannot be stopped, <br/>he defeats his foes, and cannot be beaten. <br/>Due to the fruit of that deed, <br/>he cannot be stopped by any human. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.6.18">But if he chooses the life gone forth, <br/>seeing clearly, loving renunciation, <br/>not even the best can hope to stop him; <br/>this is the nature of the supreme person.” </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 class="subheading">2. Wheels on the Feet </h3>
<p id="dn30:1.7.1">“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He brought happiness to many people, eliminating threats, terror, and danger, providing just protection and security, and giving gifts with all the trimmings. Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came back to this state of existence he obtained this mark: on the soles of his feet there are thousand-spoked wheels, with rims and hubs, complete in every detail and well divided inside. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.8.1">Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He has a large following of brahmins and householders, people of town and country, treasury officials, military officers, guardsmen, ministers, counselors, rulers, tax beneficiaries, and princes. That’s what he obtains as king. But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a fully awakened Buddha. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He has a large following of monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, humans, demons, dragons, and fairies. That’s what he obtains as Buddha.” The Buddha spoke this matter. </p>
<p id="dn30:1.9.1">On this it is said: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn30:1.9.2">“In olden days, in past lives, <br/>he brought happiness to many people, <br/>ridding them of fear, terror, and danger, <br/>eagerly guarding and protecting them. </p>

<p id="dn30:2.17.1">Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He has many close adherents among the brahmins and householders, people of town and country, treasury officials, military officers, guardsmen, ministers, counselors, rulers, tax beneficiaries, and princes. That’s what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He has many close adherents among the monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, humans, demons, dragons, and fairies. That’s what he obtains as Buddha.” The Buddha spoke this matter. </p>
<p id="dn30:2.18.1">On this it is said: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn30:2.18.2">“In past lives he was true to his promise, <br/>with no forked tongue, he shunned lies. <br/>He never broke his word to anyone, <br/>but spoke what was true, real, and factual. </p>
<p id="dn30:2.18.6">A tuft so very white like cotton-wool <br/>grew prettily between his eyebrows. <br/>And never two, but only one, <br/>hair grew in each of his pores. </p>
<p id="dn30:2.18.10">Many soothsayers learned in marks <br/>and expert in signs gathered and prophesied: <br/>‘One like this, with tuft and hair so well-formed, <br/>will have many as his close adherents. </p>

<h3 class="subheading">26–27. Forty Gapless Teeth </h3>
<p id="dn30:2.19.1">“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He refrained from divisive speech. He didn’t repeat in one place what he heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, he reconciled those who were divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony. Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came back to this state of existence he obtained these two marks: he has forty teeth, and his teeth have no gaps. </p>

<h3 class="subheading">31–32. Even and White Teeth </h3>
<p id="dn30:2.28.1">“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He gave up wrong livelihood and earned a living by right livelihood. He refrained from falsifying weights, metals, or measures; bribery, fraud, cheating, and duplicity; mutilation, murder, abduction, banditry, plunder, and violence. Due to performing, accumulating, heaping up, and amassing those deeds, when his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. There he surpassed the other gods in ten respects: divine life span, beauty, happiness, glory, sovereignty, sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. When he came back to this state of existence he obtained these two marks: his teeth are even and perfectly white. </p>
<p id="dn30:2.29.1">Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures. He has the following seven treasures: the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure. He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. After conquering this land girt by sea—free of harassment by bandits, successful and prosperous, safe, blessed, and untroubled—he reigns by principle, without rod or sword. And what does he obtain as king? His retinue is pure. This includes brahmins and householders, people of town and country, treasury officials, military officers, guardsmen, ministers, counselors, rulers, tax beneficiaries, and princes. That’s what he obtains as king. </p>
<p id="dn30:2.30.1">But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world.

<p id="dn31:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. Now at that time the householder’s son Sigālaka rose early and left Rājagaha. With his clothes and hair all wet, he raised his joined palms to revere the quarters—east, south, west, north, below, and above. </p>
<p id="dn31:2.1">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms. He saw Sigālaka revering the quarters and said to him, “Householder’s son, why are you revering the quarters in this way?” </p>
<p id="dn31:2.7">“Sir, on his deathbed my father said to me: ‘My dear, please revere the quarters.’ Honoring, respecting, and venerating my father’s words, I rose early and left Rājagaha and, with my clothes and hair all wet, raised my joined palms to revere the quarters—east, south, west, north, below, and above.” </p>
<h3 class="subheading">1. The Six Directions </h3>

<p id="dn31:2.13">“But sir, how should the six directions be revered in the training of the Noble One? Sir, please teach me this.” </p>
<p id="dn31:2.15">“Well then, householder’s son, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="dn31:2.16">“Yes, sir,” replied Sigālaka. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="dn31:3.1">“Householder’s son, a noble disciple gives up four corrupt deeds, doesn’t do bad deeds on four grounds, and avoids six drains on wealth. When they’ve left these fourteen bad things behind they have the six directions covered. They’re practicing to win in both worlds, and they succeed in this world and the next. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">2. Four Corrupt Deeds </h3>
<p id="dn31:3.5">What four corrupt deeds have they given up? Killing living creatures, stealing, sexual misconduct, and lying: these are corrupt deeds. These are the four corrupt deeds they’ve given up.” </p>
<p id="dn31:3.8">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>

<p id="dn31:5.1">“On what four grounds do they not do bad deeds? One does bad deeds prejudiced by favoritism, hostility, stupidity, and cowardice. When a noble disciple is not prejudiced by favoritism, hostility, stupidity, and cowardice, they don’t do bad deeds on these four grounds.” </p>

<h3 class="subheading">4. Six Drains on Wealth </h3>
<p id="dn31:7.1">“What six drains on wealth do they avoid? Habitually engaging in the following things is a drain on wealth: drinking alcohol; roaming the streets at night; frequenting festivals; gambling; bad friends; laziness. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">5. Six Drawbacks of Drinking </h3>
<p id="dn31:8.1">There are these six drawbacks of habitually drinking alcohol. Immediate loss of wealth, promotion of quarrels, susceptibility to illness, disrepute, indecent exposure; and weakened wisdom is the sixth thing. These are the six drawbacks of habitually drinking alcohol. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">6. Six Drawbacks of Roaming the Streets at Night </h3>
<p id="dn31:9.1">There are these six drawbacks of roaming the streets at night. Yourself, your partners and children, and your property are all left unguarded. You’re suspected of bad deeds. Untrue rumors spread about you. You’re at the forefront of many things that entail suffering. These are the six drawbacks of roaming the streets at night. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">7. Six Drawbacks of Festivals </h3>
<p id="dn31:10.1">There are these six drawbacks of frequenting festivals. You’re always thinking: ‘Where’s the dancing? Where’s the singing? Where’s the music? Where are the stories? Where’s the applause? Where are the kettledrums?’ These are the six drawbacks of frequenting festivals. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">8. Six Drawbacks of Gambling </h3>
<p id="dn31:11.1">There are these six drawbacks of habitually gambling. Victory breeds enmity. The loser mourns their money. There is immediate loss of wealth. A gambler’s word carries no weight in public assembly. Friends and colleagues treat them with contempt. And no-one wants to marry a gambler, for they think: ‘This individual is a gambler—they’re not able to support a partner.’ These are the six drawbacks of habitually gambling. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">9. Six Drawbacks of Bad Friends </h3>
<p id="dn31:12.1">There are these six drawbacks of bad friends. You become friends and companions with those who are addicts, carousers, drunkards, frauds, swindlers, and thugs. These are the six drawbacks of bad friends. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">10. Six Drawbacks of Laziness </h3>
<p id="dn31:13.1">There are these six drawbacks of habitual laziness. You don’t get your work done because you think: ‘It’s too cold! It’s too hot. It’s too late! It’s too early! I’m too hungry! I’m too full!’ By dwelling on so many excuses for not working, you don’t make any more money, and the money you already have runs out. These are the six drawbacks of habitual laziness.” </p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn31:14.1">“Some are just drinking buddies, <br/>some call you their dear, dear friend, <br/>but a true friend is one <br/>who stands by you in need. </p>

<p id="dn31:14.21">A drunkard, broke, and destitute, <br/>thirsty, drinking in the bar, <br/>drowning in debt, <br/>will quickly lose their way. </p>
<p id="dn31:14.25">When you’re in the habit of sleeping late, <br/>seeing night as time to rise, <br/>and always getting drunk, <br/>you can’t keep up the household life. </p>

<h3 class="subheading">13. Covering the Six Directions </h3>
<p id="dn31:27.1">“And how, householder’s son, does a noble disciple cover the six directions? These six directions should be recognized: parents as the east, teachers as the south, partner and children as the west, friends and colleagues as the north, bondservants and workers as beneath, and ascetics and brahmins as above. </p>
<p id="dn31:28.1">A child should serve their parents as the eastern quarter in five ways, thinking: ‘I will support those who supported me. I’ll do my duty for them. I’ll maintain the family traditions. I’ll take care of the inheritance. When they have passed away, I’ll make an offering on their behalf.’ Parents served by the children in these five ways show compassion to them in five ways. They keep them from doing bad. They support them in doing good. They train them in a profession. They connect them with a suitable partner. They transfer the inheritance in due time. Parents served by their children in these five ways show compassion to them in these five ways. And that’s how the eastern quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril. </p>
<p id="dn31:29.1">A student should serve their teacher as the southern quarter in five ways: by rising for them, by serving them, by listening well, by looking after them, and by carefully learning their profession. Teachers served by their students in these five ways show compassion to them in five ways. They make sure they’re well educated and well drilled in memorization. They clearly explain all the knowledge of the profession. They introduce them to their friends and colleagues. They provide protection in every region. Teachers served by their students in these five ways show compassion to them in these five ways. And that’s how the southern quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril. </p>
<p id="dn31:30.1">A husband should serve his wife as the western quarter in five ways: by treating her with honor, by not looking down on her, by not being unfaithful, by relinquishing authority to her, and by presenting her with adornments. A wife served by her husband in these five ways shows compassion to him in five ways. She’s well-organized in her work. She manages the domestic help. She’s not unfaithful. She preserves his earnings. She’s deft and tireless in all her duties. A wife served by her husband in these five ways shows compassion to him in these five ways. And that’s how the western quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril. </p>
<p id="dn31:31.1">A gentleman should serve his friends and colleagues as the northern quarter in five ways: giving, kindly words, taking care, equality, and not using tricky words. Friends and colleagues served by a gentleman in these five ways show compassion to him in five ways. They guard him when they’re negligent. They guard his property when they’re negligent. They keep him safe in times of danger. They don’t abandon him in times of trouble. They honor his descendants. Friends and colleagues served by a gentleman in these five ways show compassion to him in these five ways. And that’s how the northern quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril. </p>
<p id="dn31:32.1">A master should serve their bondservants and workers as the lower quarter in five ways: by organizing work according to ability, by paying food and wages, by nursing them when sick, by sharing special treats, and by giving time off work. Bondservants and workers served by a master in these five ways show compassion to him in five ways. They get up first, and go to bed last. They don’t steal. They do their work well. And they promote a good reputation. Bondservants and workers served by a master in these five ways show compassion to him in these five ways. And that’s how the lower quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril. </p>
<p id="dn31:33.1">A gentleman should serve ascetics and brahmins as the upper quarter in five ways: by loving deeds of body, speech, and mind, by not turning them away at the gate, and by providing them with material needs. Ascetics and brahmins served by a gentleman in these five ways show compassion to him in six ways. They keep him from doing bad. They support him in doing good. They think of him with kindly thoughts. They teach him what he does not know. They clarify what he’s already learned. They explain the path to heaven. Ascetics and brahmins served by a gentleman in these five ways show compassion to him in these six ways. And that’s how the upper quarter is covered, kept safe and free of peril.” </p>
<p id="dn31:33.7">The Buddha spoke this matter. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="dn31:34.1">“Parents are the east, <br/>teachers the south, <br/>wives and child the west, <br/>friends and colleagues the north, </p>
<p id="dn31:34.5">servants and workers below, <br/>and ascetics and brahmins above. <br/>By honoring these quarters <br/>a householder does enough for their family. </p>
<p id="dn31:34.9">The astute and the virtuous, <br/>the gentle and the articulate, <br/>the humble and the kind: <br/>they’re the kind who win glory. </p>
<p id="dn31:34.13">The diligent, not lazy, <br/>those not disturbed by troubles, <br/>those consistent in conduct, the intelligent: <br/>they’re the kind who win glory. </p>
<p id="dn31:34.17">The inclusive, the makers of friends, <br/>the bountiful, those rid of stinginess, <br/>those who lead, train, and persuade: <br/>they’re the kind who win glory. </p>
<p id="dn31:34.21">Giving and kindly words, <br/>taking care here, <br/>and treating equally in worldly conditions, <br/>as befits them in each case; <br/>these ways of being inclusive in the world <br/>are like a moving chariot’s linchpin. </p>
<p id="dn31:34.27">If there were no such ways of being inclusive, <br/>neither mother nor father <br/>would be respected and honored <br/>for what they’ve done for their children. </p>
<p id="dn31:34.31">But since these ways of being inclusive do exist, <br/>the astute do regard them well, <br/>so they achieve greatness <br/>and are praised.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="dn31:35.1">When this was said, Sigālaka the householder’s son said to the Buddha, “Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<h3 class="subheading">1. The First Recitation Section </h3>
<p id="dn32:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. Then, late at night, the Four Great Kings—with large armies of spirits, fairies, goblins, and dragons—set guards, troops, and wards at the four quarters and then, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak with their beauty, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Before sitting down to one side, some spirits bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. </p>
<p id="dn32:2.1">Seated to one side, the Great King Vessavaṇa said to the Buddha, “Sir, some high spirits have confidence in the Buddha, some do not. Some middling spirits have confidence in the Buddha, some do not. Some low spirits have confidence in the Buddha, some do not. But mostly the spirits don’t have confidence in the Buddha. Why is that? Because the Buddha teaches them to refrain from killing living creatures, stealing, lying, sexual misconduct, and drinking alcohol. But mostly they don’t refrain from such things. They don’t like that or approve of it. </p>
<p id="dn32:2.13">Sir, there are disciples of the Buddha who frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest that are quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat. There dwell high spirits who have no confidence in the Buddha’s dispensation. To give them confidence, may the Buddha please learn the Āṭānāṭiya protection for the guarding, protection, safety, and comfort of the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.” The Buddha consented in silence. </p>
<p id="dn32:3.1">Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, on that occasion Great King Vessavaṇa recited the Āṭānāṭiya protection. </p>

<p id="dn32:8.1">This, dear sir, is the Āṭānāṭiya protection for the guarding, protection, safety, and comfort of the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. </p>
<p id="dn32:8.2">The monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen should learn this Āṭānāṭiya protection well and completely memorize it. If anyone who does so is approached while walking, standing, sitting, or lying down by any non-human being with malicious intent—including males, females, boys, girls, ministers, counselors, and servants among the spirits, fairies, goblins, and dragons—that non-human will receive no homage or respect in any village or town. And they will receive no ground or dwelling in my capital of Ālakamandā. Nor will they get to go to the conference of the spirits. In addition, the non-humans would not give or take them in marriage. They’d heap personal abuse on them, drop an empty bowl on their head, and even split their head into seven pieces! </p>
<p id="dn32:9.1">For there are, dear sir, non-humans who are fierce, cruel, and violent. They don’t obey the Great Kings or their men or their men’s men. They’re said to be rebelling against the Great Kings. They’re just like the bandits in the king of Magadha’s realm who don’t obey the king, his men, or his men’s men, and are said to be rebelling against the king. </p>
<p id="dn32:9.6">If any non-human being with malicious intent—including males, females, boys, girls, ministers, counselors, and servants among the spirits, fairies, goblins, and dragons—approaches a monk, nun, layman, or laywoman while walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, one ought to yell, cry, and scream to the spirits, great spirits, generals, great generals: ‘This spirit’s got me! This spirit’s entered me! This spirit’s annoying me! This spirit’s harassing me! This spirit’s hurting me! This spirit’s harming me! This spirit won’t let me go!’ </p>

<p id="dn32:12.1">Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened, repeating all the verses spoken. Then he added: </p>
<p id="dn32:13.1">“Mendicants, learn the Āṭānāṭiya protection! Memorize the Āṭānāṭiya protection! Remember the Āṭānāṭiya protection! The Āṭānāṭiya protection is beneficial, and is for the guarding, protection, safety, and comfort of the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen.” </p>
<p id="dn32:13.5">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. </p>
</article>
<article id="dn33">
<h2 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">DN 33</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">Reciting in Concert </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Saṅgītisutta</span></h2>
<p id="dn33:1.1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Mallas together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a Mallian town named Pāvā. There he stayed in Cunda the smith’s mango grove. </p>
<p id="dn33:1.2.1">Now at that time a new town hall named Ubbhaṭaka had recently been constructed for the Mallas of Pāvā. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all. The Mallas of Pāvā also heard that the Buddha had arrived and was staying in Cunda’s mango grove. Then they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, a new town hall named Ubbhaṭaka has recently been constructed for the Mallas of Pāvā. It has not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all. May the Buddha be the first to use it, and only then will the Mallas of Pāvā use it. That would be for the lasting welfare and happiness of the Mallas of Pāvā.” The Buddha consented in silence. </p>
<p id="dn33:1.3.1">Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, the Mallas got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went to the new town hall, where they spread carpets all over, prepared seats, set up a water jar, and placed a lamp. Then they went back to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and told him of their preparations, saying, “Please, sir, come at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="dn33:1.4.1">Then the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the new town hall together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Having washed his feet he entered the town hall and sat against the central column facing east. The Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the west wall facing east, with the Buddha right in front of them. The Mallas of Pāvā also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the Buddha right in front of them. </p>
<p id="dn33:1.4.4">The Buddha spent most of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the Mallas with a Dhamma talk. Then he dismissed them, “The night is getting late, Vāseṭṭhas. Please go at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="dn33:1.4.7">“Yes, sir,” replied the Mallas. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving. </p>
<p id="dn33:1.5.1">Soon after they left, the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of mendicants, who were so very silent. He addressed Venerable Sāriputta, “Sāriputta, the Saṅgha of mendicants is rid of dullness and drowsiness. Give them some Dhamma talk as you feel inspired. My back is sore, I’ll stretch it.” </p>
<p id="dn33:1.5.6">“Yes, sir,” Sāriputta replied. </p>
<p id="dn33:1.5.7">And then the Buddha spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. </p>
<p id="dn33:1.6.1">Now at that time the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta had recently passed away at Pāvā. With his passing the Jain ascetics split, dividing into two factions, arguing, quarreling, and disputing, continually wounding each other with barbed words: “You don’t understand this teaching and training. I understand this teaching and training. What, you understand this teaching and training? You’re practicing wrong. I’m practicing right. I stay on topic, you don’t. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!” </p>
<p id="dn33:1.6.4">You’d think there was nothing but slaughter going on among the Jain ascetics. And the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta’s white-clothed lay disciples were disillusioned, dismayed, and disappointed in the Jain ascetics. They were equally disappointed with a teaching and training so poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha, with broken monument and without a refuge. </p>
<p id="dn33:1.7.1">Then Sāriputta told the mendicants about these things. He went on to say, “That’s what happens, reverends, when a teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha. But this teaching is well explained and well propounded to us by the Blessed One, emancipating, leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is a fully awakened Buddha. You should all recite this in concert, without disputing, so that this spiritual path may last for a long time. That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans. </p>
<p id="dn33:1.7.7">And what is that teaching? </p>
<h3 class="subheading">1. Ones </h3>
<p id="dn33:1.7.10">There are teachings grouped by one that have been rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.

<h3 class="subheading">4. Fours </h3>
<p id="dn33:1.11.1">There are teachings grouped by four that have been rightly explained by the Buddha. You should all recite these in concert. What are the teachings grouped by four? </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="dn33:1.11.4">Four kinds of mindfulness meditation. It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="dn33:1.11.9">Four right efforts. A mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are completed by development. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="dn33:1.11.14">Four bases of psychic power. A mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort. They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to mental development, and active effort. They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy, and active effort. They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to inquiry, and active effort. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="dn33:1.11.19">Four absorptions. A mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. </p>
<p id="dn33:1.11.24">Four ways of developing immersion further. There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to blissful meditation in the present life. There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to gaining knowledge and vision. There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to mindfulness and awareness. There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to the ending of defilements. </p>
<p data-counter="5.1" id="dn33:1.11.29">And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to blissful meditation in the present life? It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … fourth absorption. This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to blissful meditation in the present life. </p>
<p data-counter="5.2" id="dn33:1.11.34">And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to gaining knowledge and vision? A mendicant focuses on the perception of light, concentrating on the perception of day regardless of whether it’s night or day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance. This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to gaining knowledge and vision. </p>
<p data-counter="5.3" id="dn33:1.11.38">And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to mindfulness and awareness? A mendicant knows feelings as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. They know perceptions as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. They know thoughts as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to mindfulness and awareness. </p>
<p data-counter="5.4" id="dn33:1.11.43">And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to the ending of defilements? A mendicant meditates observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates. ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such are feelings … perceptions … choices … consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to the ending of defilements. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="dn33:1.11.51">Four immeasurables. A mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion … rejoicing … equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="dn33:1.11.56">Four formless states. A mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness. Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, they enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="dn33:1.11.61">Four supports. After appraisal, a mendicant uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and gets rid of some things. </p>
<p data-counter="9.1" id="dn33:1.11.63">Four noble traditions. A mendicant is content with any kind of robe, and praises such contentment. They don’t try to get hold of a robe in an improper way. They don’t get upset if they don’t get a robe. And if they do get a robe, they use it untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawback, and understanding the escape. And on account of that they don’t glorify themselves or put others down. A mendicant who is deft, tireless, aware, and mindful in this is said to stand in the ancient, primordial noble tradition. </p>
<p data-counter="9.2" id="dn33:1.11.66">Furthermore, a mendicant is content with any kind of almsfood … </p>
<p data-counter="9.3" id="dn33:1.11.68">Furthermore, a mendicant is content with any kind of lodgings … </p>
<p data-counter="9.4" id="dn33:1.11.70">Furthermore, a mendicant enjoys giving up and loves to give up. They enjoy meditation and love to meditate. But they don’t glorify themselves or put down others on account of their love for giving up and meditation. A mendicant who is deft, tireless, aware, and mindful in this is said to stand in the ancient, primordial noble tradition. </p>
<p data-counter="10.1" id="dn33:1.11.72">Four efforts. The efforts to restrain, to give up, to develop, and to preserve. And what is the effort to restrain? When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint. When they hear a sound with their ears … When they smell an odor with their nose … When they taste a flavor with their tongue … When they feel a touch with their body … When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint. This is called the effort to restrain. </p>
<p data-counter="10.2" id="dn33:1.11.84">And what is the effort to give up? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that’s arisen, but gives it up, gets rid of it, eliminates it, and obliterates it. They don’t tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them. This is called the effort to give up. </p>
<p data-counter="10.3" id="dn33:1.11.90">And what is the effort to develop? It’s when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. This is called the effort to develop. </p>
<p data-counter="10.4" id="dn33:1.11.99">And what is the effort to preserve? It’s when a mendicant preserves a meditation subject that’s a fine foundation of immersion: the perception of a skeleton, a worm-infested corpse, a livid corpse, a split open corpse, or a bloated corpse. This is called the effort to preserve. </p>
<p data-counter="11" id="dn33:1.11.102">Four knowledges: knowledge of the present phenomena, inferential knowledge, knowledge of others’ minds, and conventional knowledge. </p>
<p data-counter="12" id="dn33:1.11.104">Another four knowledges: knowing about suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. </p>
<p data-counter="13" id="dn33:1.11.106">Four factors of stream-entry: associating with good people, listening to the true teaching, proper attention, and practicing in line with the teaching. </p>
<p data-counter="14" id="dn33:1.11.108">Four factors of a stream-enterer. A noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ They have experiential confidence in the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ And a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. </p>
<p data-counter="15" id="dn33:1.11.116">Four fruits of the ascetic life: stream-entry, once-return, non-return, and perfection. </p>
<p data-counter="16" id="dn33:1.11.118">Four elements: earth, water, fire, and air. </p>
<p data-counter="17" id="dn33:1.11.120">Four foods: solid food, whether coarse or fine; contact is the second, mental intention the third, and consciousness the fourth. </p>
<p data-counter="18" id="dn33:1.11.122">Four bases for consciousness to remain. As long as consciousness remains, it remains involved with form, supported by form, founded on form. And with a sprinkle of relishing, it grows, increases, and matures. Or consciousness remains involved with feeling … Or consciousness remains involved with perception … Or as long as consciousness remains, it remains involved with choices, supported by choices, grounded on choices. And with a sprinkle of relishing, it grows, increases, and matures. </p>
<p data-counter="19" id="dn33:1.11.127">Four prejudices: making decisions prejudiced by favoritism, hostility, stupidity, and cowardice. </p>
<p data-counter="20" id="dn33:1.11.129">Four things that give rise to craving. Craving arises in a mendicant for the sake of robes, almsfood, lodgings, or rebirth in this or that state. </p>
<p data-counter="21" id="dn33:1.11.134">Four ways of practice: painful practice with slow insight, painful practice with swift insight, pleasant practice with slow insight, and pleasant practice with swift insight. </p>
<p data-counter="22" id="dn33:1.11.136">Another four ways of practice: impatient practice, patient practice, taming practice, and calming practice. </p>
<p data-counter="23" id="dn33:1.11.138">Four footprints of the Dhamma: contentment, good will, right mindfulness, and right immersion. </p>
<p data-counter="24" id="dn33:1.11.140">Four ways of taking up practices. There is a way of taking up practices that is painful now and results in future pain. There is a way of taking up practices that is painful now but results in future pleasure. There is a way of taking up practices that is pleasant now but results in future pain. There is a way of taking up practices that is pleasant now and results in future pleasure. </p>
<p data-counter="25" id="dn33:1.11.145">Four spectrums of the teaching: ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom. </p>
<p data-counter="26" id="dn33:1.11.147">Four powers: energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. </p>
<p data-counter="27" id="dn33:1.11.149">Four foundations: the foundations of wisdom, truth, generosity, and peace. </p>
<p data-counter="28" id="dn33:1.11.151">Four ways of answering questions. There is a question that should be answered definitively. There is a question that should be answered analytically. There is a question that should be answered with a counter-question. There is a question that should be set aside. </p>
<p data-counter="29" id="dn33:1.11.153">Four deeds. There are deeds that are dark with dark result. There are deeds that are bright with bright result. There are deeds that are dark and bright with dark and bright result. There are neither dark nor bright deeds with neither dark nor bright results, which lead to the ending of deeds. </p>
<p data-counter="30" id="dn33:1.11.158">Four things to be realized. Past lives are to be realized with recollection. The passing away and rebirth of sentient beings is to be realized with vision. The eight liberations are to be realized with direct meditative experience. The ending of defilements is to be realized with wisdom. </p>
<p data-counter="31" id="dn33:1.11.163">Four floods: sensuality, desire for rebirth, views, and ignorance. </p>
<p data-counter="32" id="dn33:1.11.165">Four bonds: sensuality, desire for rebirth, views, and ignorance. </p>

Whatever they give, they expect something back. They see an affluent aristocrat or brahmin or householder amusing themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. They think: ‘If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders!’ They settle on that thought, concentrate on it and develop it. As they’ve settled for less and not developed further, their thought leads to rebirth there. But I say that this is only for those of ethical conduct, not for the unethical. The heart’s wish of an ethical person succeeds because of their purity. </p>

<p data-counter="7.5" id="dn34:1.7.57">Take another mendicant who says: ‘I’ve developed the signless release of the heart. … Yet somehow my consciousness still follows after signs.’ They should be told, ‘Not so, venerable! … For it is the signless release of the heart that is the escape from all signs.’ </p>
<p data-counter="7.6" id="dn34:1.7.62">Take another mendicant who says: ‘I’m rid of the conceit “I am”. And I don’t regard anything as “I am this”. Yet somehow the dart of doubt and indecision still occupies my mind.’ They should be told, ‘Not so, venerable! Don’t say that. Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that. It’s impossible, reverend, it cannot happen that the conceit “I am” has been done away with, and nothing is regarded as “I am this”, yet somehow the dart of doubt and indecision still occupy the mind. For it is the uprooting of the conceit “I am” that is the escape from the dart of doubt and indecision.’ </p>
<p id="dn34:1.7.70">What six things should be produced? Six consistent responses. A mendicant, seeing a sight with their eyes, is neither happy nor sad. They remain equanimous, mindful and aware. Hearing a sound with their ears … Smelling an odor with their nose … Tasting a flavor with their tongue … </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="dn34:1.7.76">Feeling a touch with their body … Knowing a thought with their mind, they’re neither happy nor sad. They remain equanimous, mindful and aware. </p>

<p data-counter="10.1" id="dn34:1.7.83">What six things should be realized? Six direct knowledges. A mendicant wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm. </p>
<p data-counter="10.2" id="dn34:1.7.86">With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far. </p>
<p data-counter="10.3" id="dn34:1.7.87">They understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind. </p>

<p data-counter="10.6" id="dn34:1.7.92">They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. </p>

<h3 class="subheading">8. Groups of Eight </h3>
<p id="dn34:2.1.1">Eight things are helpful, etc. </p>
<p data-counter="1.1" id="dn34:2.1.2">What eight things are helpful? There are eight causes and reasons that lead to acquiring the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life, and to its increase, growth, development, and fulfillment once it has been acquired. What eight? It’s when a mendicant lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role. And they set up a keen sense of conscience and prudence for them, with warmth and respect. This is the first cause. </p>
<p data-counter="1.2" id="dn34:2.1.7">When a mendicant lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role—with a keen sense of conscience and prudence for them, with warmth and respect—from time to time they go and ask them questions: ‘Why, sir, does it say this? What does that mean?’ Those venerables clarify what is unclear, reveal what is obscure, and dispel doubt regarding the many doubtful matters. This is the second cause. </p>
<p data-counter="1.3" id="dn34:2.1.12">After hearing that teaching they perfect withdrawal of both body and mind. This is the third cause. </p>
<p data-counter="1.4" id="dn34:2.1.14">Furthermore, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. This is the fourth cause. </p>
<p data-counter="1.5" id="dn34:2.1.16">Furthermore, a mendicant is very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically. This is the fifth cause. </p>
<p data-counter="1.6" id="dn34:2.1.18">Furthermore, a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. This is the sixth cause. </p>
<p data-counter="1.7" id="dn34:2.1.20">Furthermore, a mendicant is mindful. They have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember and recall what was said and done long ago. This is the seventh cause. </p>
<p data-counter="1.8" id="dn34:2.1.22">Furthermore, a mendicant meditates observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates. ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling. Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is the ending of perception. Such are choices, such is the origin of choices, such is the ending of choices. Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ This is the eighth cause. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="dn34:2.1.30">What eight things should be developed? The noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. </p>

<p data-counter="5.1" id="dn34:2.1.42">What eight things make things worse? Eight grounds for laziness. Firstly, a mendicant has some work to do. They think: ‘I have some work to do. But while doing it my body will get tired. I’d better have a lie down.’ They lie down, and don’t rouse energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized. This is the first ground for laziness. </p>
<p data-counter="5.2" id="dn34:2.1.49">Furthermore, a mendicant has done some work. They think: ‘I’ve done some work. But while working my body got tired. I’d better have a lie down.’ They lie down, and don’t rouse energy… This is the second ground for laziness. </p>
<p data-counter="5.3" id="dn34:2.1.54">Furthermore, a mendicant has to go on a journey. They think: ‘I have to go on a journey. But while walking my body will get tired. I’d better have a lie down.’ They lie down, and don’t rouse energy… This is the third ground for laziness. </p>
<p data-counter="5.4" id="dn34:2.1.59">Furthermore, a mendicant has gone on a journey. They think: ‘I’ve gone on a journey. But while walking my body got tired. I’d better have a lie down.’ They lie down, and don’t rouse energy… This is the fourth ground for laziness. </p>
<p data-counter="5.5" id="dn34:2.1.64">Furthermore, a mendicant has wandered for alms, but they didn’t get to fill up on as much food as they like, rough or fine.

I’d better have a lie down.’… They lie down, and don’t rouse energy… This is the sixth ground for laziness. </p>
<p data-counter="5.7" id="dn34:2.1.73">Furthermore, a mendicant feels a little sick. They think: ‘I feel a little sick. Lying down would be good for me. I’d better have a lie down.’ They lie down, and don’t rouse energy… This is the seventh ground for laziness. </p>
<p data-counter="5.8" id="dn34:2.1.77">Furthermore, a mendicant has recently recovered from illness. They think: ‘I’ve recently recovered from illness. My body is weak and unfit for work. I’d better have a lie down.’ They lie down, and don’t rouse energy… This is the eighth ground for laziness. </p>
<p data-counter="6.1" id="dn34:2.1.84">What eight things lead to distinction? Eight grounds for arousing energy. Firstly, a mendicant has some work to do. They think: ‘I have some work to do. While working it’s not easy to focus on the instructions of the Buddhas. I’d better preemptively rouse up energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized.’ They rouse energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized. This is the first ground for arousing energy. </p>
<p data-counter="6.2" id="dn34:2.1.90">Furthermore, a mendicant has done some work. They think: ‘I’ve done some work. While I was working I wasn’t able to focus on the instructions of the Buddhas. I’d better preemptively rouse up energy.’… This is the second ground for arousing energy. </p>
<p data-counter="6.3" id="dn34:2.1.94">Furthermore, a mendicant has to go on a journey. They think: ‘I have to go on a journey. While walking it’s not easy to focus on the instructions of the Buddhas. I’d better preemptively rouse up energy.’… This is the third ground for arousing energy. </p>

This is the eighth ground for arousing energy. </p>
<p data-counter="7.1" id="dn34:2.1.121">What eight things are hard to comprehend? Eight lost opportunities for spiritual practice. Firstly, a Realized One has arisen in the world.

<p data-counter="7.5" id="dn34:2.1.135">Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. But a person has been reborn in the borderlands, among strange barbarian tribes, where monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen do not go. This is the fifth lost opportunity for spiritual practice. </p>
<p data-counter="7.6" id="dn34:2.1.138">Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. And a person is reborn in a central country. But they have wrong view and distorted perspective: ‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’ This is the sixth lost opportunity for spiritual practice. </p>
<p data-counter="7.7" id="dn34:2.1.142">Furthermore, a Realized One has arisen in the world. And a person is reborn in a central country.

<p id="dn34:2.2.1">Nine things are helpful, etc. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="dn34:2.2.2">What nine things are helpful? Nine things rooted in proper attention. When you attend properly, joy springs up. When you’re joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, you feel bliss. And when you’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed. When your mind is immersed, you truly know and see. When you truly know and see, you grow disillusioned. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away you’re freed. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="dn34:2.2.5">What nine things should be developed? Nine factors of trying to be pure. The factors of trying to be pure in ethics, mind, view, overcoming doubt, knowledge and vision of the variety of paths, knowledge and vision of the practice, knowledge and vision, wisdom, and freedom. </p>

<p data-counter="3.5" id="dn34:2.2.19">There are sentient beings that are non-percipient and do not experience anything, such as the gods who are non-percipient beings. This is the fifth abode of sentient beings. </p>
<p data-counter="3.6" id="dn34:2.2.21">There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond perceptions of form. With the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they have been reborn in the dimension of infinite space. This is the sixth abode of sentient beings. </p>
<p data-counter="3.7" id="dn34:2.2.23">There are sentient beings that have gone totally beyond the dimension of infinite space. Aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they have been reborn in the dimension of infinite consciousness. This is the seventh abode of sentient beings. </p>

<p data-counter="4" id="dn34:2.2.30">What nine things should be given up? Nine things rooted in craving. Craving is a cause of seeking. Seeking is a cause of gaining material possessions. Gaining material possessions is a cause of assessing. Assessing is a cause of desire and lust. Desire and lust is a cause of attachment. Attachment is a cause of ownership. Ownership is a cause of stinginess. Stinginess is a cause of safeguarding. Owing to safeguarding, many bad, unskillful things come to be: taking up the rod and the sword, quarrels, arguments, disputes, accusations, divisive speech, and lies. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="dn34:2.2.34">What nine things make things worse? Nine grounds for resentment. Thinking: ‘They did wrong to me,’ you harbor resentment. Thinking: ‘They are doing wrong to me’ … ‘They will do wrong to me’ … ‘They did wrong by someone I love’ … ‘They are doing wrong by someone I love’ … ‘They will do wrong by someone I love’ … ‘They helped someone I dislike’ … ‘They are helping someone I dislike’ … Thinking: ‘They will help someone I dislike,’ you harbor resentment. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="dn34:2.2.46">What nine things lead to distinction? Nine methods to get rid of resentment. Thinking: ‘They did wrong to me, but what can I possibly do?’ you get rid of resentment. Thinking: ‘They are doing wrong to me …’ … ‘They will do wrong to me …’ … ‘They did wrong by someone I love …’ … ‘They are doing wrong by someone I love …’ … ‘They will do wrong by someone I love …’ … ‘They helped someone I dislike …’ … ‘They are helping someone I dislike …’ … Thinking: ‘They will help someone I dislike, but what can I possibly do?’ you get rid of resentment. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="dn34:2.2.58">What nine things are hard to comprehend? Nine kinds of diversity. Diversity of elements gives rise to diversity of contacts. Diversity of contacts gives rise to diversity of feelings. Diversity of feelings gives rise to diversity of perceptions. Diversity of perceptions gives rise to diversity of thoughts. Diversity of thoughts gives rise to diversity of desires. Diversity of desires gives rise to diversity of passions. Diversity of passions gives rise to diversity of searches. Diversity of searches gives rise to diversity of gains. </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="dn34:2.2.62">What nine things should be produced? Nine perceptions: the perceptions of ugliness, death, repulsiveness in food, dissatisfaction with the whole world, impermanence, suffering in impermanence, not-self in suffering, giving up, and fading away. </p>
<p data-counter="9" id="dn34:2.2.66">What nine things should be directly known? Nine progressive meditations. A mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space. Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness. Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, they enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling. </p>
<p data-counter="10" id="dn34:2.2.78">What nine things should be realized? Nine progressive cessations. For someone who has attained the first absorption, sensual perceptions have ceased. For someone who has attained the second absorption, the placing of the mind and keeping it connected have ceased. For someone who has attained the third absorption, rapture has ceased. For someone who has attained the fourth absorption, breathing has ceased. For someone who has attained the dimension of infinite space, the perception of form has ceased. For someone who has attained the dimension of infinite consciousness, the perception of the dimension of infinite space has ceased. For someone who has attained the dimension of nothingness, the perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness has ceased. For someone who has attained the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, the perception of the dimension of nothingness has ceased. For someone who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have ceased. </p>
<p id="dn34:2.2.90">So these ninety things that are true, real, and accurate, not unreal, not otherwise were rightly awakened to by the Realized One. </p>
<h3 class="subheading">10. Groups of Ten </h3>
<p id="dn34:2.3.1">Ten things are helpful, ten things should be developed, ten things should be completely understood, ten things should be given up, ten things make things worse, ten things lead to distinction, ten things are hard to comprehend, ten things should be produced, ten things should be directly known, ten things should be realized. </p>
<p data-counter="1.1" id="dn34:2.3.2">What ten things are helpful? Ten qualities that serve as protector. First, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. This is a quality that serves as protector. </p>
<p data-counter="1.2" id="dn34:2.3.7">Furthermore, a mendicant is learned. This too is a quality that serves as protector. </p>
<p data-counter="1.3" id="dn34:2.3.10">Furthermore, a mendicant has good friends, companions, and associates. This too is a quality that serves as protector. </p>
<p data-counter="1.4" id="dn34:2.3.13">Furthermore, a mendicant is easy to admonish, having qualities that make them easy to admonish. They’re patient, and take instruction respectfully. This too is a quality that serves as protector. </p>
<p data-counter="1.5" id="dn34:2.3.16">Furthermore, a mendicant is deft and tireless in a diverse spectrum of duties for their spiritual companions, understanding how to go about things in order to complete and organize the work. This too is a quality that serves as protector. </p>
<p data-counter="1.6" id="dn34:2.3.19">Furthermore, a mendicant loves the teachings and is a delight to converse with, being full of joy in the teaching and training. This too is a quality that serves as protector. </p>
<p data-counter="1.7" id="dn34:2.3.22">Furthermore, a mendicant is content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. This too is a quality that serves as protector. </p>
<p data-counter="1.8" id="dn34:2.3.25">Furthermore, a mendicant is energetic. This too is a quality that serves as protector. </p>
<p data-counter="1.9" id="dn34:2.3.28">Furthermore, a mendicant is mindful. They have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember and recall what was said and done long ago. This too is a quality that serves as protector. </p>
<p data-counter="1.10" id="dn34:2.3.31">Furthermore, a mendicant is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. This too is a quality that serves as protector. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="dn34:2.3.35">What ten things should be developed? Ten universal dimensions of meditation. Someone perceives the meditation on universal earth above, below, across, undivided and limitless. They perceive the meditation on universal water … the meditation on universal fire … the meditation on universal air … the meditation on universal blue … the meditation on universal yellow … the meditation on universal red … the meditation on universal white … the meditation on universal space … They perceive the meditation on universal consciousness above, below, across, undivided and limitless. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="dn34:2.3.48">What ten things should be completely understood? Ten sense fields: eye and sights, ear and sounds, nose and smells, tongue and tastes, body and touches. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="dn34:2.3.52">What ten things should be given up? Ten wrong ways: wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, wrong immersion, wrong knowledge, and wrong freedom. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="dn34:2.3.56">What ten things make things worse? Ten ways of doing unskillful deeds: killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct; speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; covetousness, ill will, and wrong view. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="dn34:2.3.60">What ten things lead to distinction? Ten ways of doing skillful deeds: refraining from killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct; avoiding speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical; contentment, good will, and right view. </p>
<p id="dn34:2.3.64">What ten things are hard to comprehend? Ten noble abodes. A mendicant has given up five factors, possesses six factors, has a single guard, has four supports, has eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth, has totally given up searching, has unsullied intentions, has stilled the physical process, and is well freed in mind and well freed by wisdom. </p>
<p data-counter="7.1" id="dn34:2.3.67">And how has a mendicant given up five factors? It’s when a mendicant has given up sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. That’s how a mendicant has given up five factors. </p>
<p id="dn34:2.3.70">And how does a mendicant possess six factors? A mendicant, seeing a sight with their eyes, is neither happy nor sad. They remain equanimous, mindful and aware. Hearing a sound with their ears … Smelling an odor with their nose … Tasting a flavor with their tongue … </p>
<p data-counter="7.2" id="dn34:2.3.75">Feeling a touch with their body … Knowing a thought with their mind, they’re neither happy nor sad. They remain equanimous, mindful and aware. That’s how a mendicant possesses six factors. </p>
<p data-counter="7.3" id="dn34:2.3.78">And how does a mendicant have a single guard? It’s when a mendicant’s heart is guarded by mindfulness. That’s how a mendicant has a single guard. </p>
<p data-counter="7.4" id="dn34:2.3.81">And how does a mendicant have four supports? After appraisal, a mendicant uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and gets rid of some things. That’s how a mendicant has four supports. </p>
<p data-counter="7.5" id="dn34:2.3.84">And how has a mendicant eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth? Different ascetics and brahmins have different idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth. A mendicant has dispelled, eliminated, thrown out, rejected, let go of, given up, and relinquished all these. That’s how a mendicant has eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth. </p>
<p data-counter="7.6" id="dn34:2.3.87">And how has a mendicant totally given up searching? It’s when they’ve given up searching for sensual pleasures, for continued existence, and for a spiritual path. That’s how a mendicant has totally given up searching. </p>
<p data-counter="7.7" id="dn34:2.3.90">And how does a mendicant have unsullied intentions? It’s when they’ve given up sensual, malicious, and cruel intentions. That’s how a mendicant has unsullied intentions. </p>
<p data-counter="7.8" id="dn34:2.3.93">And how has a mendicant stilled the physical process? Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. That’s how a mendicant has stilled the physical process. </p>
<p data-counter="7.9" id="dn34:2.3.96">And how is a mendicant well freed in mind? It’s when a mendicant’s mind is freed from greed, hate, and delusion. That’s how a mendicant is well freed in mind. </p>
<p data-counter="7.10" id="dn34:2.3.99">And how is a mendicant well freed by wisdom? It’s when a mendicant understands: ‘I’ve given up greed, hate, and delusion, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so they’re unable to arise in the future.’ That’s how a mendicant’s mind is well freed by wisdom. </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="dn34:2.3.107">What ten things should be produced? Ten perceptions: the perceptions of ugliness, death, repulsiveness in food, dissatisfaction with the whole world, impermanence, suffering in impermanence, not-self in suffering, giving up, fading away, and cessation. </p>
<p data-counter="9" id="dn34:2.3.111">What ten things should be directly known? Ten grounds for wearing away. For one of right view, wrong view is worn away. And the many bad, unskillful qualities that arise because of wrong view are worn away. For one of right intention, wrong intention is worn away. … For one of right speech, wrong speech is worn away. … For one of right action, wrong action is worn away. … For one of right livelihood, wrong livelihood is worn away. … For one of right effort, wrong effort is worn away. … For one of right mindfulness, wrong mindfulness is worn away. … For one of right immersion, wrong immersion is worn away. … For one of right knowledge, wrong knowledge is worn away. … For one of right freedom, wrong freedom is worn away. And the many bad, unskillful qualities that arise because of wrong freedom are worn away. </p>
<p data-counter="10" id="dn34:2.3.126">What ten things should be realized? Ten qualities of an adept: an adept’s right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right immersion, right knowledge, and right freedom. </p>
<p id="dn34:2.3.130">So these hundred things that are true, real, and accurate, not unreal, not otherwise were rightly awakened to by the Realized One.” This is what Venerable Sāriputta said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what Sāriputta said. </p>

<h2>The Translator</h2>
<p><span property="dc:creator">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> was born as Anthony Aidan Best on <span class="dc:date">4/11/1966</span> in Perth, Western Australia. He grew up in the pleasant suburbs of Mt Lawley and Attadale alongside his sister Nicola, who was the good child. His mother, Margaret Lorraine Huntsman née Pinder, said “he’ll either be a priest or a poet”, while his father, Anthony Thomas Best, advised him to “never do anything for money”. He attended Aquinas College, a Catholic school, where he decided to become an atheist. At the University of WA he studied philosophy, aiming to learn what he wanted to do with his life. Finding that what he wanted to do was play guitar, he dropped out. His main band was named Martha’s Vineyard, which achieved modest success in the indie circuit. </p>
<p>A seemingly random encounter with a roadside joey took him to Thailand, where he entered his first meditation retreat at Wat Ram Poeng, Chieng Mai in 1992. Feeling the call to the Buddha’s path, he took full ordination in Wat Pa Nanachat in 1994, where his teachers were Ajahn Pasanno and Ajahn Jayasaro. In 1997 he returned to Perth to study with Ajahn Brahm at Bodhinyana Monastery. </p>
<p>He spent several years practicing in seclusion in Malaysia and Thailand before establishing Santi Forest Monastery in Bundanoon, NSW, in 2003. There he was instrumental in supporting the establishment of the Theravada bhikkhuni order in Australia and advocating for women’s rights. He continues to teach in Australia and globally, with a special concern for the moral implications of climate change and other forms of environmental destruction. He has published a series of books of original and groundbreaking research on early Buddhism. </p>
<p>In 2005 he founded SuttaCentral together with Rod Bucknell and John Kelly. In 2015, seeing the need for a complete, accurate, plain English translation of the Pali texts, he undertook the task, spending nearly three years in isolation on the isle of Qi Mei off the coast of the nation of Taiwan. He completed the four main Nikāyas in 2018, and the early books of the Khuddaka Nikāya were complete by 2021. All this work is dedicated to the public domain and is entirely free of copyright encumbrance. </p>
<p>In 2019 he returned to Sydney where he established Lokanta Vihara (The Monastery at the End of the World). </p>
<h2>Creation Process</h2>
<p>Primary source was the digital Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali Tipiṭaka. Translated from the Pali, with reference to several English translations, especially those of Bhikkhu Bodhi. Older translations by Maurice Walshe and T.W. and C.A.F. Rhys Davids were also consulted.</p>
<h2>The Translation</h2>
<p>This translation was part of a project to translate the four Pali Nikāyas with the following aims: plain, approachable English; consistent terminology; accurate rendition of the Pali; free of copyright. It was made during 2016–2018 while Bhikkhu Sujato was staying in Qimei, Taiwan.</p>
<h2>About SuttaCentral</h2>
