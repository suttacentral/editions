<h1>The SuttaCentral Editions Series</h1>
<p>Since 2005 SuttaCentral has provided access to the texts, translations, and parallels of early Buddhist texts. In 2018 we started creating and publishing our own translations of these seminal spiritual classics. The “Editions” series now makes selected translations available as books in various forms, including print, PDF, and EPUB.</p>
<p>Editions are selected from our most complete, well-crafted, and reliable translations. They aim to bring these texts to a wider audience in forms that reward mindful reading. Care is taken with every detail of the production, and we aim to meet or exceed professional best standards in every way. These are the core scriptures underlying the entire Buddhist tradition, and we believe that they deserve to be preserved and made available in highest quality without compromise.</p>
<p>SuttaCentral is a charitable organization. Our work is accomplished by volunteers and through the generosity of our donors. Everything we create is offered to all of humanity free of any copyright or licensing restrictions. </p>

<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
<p>I remember with gratitude all those from whom I have learned the Dhamma, especially Ajahn Brahm and Bhikkhu Bodhi, the two monks who more than anyone else showed me the depth, meaning, and practical value of the Suttas.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Dustin and Keiko Cheah and family, who sponsored my stay in Qi Mei while I made this translation.</p>
<p>Thanks also for Blake Walshe, who provided essential software support for my translation work.</p>
<p>Throughout the process of translation, I have frequently sought feedback and suggestions from the community on the SuttaCentral community on our forum, “Discuss and Discover”. I want to thank all those who have made suggestions and contributed to my understanding, as well as to the moderators who have made the forum possible. My thinking around the economics of meat-eating in the Āmagandhasutta was prompted by the forum users Bhikkhu Khemaratana and Prajnadeva. A special thanks is due to Sabbamittā, a true friend of all, who has tirelessly and precisely checked my work. </p>
<p>Finally my everlasting thanks to all those people, far too many to mention, who have supported SuttaCentral, and those who have supported my life as a monastic. None of this would be possible without you.</p>

<p id="snp1.4:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Magadhans in the Southern Hills near the brahmin village of Ekanāḷa. Now at that time the brahmin Bhāradvāja the Farmer had harnessed around five hundred plows, it being the season for sowing. Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to where Bhāradvāja the Farmer was working. Now at that time Bhāradvāja the Farmer was distributing food. Then the Buddha went to where the distribution was taking place and stood to one side. </p>
<p id="snp1.4:2.1">Bhāradvāja the Farmer saw him standing for alms and said to him, “I plough and sow, ascetic, and then I eat. You too should plough and sow, then you may eat.” </p>
<p id="snp1.4:3.1">“I too plough and sow, brahmin, and then I eat.” “I don’t see Master Gotama with a yoke or plow or plowshare or goad or oxen, yet he says: ‘I too plough and sow, brahmin, and then I eat.’” </p>
<p id="snp1.4:4.1">Then Bhāradvāja the Farmer addressed the Buddha in verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="snp1.4:5.1">“You claim to be a farmer, <br/>but I don’t see you farming. <br/>Tell me your farming when asked, <br/>so I can recognize your farming.” </p>
<p id="snp1.4:6.1">“Faith is my seed, austerity my rain, <br/>and wisdom is my yoke and plough. <br/>Conscience is my pole, mind my strap, <br/>mindfulness my plowshare and goad. </p>
<p id="snp1.4:7.1">Guarded in body and speech, <br/>I restrict my intake of food. <br/>I use truth as my scythe, <br/>and gentleness is my release. </p>
<p id="snp1.4:8.1">Energy is my beast of burden, <br/>transporting me to a place of sanctuary. <br/>It goes without turning back <br/>where there is no sorrow. </p>
<p id="snp1.4:9.1">That’s how to do the farming <br/>that has the Deathless as its fruit. <br/>When you finish this farming <br/>you’re released from all suffering.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="snp1.4:10.1">Then Bhāradvāja the Farmer filled a large bronze dish with milk-rice and presented it to the Buddha: “Eat the milk-rice, Master Gotama, you are truly a farmer. For Master Gotama does the farming that has the Deathless as its fruit.” </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="snp1.4:11.1">“Food enchanted by a spell isn’t fit for me to eat. <br/>That’s not the principle of those who see, brahmin. <br/>The Buddhas reject things enchanted with spells. <br/>Since there is such a principle, brahmin, that’s how they live. </p>
<p id="snp1.4:12.1">Serve with other food and drink <br/>the consummate one, the great hermit, <br/>with defilements ended and remorse stilled. <br/>For he is the field for the seeker of merit.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="snp1.4:13.1">“Then, Master Gotama, to whom should I give the milk-rice?” “Brahmin, I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who can properly digest this milk-rice, except for the Realized One or one of his disciples. Well then, brahmin, throw out the milk-rice where there is little that grows, or drop it into water that has no living creatures.” </p>
<p id="snp1.4:14.1">So Bhāradvāja the Farmer dropped the milk-rice in water that had no living creatures. And when the milk-rice was placed in the water, it sizzled and hissed, steaming and fuming. Suppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day. If you placed it in the water, it would sizzle and hiss, steaming and fuming. In the same way, when the milk-rice was placed in the water, it sizzled and hissed, steaming and fuming. </p>
<p id="snp1.4:15.1">Then Bhāradvāja the Farmer, shocked and awestruck,  went up to the Buddha, bowed down with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said, “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” </p>
<p id="snp1.4:16.1">And Bhāradvāja the Farmer received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the perfected. </p>

<p id="snp2.12:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Āḷavī, at the Aggāḷava Tree-shrine. Now at that time it was not long after Venerable Vaṅgīsa’s mentor, the senior monk named Nigrodhakappa, had become extinguished. Then as Vaṅgīsa was in private retreat this thought came to his mind: “Has my mentor become extinguished or not?” Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Vaṅgīsa came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: “Just now, sir, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind. ‘Has my mentor become extinguished or not?’” Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and addressed him in verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="snp2.12:2.1">“I ask the teacher unrivaled in wisdom, <br/>who has cut off all doubts in this very life: <br/>a monk has died at Aggāḷava, who was <br/>well-known, famous, and quenched. </p>
<p id="snp2.12:3.1">Nigrodhakappa was his name; <br/>it was given to that brahmin by you, Blessed One. <br/>He wandered in your honor, yearning for freedom, <br/>energetic, a resolute Seer of Truth. </p>
<p id="snp2.12:4.1">O Sakyan, all-seer, <br/>we all wish to know about that disciple. <br/>Our ears are eager to hear, <br/>for you are the most excellent teacher. </p>
<p id="snp2.12:5.1">Cut off our doubt, declare this to us; <br/>your wisdom is vast, tell us of his quenching! <br/>All-seer, speak among us, <br/>like the thousand-eyed Sakka in the midst of the gods! </p>
<p id="snp2.12:6.1">Whatever ties there are, or paths to delusion, <br/>or things on the side of unknowing, or that are bases of doubt <br/>vanish on reaching a Realized One, <br/>for his eye is the best of all people’s. </p>
<p id="snp2.12:7.1">If no man were ever to disperse corruptions, <br/>like the wind dispersing the clouds, <br/>darkness would shroud the whole world; <br/>not even brilliant men would shine. </p>
<p id="snp2.12:8.1">The wise are bringers of light; <br/>my hero, that is what I think of you. <br/>We’ve come for your discernment and knowledge: <br/>here in this assembly, declare to us about Kappāyana. </p>
<p id="snp2.12:9.1">Swiftly send forth your sweet, sweet voice, <br/>like a goose stretching its neck, gently honking, <br/>lucid-flowing, with lovely tone: <br/>alert, we all listen to you. </p>
<p id="snp2.12:10.1">You have entirely abandoned birth and death; <br/>restrained and pure, I urge you to speak the Dhamma! <br/>For ordinary people have no wish-granter,<a epub:type="noteref" href="#note-31" id="noteref-31" role="doc-noteref">31</a> <br/>but Realized Ones have a comprehensibility-granter.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#note-32" id="noteref-32" role="doc-noteref">32</a> </p>
<p id="snp2.12:11.1">Your answer is definitive, and we will adopt it, <br/>for you have perfect understanding. <br/>We raise our joined palms one last time, <br/>one of unrivaled wisdom, don’t deliberately confuse us. </p>
<p id="snp2.12:12.1">Knowing the noble teaching from top to bottom, <br/>unrivaled hero, don’t deliberately confuse us. <br/>As a man in the baking summer sun would long for water, <br/>I long for your voice, so let the sound rain down. </p>
<p id="snp2.12:13.1">Surely Kappāyana did not lead the spiritual life in vain? <br/>Did he realize quenching, <br/>or did he still have a remnant of defilement? <br/>Let us hear what kind of liberation he had!” </p>
<p id="snp2.12:14.1">“He cut off craving for mind and body in this very life,” <br/><span class="speaker">said the Buddha, </span><br/>“the river of darkness that had long lain within him. <br/>He has entirely crossed over birth and death.” <br/>So declared the Blessed One, the leader of the five. </p>
<p id="snp2.12:15.1">“Now that I have heard your words, <br/>seventh of sages, I am confident. <br/>My question, it seems, was not in vain, <br/>the brahmin did not deceive me. </p>
<p id="snp2.12:16.1">As he said, so he did—<br/>he was a disciple of the Buddha. <br/>He cut the net of death the deceiver, <br/>so extended and strong. </p>
<p id="snp2.12:17.1">Blessed One, Kappāyana saw <br/>the starting point of grasping. <br/>He has indeed gone far beyond <br/>Death’s domain so hard to pass.” </p>

<p id="snp2.14:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then the lay follower Dhammika, together with five hundred lay followers, went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and addressed him in verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="snp2.14:2.1">“I ask you, Gotama, whose wisdom is vast: <br/>what does one do to become a good disciple, <br/>both one who has left the home, <br/>and the lay followers staying at home? </p>
<p id="snp2.14:3.1">For you understand the course and destiny <br/>of the world with all its gods. <br/>There is no equal to you who sees the subtle meaning, <br/>for you are the Buddha most excellent, they say. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:4.1">Having experienced all knowledge, <br/>you explain the teaching out of compassion for beings. <br/>All-seer, you have drawn back the veil, <br/>and immaculate, you shine on the whole world. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:5.1">The dragon king Erāvaṇa, hearing you called ‘Victor’, <br/>came into your presence. <br/>He consulted with you then, having heard your words, <br/>left consoled, saying ‘Excellent!’ </p>
<p id="snp2.14:6.1">And King Kuvera Vessavaṇa also <br/>approached to ask about the teaching. <br/>You also answered him, O wise one, <br/>and hearing you he too was consoled. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:7.1">Those teachers of other paths given to debate, <br/>whether Ājīvakas or Jains, <br/>all fail to overtake you in wisdom, <br/>like a standing man next to a sprinter. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:8.1">Those brahmins given to debate, <br/>some of whom are quite senior, <br/>all end up beholden to you for the meaning, <br/>and others too who think themselves debaters. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:9.1">So subtle and pleasant is the teaching <br/>that is well proclaimed by you, Blessed One. <br/>It’s all we long to hear. So when asked, <br/>O Best of Buddhas, tell us! </p>
<p id="snp2.14:10.1">All these mendicants have gathered, <br/>and the layfolk too are here to listen. <br/>Let them hear the teaching the immaculate one discovered, <br/>like gods listening to the fine words of Vāsava.” </p>
<p id="snp2.14:11.1">“Listen to me, mendicants, I will educate you <br/>in the cleansing teaching; all bear it in mind. <br/>An intelligent person, seeing the meaning, <br/>would adopt the deportment proper to a renunciate.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#note-34" id="noteref-34" role="doc-noteref">34</a> </p>
<p id="snp2.14:12.1">No way would a mendicant go out at the wrong time; <br/>at the right time, they’d walk the village for alms. <br/>For chains bind one who wanders outside the right time, <br/>which is why the Buddhas avoid it. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:13.1">Sights, sounds, tastes, smells, and touches, <br/>which drive beings mad—<br/>dispel desire for such things, <br/>and enter for the morning meal at the right time. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:14.1">After receiving alms for the day, <br/>on returning a mendicant would sit in private alone. <br/>Inwardly reflective, they’d curb their mind <br/>from outside things, keeping themselves collected. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:15.1">Should they converse with a disciple, <br/>with anyone else, or with a mendicant, <br/>they’d bring up only the sublime teaching, <br/>not dividing or blaming. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:16.1">For some contend in debate, <br/>but we praise not those of little wisdom. <br/>In place after place they are bound in chains, <br/>for they send their mind over there far away. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:17.1">Alms, a dwelling, a bed and seat, <br/>and water for rinsing the dust from the cloak—<br/>after hearing the teaching of the Holy One, <br/>a disciple of splendid wisdom would use these after appraisal. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:18.1">That’s why, when it comes to alms and lodgings, <br/>and water for rinsing the dust from the cloak, <br/>a mendicant is unsullied in the midst of these things, <br/>like a droplet on a lotus-leaf. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:19.1">Now I shall tell you the householder’s duty, <br/>doing which one becomes a good disciple. <br/>For one burdened with possessions does not get to realize <br/>the whole of the mendicant’s practice. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:20.1">They’d not kill any creature, nor have them killed, <br/>nor grant permission for others to kill. <br/>They’ve laid aside violence towards all creatures <br/>frail or firm that there are in the world. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:21.1">Next, a disciple would avoid knowingly <br/>taking anything not given at all, <br/>they’d not get others to do it, nor grant them permission to steal; <br/>they’d avoid <em>all</em> theft. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:22.1">A sensible person would avoid the unchaste life, <br/>like a burning pit of coals. <br/>But if unable to remain chaste, <br/>they’d not transgress with another’s partner. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:23.1">In a council or assembly, <br/>or one on one, they would not lie. <br/>They’d not get others to lie, nor grant them permission to lie; <br/>they’d avoid <em>all</em> untruths. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:24.1">A householder espousing this teaching <br/>would not consume liquor or drink. <br/>They’d not get others to drink, nor grant them permission to drink; <br/>knowing that ends in intoxication. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:25.1">For drunken fools do bad things, <br/>and encourage other heedless folk. <br/>Reject this field of demerit, <br/>the maddening, deluding frolic of fools. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:26.1">You shouldn’t kill living creatures, or steal, <br/>or lie, or drink alcohol. <br/>Be celibate, refraining from sex, <br/>and don’t eat at night, the wrong time. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:27.1">Not wearing garlands or applying perfumes, <br/>you should sleep on a low bed, or a mat on the ground. <br/>This is the eight-factored sabbath, they say, <br/>explained by the Buddha, who has gone to suffering’s end. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:28.1">Then having rightly undertaken the sabbath <br/>complete in all its eight factors <br/>on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth of the fortnight, <br/>as well as on the fortnightly special displays, </p>
<p id="snp2.14:29.1">on the morning after the sabbath <br/>a clever person, rejoicing with confident heart, <br/>would distribute food and drink <br/>to the mendicant Saṅgha as is fitting. </p>
<p id="snp2.14:30.1">One should rightfully support one’s parents, <br/>and undertake a legitimate business. <br/>A diligent layperson observing these duties <br/>ascends to the gods called Self-luminous.” </p>

It’s when a mendicant speaks well, not poorly; they speak on the teaching, not against the teaching; they speak pleasantly, not unpleasantly; and they speak truthfully, not falsely. Speech with these four factors is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It’s blameless and is not criticized by sensible people.” That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="snp3.3:3.1">“Good people say that well-spoken words are foremost; <br/>second, speak on the teaching, not against it; <br/>third, speak pleasantly, not unpleasantly; <br/>and fourth, speak truthfully, not falsely.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="snp3.3:4.1">Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said, “I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!” “Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha. Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="snp3.3:5.1">“Speak only such words <br/>that do not hurt yourself <br/>nor harm others; <br/>such speech is truly well spoken. </p>
<p id="snp3.3:6.1">Speak only pleasing words, <br/>words gladly welcomed. <br/>Pleasing words are those <br/>that bring nothing bad to others. </p>
<p id="snp3.3:7.1">Truth itself is the undying word: <br/>this is an eternal truth. <br/>Good people say that the teaching and its meaning <br/>are grounded in the truth. </p>
<p id="snp3.3:8.1">The words spoken by the Buddha <br/>for realizing the sanctuary, extinguishment, <br/>for the attainment of vision, <br/>this really is the best kind of speech.” </p>

<p id="snp3.4:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the Kosalan lands on the bank of the Sundarikā river. Now at that time the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja was serving the sacred flame and performing the fire sacrifice on the bank of the Sundarikā. Then he looked all around the four quarters, wondering, “Now who might eat the leftovers of this offering?” He saw the Buddha meditating at the root of a certain tree with his robe pulled over his head. Taking the leftovers of the offering in his left hand and a pitcher in the right he approached the Buddha. </p>
<p id="snp3.4:2.1">When he heard Sundarikabhāradvāja’s footsteps the Buddha uncovered his head. Sundarikabhāradvāja thought, “This man is shaven, he is shaven!” And he wanted to turn back. But he thought, “Even some brahmins are shaven. Why don’t I go to him and ask about his birth?” Then the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja went up to the Buddha, and said to him, “Sir, in what caste were you born?” </p>
<p id="snp3.4:3.1">Then the Buddha addressed Sundarikabhāradvāja in verse: </p>

<p id="snp3.4:8.1">“On what grounds have hermits and men, <br/>aristocrats and brahmins here in the world <br/>performed so many different sacrifices to the gods?” </p>
<p id="snp3.4:9.1">“During a sacrifice, should a past master, a knowledge master, <br/>receive an oblation, it profits the donor, I say.” </p>
<p id="snp3.4:10.1">“Then clearly my oblation will be profitable,” <br/><span class="speaker">said the brahmin, </span><br/>“since I have met such a knowledge master. <br/>It’s because I’d never met anyone like you <br/>that others ate the sacrificial cake.” </p>

I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” And the brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence.

<p id="snp3.6:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. Now at that time the wanderer Sabhiya had been presented with several questions by a deity who was a former relative, saying: “Sabhiya, you should live the spiritual life with whatever ascetic or brahmin answers these questions.” </p>
<p id="snp3.6:2.1">Then Sabhiya, after learning those questions in the presence of that deity, approached those ascetics and brahmins who led an order and a community, and taught a community, who were well-known and famous religious founders, regarded as holy by many people. That is, Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, Pakudha Kaccāyana, and Ajita Kesakambala. And he asked them those questions, but they were stumped by them. Displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness, they questioned Sabiya in return. </p>
<p id="snp3.6:3.1">Then Sabhiya thought, “Those famous ascetics and brahmins were stumped by my questions. Displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness, they questioned me in return on that matter. Why don’t I return to a lesser life so I can enjoy sensual pleasures?” </p>
<p id="snp3.6:4.1">Then Sabhiya thought, “This ascetic Gotama also leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, regarded as holy by many people. Why don’t I ask him this question?” </p>
<p id="snp3.6:5.1">Then he thought, “Even those ascetics and brahmins who are elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; who are senior, long standing, long gone forth; who lead an order and a community, and teach a community; who are well-known and famous religious founders, regarded as holy by many people—that is Pūraṇa Kassapa and the rest—were stumped by my questions. They displayed annoyance, hate, and bitterness, and even questioned me in return. How can the ascetic Gotama possibly answer my questions, since he is so young in age and newly gone forth?” </p>
<p id="snp3.6:6.1">Then he thought, “An ascetic should not be looked down upon or disparaged because they are young. Though young, the ascetic Gotama has great psychic power and might. Why don’t I ask him this question?” </p>
<p id="snp3.6:7.1">Then Sabhiya set out for Rājagaha. Traveling stage by stage, he came to Rājagaha, the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. He went up to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and addressed the Buddha in verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="snp3.6:8.1">“I’ve come full of  doubts and uncertainties,” <br/><span class="speaker">said Sabhiya, </span><br/>“wishing to ask some questions. <br/>Please solve them for me. <br/>Answer my questions in turn, in accordance with the truth.” </p>
<p id="snp3.6:9.1">“You have come from afar, Sabhiya,” <br/><span class="speaker">said the Buddha, </span><br/>“wishing to ask some questions. <br/>I shall solve them for you, <br/>answering your questions in turn, in accordance with the truth. </p>
<p id="snp3.6:10.1">Ask me your question, Sabhiya, <br/>whatever you want. <br/>I’ll solve each and every <br/>question you have.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="snp3.6:11.1">Then Sabhiya thought, “It’s incredible, it’s amazing! Where those other ascetics and brahmins didn’t even give me a chance, the Buddha has invited me.” Uplifted and elated, full of rapture and happiness, he asked this question. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="snp3.6:12.1">“What must one attain to be called a mendicant?” <br/><span class="speaker">said Sabhiya, </span><br/>“How is one ‘sweet’, how said to be ‘tamed’? <br/>How is one declared to be ‘awakened’? <br/>May the Buddha please answer my question.” </p>
<p id="snp3.6:13.1">“When by the path they have walked themselves,” <br/><span class="speaker">said the Buddha to Sabhiya, </span><br/>“they reach quenching, with doubt overcome; <br/>giving up desire to continue existence or to end it, <br/>their journey complete, their rebirths ended: that is a mendicant. </p>
<p id="snp3.6:14.1">Equanimous towards everything, mindful, <br/>they don’t harm anyone in the world. <br/>An ascetic who has crossed over, unclouded, <br/>not full of themselves, is sweet-natured. </p>
<p id="snp3.6:15.1">Their faculties have been developed <br/>inside and out in the whole world. <br/>Having pierced through this world and the next, <br/>tamed, they bide their time. </p>
<p id="snp3.6:16.1">They have examined the aeons in their entirety,<a epub:type="noteref" href="#note-48" id="noteref-48" role="doc-noteref">48</a> <br/>and both sides of transmigration—passing away and rebirth. <br/>Rid of dust, unblemished, purified: <br/>the one they call ‘awakened’ has attained the end of rebirth.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="snp3.6:17.1">And then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, uplifted and elated, full of rapture and happiness, Sabhiya asked another question: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="snp3.6:18.1">“What must one attain to be called ‘brahmin’?” <br/><span class="speaker">said Sabhiya. </span><br/>“Why is one an ‘ascetic’, and how a ‘bathed initiate’? <br/>How is one declared to be a ‘giant’? <br/>May the Buddha please answer my question.” </p>
<p id="snp3.6:19.1">“Having banished all bad things,” <br/><span class="speaker">said the Buddha to Sabhiya, </span><br/>“immaculate, well-composed, steadfast, <br/>consummate, they’ve left transmigration behind: <br/>such an unattached one is called ‘brahmin’. </p>
<p id="snp3.6:20.1">A peaceful one who has given up good and evil, <br/>stainless, understanding this world and the next, <br/>gone beyond rebirth and death: <br/>such an one is rightly called ‘ascetic’. </p>
<p id="snp3.6:21.1">Having washed off all bad things <br/>inside and out in the whole world, <br/>among gods and humans bound to creations, <br/>the one they call ‘washed’ does not return to creation. </p>
<p id="snp3.6:22.1">They do nothing monstrous at all in the world, <br/>discarding all fetters and bonds, <br/>everywhere not stuck, freed: <br/>such an one is rightly called ‘giant’.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="snp3.6:23.1">And then Sabhiya asked another question: </p>

<blockquote class="gatha">

<p id="snp3.6:52.1">Then the wanderer Sabhiya bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet and said, “Excellent, sir! Excellent! … I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” </p>
<p id="snp3.6:53.1">“Sabhiya, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation.

<h2 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">Snp 3.7</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">With Sela </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Selasutta</span></h2>
<p id="snp3.7:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Northern Āpaṇas together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Northern Āpaṇas named Āpaṇa. The matted-hair ascetic Keṇiya heard: “It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Āpaṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.” </p>
<p id="snp3.7:2.1">So Keṇiya approached the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk. Then he said to the Buddha, “Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?” When he said this, the Buddha said to him, “The Saṅgha is large, Keṇiya; there are 1,250 mendicants. And you are devoted to the brahmins.” </p>
<p id="snp3.7:3.1">For a second time, Keṇiya asked the Buddha to accept a meal offering. “Never mind that the Saṅgha is large, with 1,250 mendicants, and that I am devoted to the brahmins. Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?” And for a second time, the Buddha gave the same reply. </p>
<p id="snp3.7:4.1">For a third time, Keṇiya asked the Buddha to accept a meal offering. “Never mind that the Saṅgha is large, with 1,250 mendicants, and that I am devoted to the brahmins. Would Master Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me?” The Buddha consented in silence. Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Keṇiya got up from his seat and went to his own hermitage. There he addressed his friends and colleagues, relatives and family members, “My friends and colleagues, relatives and family members: please listen! The ascetic Gotama together with the mendicant Saṅgha has been invited by me for tomorrow’s meal. Please help me with the preparations.” “Yes, sir,” they replied. Some dug ovens, some chopped wood, some washed dishes, some set out a water jar, and some spread out seats. Meanwhile, Keṇiya set up the pavilion himself. </p>
<p id="snp3.7:5.1">Now at that time the brahmin Sela was residing in Āpaṇa. He had mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. He knew philology and grammar, and was well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man. And he was teaching three hundred students to recite the hymns. </p>
<p id="snp3.7:6.1">And at that time Keṇiya was devoted to Sela. Then Sela, while going for a walk escorted by the three hundred students, approached Keṇiya’s hermitage. He saw the preparations going on, and said to Keṇiya, “Keṇiya, is your son or daughter being married? Or are you setting up a big sacrifice? Or has King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha been invited for tomorrow’s meal?” </p>
<p id="snp3.7:7.1">“There is no marriage, Sela, and the king is not coming. Rather, I am setting up a big sacrifice. The ascetic Gotama has arrived at Āpaṇa, together with a large Saṅgha of 1,250 mendicants. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has been invited by me for tomorrow’s meal together with the mendicant Saṅgha.” “Mister Keṇiya, did you say ‘the awakened one’?” “I said ‘the awakened one’.” “Mister Keṇiya, did you say ‘the awakened one’?” “I said ‘the awakened one’.” </p>
<p id="snp3.7:8.1">Then Sela thought, “It’s hard to even find the word ‘awakened one’ in the world. The thirty-two marks of a great man have been handed down in our hymns. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other. If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures. He has the following seven treasures: the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure. He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword. But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world. “But Keṇiya, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?” </p>
<p id="snp3.7:9.1">When he said this, Keṇiya pointed with his right arm and said, “There, Mister Sela, at that line of blue forest.” Then Sela, together with his students, approached the Buddha. He said to his students, “Come quietly, gentlemen, tread gently. For the Buddhas are intimidating, like a lion living alone. When I’m consulting with the ascetic Gotama, don’t interrupt. Wait until I’ve finished speaking.” </p>
<p id="snp3.7:10.1">Then Sela went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. and scrutinized the Buddha’s body for the thirty-two marks of a great man. He saw all of them except for two, which he had doubts about: whether the private parts were covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue. </p>
<p id="snp3.7:11.1">Then it occurred to the Buddha, “Sela sees all the marks except for two, which he has doubts about: whether the private parts are covered in a foreskin, and the largeness of the tongue.” The Buddha used his psychic power to will that Sela would see his private parts covered in a foreskin. And he stuck out his tongue and stroked back and forth on his ear holes and nostrils, and covered his entire forehead with his tongue. </p>
<p id="snp3.7:12.1">Then Sela thought, “The ascetic Gotama possesses the thirty-two marks completely, lacking none. But I don’t know whether or not he is an awakened one. I have heard that brahmins of the past who were elderly and senior, the teachers of teachers, said, ‘Those who are perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas reveal themselves when praised.’ Why don’t I extoll him in his presence with fitting verses?” Then Sela extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="snp3.7:13.1">“O Blessed One, your body’s perfect, <br/>you’re radiant, handsome, lovely to behold; <br/>golden colored, <br/>with teeth so white; you’re strong. </p>
<p id="snp3.7:14.1">The characteristics <br/>of a handsome man, <br/>the marks of a great man, <br/>are all found on your body. </p>
<p id="snp3.7:15.1">Your eyes are clear, your face is fair, <br/>you’re formidable, upright, majestic. <br/>In the midst of the Saṅgha of ascetics, <br/>you shine like the sun. </p>
<p id="snp3.7:16.1">You’re a mendicant fine to see, <br/>with skin of golden sheen. <br/>But with such excellent appearance, <br/>what do you want with the ascetic life? </p>
<p id="snp3.7:17.1">You’re fit to be a king, <br/>a wheel-turning monarch, chief of charioteers, <br/>victorious in the four quarters, <br/>lord of all India. </p>
<p id="snp3.7:18.1">Aristocrats, nobles, and kings <br/>ought follow your rule. <br/>Gotama, you should reign <br/>as king of kings, lord of men!” </p>
<p id="snp3.7:19.1">“I am a king, Sela”, <br/><span class="speaker">said the Buddha, </span><br/>“the supreme king of the teaching. <br/>By the teaching I roll forth the wheel <br/>which cannot be rolled back.” </p>
<p id="snp3.7:20.1">“You claim to be awakened,” <br/><span class="speaker">said Sela the brahmin, </span><br/>“the supreme king of the teaching. <br/>‘I roll forth the teaching’: <br/>so you say, Gotama. </p>
<p id="snp3.7:21.1">Then who is your general, <br/>the disciple who follows the Teacher’s way? <br/>Who keeps rolling the wheel <br/>of the teaching you rolled forth?” </p>
<p id="snp3.7:22.1">“By me the wheel was rolled forth,” <br/><span class="speaker">said the Buddha, </span><br/>“the supreme wheel of the teaching. <br/>Sāriputta, taking after the Realized One, <br/>keeps it rolling on. </p>
<p id="snp3.7:23.1">I have known what should be known, <br/>and developed what should be developed, <br/>and given up what should be given up: <br/>and so, brahmin, I am a Buddha. </p>
<p id="snp3.7:24.1">Dispel your doubt in me—<br/>make up your mind, brahmin! <br/>The sight of a Buddha <br/>is hard to find again. </p>
<p id="snp3.7:25.1">I am a Buddha, brahmin, <br/>the supreme surgeon, <br/>one of those whose appearance in the world <br/>is hard to find again. </p>
<p id="snp3.7:26.1">Holy, unequaled, <br/>crusher of Māra’s army; <br/>having subdued all my opponents, <br/>I rejoice, fearing nothing from any quarter.” </p>
<p id="snp3.7:27.1">“Pay heed, sirs, to what <br/>is spoken by the seer. <br/>The surgeon, the great hero, <br/>roars like a lion in the jungle. </p>
<p id="snp3.7:28.1">Holy, unequaled, <br/>crusher of Māra’s army; <br/>who would not be inspired by him, <br/>even one whose nature is dark? </p>
<p id="snp3.7:29.1">Those who wish may follow me; <br/>those who don’t may go. <br/>Right here, I’ll go forth in his presence, <br/>the one of such splendid wisdom.” </p>
<p id="snp3.7:30.1">“Sir, if you like <br/>in the teaching of the Buddha, <br/>we’ll also go forth in his presence, <br/>the one of such splendid wisdom.” </p>
<p id="snp3.7:31.1">“These three hundred brahmins <br/>with joined palms held up, ask: <br/>‘May we lead the spiritual life <br/>in your presence, Blessed One?’” </p>
<p id="snp3.7:32.1">“The spiritual life is well explained,” <br/><span class="speaker">said the Buddha, </span><br/>“visible in this very life, immediately effective. <br/>Here the going forth isn’t in vain <br/>for one who trains with diligence.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="snp3.7:33.1">And the brahmin Sela together with his assembly received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. And when the night had passed Keṇiya had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, “Itʼs time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.” Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Keṇiya’s hermitage, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. </p>
<p id="snp3.7:34.1">Then Keṇiya served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods. When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Keṇiya took a low seat and sat to one side. The Buddha expressed his appreciation with these verses: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="snp3.7:35.1">“The foremost of sacrifices is offering to the sacred flame; <br/>the Gāyatrī Mantra is the foremost of poetic meters; <br/>of humans, the king is the foremost; <br/>the ocean’s the foremost of rivers; </p>
<p id="snp3.7:36.1">the foremost of stars is the moon; <br/>the sun is the foremost of lights; <br/>for those who sacrifice seeking merit, <br/>the Saṅgha is the foremost.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="snp3.7:37.1">When the Buddha had expressed his appreciation to Keṇiya the matted-hair ascetic with these verses, he got up from his seat and left. Then Venerable Sela and his assembly, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. They lived having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. And Venerable Sela together with his assembly became perfected. </p>
<p id="snp3.7:38.1">Then Sela with his assembly went to see the Buddha. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="snp3.7:39.1">“This is the eighth day since <br/>we went for refuge, O seer. <br/>In these seven days, Blessed One, <br/>we’ve become tamed in your teaching. </p>
<p id="snp3.7:40.1">You are the Buddha, you are the Teacher, <br/>you are the sage who has overcome Māra; <br/>you have cut off the underlying tendencies, <br/>you’ve crossed over, and you bring humanity across. </p>
<p id="snp3.7:41.1">You have transcended attachments, <br/>your defilements are shattered; <br/>you are a lion, free of grasping, <br/>with fear and dread given up. </p>
<p id="snp3.7:42.1">These three hundred mendicants <br/>stand with joined palms raised. <br/>Stretch out your feet, great hero: <br/>let these giants bow to the Teacher.” </p>

Now at that time several very well-known well-to-do brahmins were residing in Icchānaṅgala. They included the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jāṇussoṇi, Todeyya, and others. Then as the brahmin students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began to discuss the question: “How do you become a brahmin?” </p>
<p id="snp3.9:2.1">Bhāradvāja said this: “When you’re well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation—then you’re a brahmin.” </p>
<p id="snp3.9:3.1">Vāseṭṭha said this: “When you’re ethical and accomplished in doing your duties—then you’re a brahmin.” But neither was able to persuade the other. </p>
<p id="snp3.9:4.1">So Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvāja, “Master Bhāradvāja, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ Come, let’s go to see him and ask him about this matter. As he answers, so we’ll remember it.” “Yes, sir,” replied Bhāradvāja. </p>
<p id="snp3.9:5.1">So they went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side, and Vāseṭṭha addressed the Buddha in verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="snp3.9:6.1">“We’re both authorized masters <br/>of the three Vedas. <br/>I’m a student of Pokkharasāti, <br/>and he of Tārukkha. </p>

<p id="snp3.9:8.1">We have a dispute <br/>regarding the question of ancestry. <br/>For Bhāradvāja says that <br/>one is a brahmin due to birth, <br/>but I declare it’s because of one’s actions. <br/>Oh seer, know this as our debate. </p>
<p id="snp3.9:9.1">Since neither of us was able <br/>to convince the other, <br/>we’ve come to ask you, sir, <br/>renowned as the awakened one. </p>
<p id="snp3.9:10.1">As people honor with joined palms <br/>the moon on the cusp of waxing, <br/>bowing, they revere <br/>Gotama in the world. </p>
<p id="snp3.9:11.1">We ask this of Gotama, <br/>the eye arisen in the world: <br/>is one a brahmin due to birth, <br/>or else because of actions? <br/>We don’t know, please tell us, <br/>so we can recognize a brahmin.” </p>
<p id="snp3.9:12.1">“I shall explain to you,” <br/><span class="speaker">said the Buddha, </span><br/>“accurately and in sequence, <br/>the taxonomy of living creatures, <br/>for species are indeed diverse. </p>

<h2 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">Snp 3.10</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">With Kokālika </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Kokālikasutta</span></h2>
<p id="snp3.10:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then the mendicant Kokālika went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.” </p>
<p id="snp3.10:2.1">When this was said, the Buddha said to Kokālika, “Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.” </p>
<p id="snp3.10:3.1">For a second time … For a third time Kokālika said to the Buddha, “Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have wicked desires. They’ve fallen under the sway of wicked desires.” For a third time, the Buddha said to Kokālika, “Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.” </p>
<p id="snp3.10:4.1">Then Kokālika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. Not long after he left his body erupted with boils the size of mustard seeds. The boils grew to the size of mung beans, then chickpeas, then jujube seeds, then jujubes, then myrobalans, then unripe wood apples, then ripe wood apples. Finally they burst open, and pus and blood oozed out. Then the mendicant Kokālika died of that illness. He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna. </p>
<p id="snp3.10:5.1">Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, “Sir, the mendicant Kokālika has passed away. He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.” That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there. </p>
<p id="snp3.10:6.1">Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened. </p>
<p id="snp3.10:7.1">When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha, “Sir, how long is the life span in the Pink Lotus hell?” “It’s long, mendicant. It’s not easy to calculate how many years, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts.” “But sir, is it possible to give a simile?” “It’s possible,” said the Buddha. </p>
<p id="snp3.10:8.1">“Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed. And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed from it. By this means the Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell. Now, twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Nirabbuda hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Nirabbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Ababa hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Ababa hell equal one lifetime in the Aṭaṭa hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Aṭaṭa hell equal one lifetime in the Ahaha hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Ahaha hell equal one lifetime in the Yellow Lotus hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Yellow Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Sweet-Smelling hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Sweet-Smelling hell equal one lifetime in the Blue Water Lily hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Blue Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the White Lotus hell. Twenty lifetimes in the White Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Pink Lotus hell. The mendicant Kokālika has been reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.” That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>

Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks. Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were so very silent. He addressed them: </p>
<p id="snp3.12:2.1">“Suppose, mendicants, they questioned you thus: ‘There are skillful teachings that are noble, emancipating, and lead to awakening.

<p id="snp4.15:11.1">Greed, I say, is the great flood, <br/>and longing is the current—<br/>the basis, the compulsion, <br/>the swamp of sensuality so hard to get past. </p>

<p id="snp4.16:3.1">On behalf of the many here still bound, <br/>I have come in need with a question <br/>to that Buddha, unattached and impartial, <br/>free of deceit, come to lead a community. </p>
<p id="snp4.16:4.1">Suppose a mendicant who loathes attachment <br/>frequents a lonely lodging—<br/>the root of a tree, a charnel ground, <br/>on mountains, or in caves. </p>
<p id="snp4.16:5.1">In these many different lodgings, <br/>how many dangers are there <br/>at which a mendicant in their silent lodging <br/>ought not tremble?<a epub:type="noteref" href="#note-186" id="noteref-186" role="doc-noteref">186</a> </p>
<p id="snp4.16:6.1">On their journey to the untrodden place, <br/>how many adversities are there in the world <br/>that must they overcome <br/>in their remote lodging? </p>
<p id="snp4.16:7.1">What ways of speech should they have? <br/>Where should they go for alms? <br/>What precepts and vows <br/>should a resolute mendicant uphold? </p>
<p id="snp4.16:8.1">Having undertaken what training, <br/>unified, alert, and mindful, <br/>would they purge their own stains, <br/>like a smith smelting silver?” </p>
<p id="snp4.16:9.1">“If one who loathes attachment frequents a lonely lodging,” <br/><span class="speaker">said the Buddha to Sāriputta, </span><br/>“in their search for awakening—as accords with the teaching—<br/>I shall tell you, as I understand it, <br/>what is comfortable for them. </p>
<p id="snp4.16:10.1">A wise one, a mindful mendicant living on the periphery <br/>should not be afraid of five perils:<a epub:type="noteref" href="#note-187" id="noteref-187" role="doc-noteref">187</a> <br/>flies, mosquitoes, snakes, <br/>human contact, or four-legged creatures. </p>
<p id="snp4.16:11.1">Nor should they fear followers of other teachings, <br/>even having seen the many threats they pose. <br/>And then one seeking the good <br/>should overcome any other adversities. </p>
<p id="snp4.16:12.1">Afflicted by illness and hunger, <br/>they should endure cold and excessive heat. <br/>Though afflicted by many such things, the homeless one <br/>should exert energy, firmly striving. </p>
<p id="snp4.16:13.1">They must not steal or lie; <br/>and should touch creatures firm or frail with love. <br/>If they notice any clouding of the mind, <br/>they should dispel it as Māra’s ally. </p>
<p id="snp4.16:14.1">They must not fall under the sway of anger or arrogance; <br/>having dug them out by the root, they would stand firm. <br/>Then, withstanding likes and dislikes, <br/>they would overcome. </p>
<p id="snp4.16:15.1">Putting wisdom in the foremost place, rejoicing in goodness, <br/>they would put an end to those adversities. <br/>They’d vanquish discontent in their remote lodging. <br/>And they’d vanquish the four lamentations: </p>
<p id="snp4.16:16.1">‘What will I eat? Where will I eat? <br/>Oh, I slept badly! Where will I sleep?’ <br/>The trainee, the homeless migrant, <br/>would dispel these lamentable thoughts. </p>
<p id="snp4.16:17.1">Receiving food and clothes in due season, <br/>they would know moderation for the sake of contentment. <br/>Guarded in these things, walking restrained in the village, <br/>they wouldn’t speak harshly even when provoked. </p>
<p id="snp4.16:18.1">Eyes downcast, not footloose, <br/>devoted to absorption, they’d be very wakeful.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#note-188" id="noteref-188" role="doc-noteref">188</a> <br/>Grounded in equanimity, serene, <br/>they should cut off worrisome habits of thought. </p>
<p id="snp4.16:19.1">A mindful one should welcome repoach, <br/>breaking up hard-heartedness towards their spiritual companions. <br/>They may utter skillful speech, but not for too long, <br/>and they shouldn’t provoke people to blame. </p>
<p id="snp4.16:20.1">And there are five more taints in the world, <br/>for the removal of which the mindful one should train, <br/>vanquishing desire for sights, <br/>sounds, flavors, smells, and touches. </p>

<p id="snp5.1:8.1">“If, good sir, you do not <br/>give me what I ask, <br/>then on the seventh day, <br/>let your head explode in seven!” </p>
<p id="snp5.1:9.1">After performing a ritual, <br/>that charlatan uttered his dreadful curse. <br/>When he heard these words, <br/>Bāvari became distressed. </p>
<p id="snp5.1:10.1">Not eating, he grew emaciated, <br/>stricken by the dart of sorrow. <br/>And in such a state of mind, <br/>he could not enjoy absorption. </p>

<p id="snp5.1:14.1">“I too do not know that, <br/>I have no knowledge in that matter. <br/>When it comes to heads or head-splitting, <br/>it is the Victors who have vision.” </p>

<p id="snp5.1:17.1">For he, brahmin, is the Awakened One! <br/>He has gone beyond all things; <br/>he has attained to all knowledge and power; <br/>he is the seer into all things, <br/>he has attained the end of all deeds; <br/>he is freed with the ending of attachments. </p>
<p id="snp5.1:18.1">That Buddha, the Blessed One in the world, <br/>the Seer, teaches Dhamma. <br/>Go to him and ask—<br/>he will answer you.” </p>
<p id="snp5.1:19.1">When he heard the word “Buddha”, <br/>Bāvari was elated. <br/>His sorrow faded, <br/>and he was filled to brimming with joy. </p>
<p id="snp5.1:20.1">Uplifted, elated, and inspired, <br/>Bāvari questioned that goddess: <br/>“But in what village or town, <br/>or in what land is the protector of the world, <br/>where we may go and pay respects <br/>to the Awakened One, best of men?” </p>
<p id="snp5.1:21.1">“Near Sāvatthī, the home of the Kosalans, is the Victor<a epub:type="noteref" href="#note-195" id="noteref-195" role="doc-noteref">195</a> <br/>abounding in wisdom, vast in intelligence. <br/>That Sakyan is indefatigable, free of defilements, a bull among men:<a epub:type="noteref" href="#note-196" id="noteref-196" role="doc-noteref">196</a> <br/>he understands head-splitting. </p>

<p id="snp5.1:24.1">“Brahmin, how exactly are we to know <br/>the Buddha when we see him? <br/>We don’t know, please tell us, <br/>so we can recognize him.” </p>
<p id="snp5.1:25.1">“The marks of a great man <br/>have been handed down in our hymns. <br/>Thirty-two have been described, <br/>complete and in order. </p>
<p id="snp5.1:26.1">One upon whose body is found <br/>these marks of a great man <br/>has two possible destinies, <br/>there is no third. </p>
<p id="snp5.1:27.1">If he stays at home, <br/>having conquered this land <br/>without rod or sword, <br/>he shall govern by principle. </p>
<p id="snp5.1:28.1">But if he goes forth <br/>from the lay life to homelessness, <br/>he becomes an Awakened One, a perfected one, <br/>with veil drawn back, supreme. </p>
<p id="snp5.1:29.1">Ask him about my birth, clan, and marks, <br/>my hymns and students; and further, <br/>about heads and head-splitting—<br/>but do so only in your mind! </p>
<p id="snp5.1:30.1">If he is the Buddha <br/>of unobstructed vision, <br/>he will answer with his voice <br/>the questions in your mind.” </p>
<p id="snp5.1:31.1">Sixteen brahmin pupils <br/>heard what Bāvari said: <br/>Ajita, Tissametteyya, <br/>Puṇṇaka and Mettagū, </p>

<p id="snp5.1:34.1">Each of them had their own following, <br/>they were renowned the whole world over. <br/>Those wise ones, meditators who love absorption,<a epub:type="noteref" href="#note-197" id="noteref-197" role="doc-noteref">197</a> <br/>were redolent with the potential of their past deeds.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#note-198" id="noteref-198" role="doc-noteref">198</a> </p>
<p id="snp5.1:35.1">Having bowed to Bāvari, <br/>and circled him to his right, <br/>they set out for the north, <br/>with their dreadlocks and hides. </p>
<p id="snp5.1:36.1">First to Patiṭṭhāna of Aḷaka, <br/>then on to the city of Mahissati;<a epub:type="noteref" href="#note-199" id="noteref-199" role="doc-noteref">199</a> <br/>to Ujjenī and Gonaddhā, <br/>and Vedisa, and Vanasa. </p>
<p id="snp5.1:37.1">Then to Kosambi and Sāketa, <br/>and the supreme city of Sāvatthī; <br/>on they went to Setavyā and Kapilavatthu,<a epub:type="noteref" href="#note-200" id="noteref-200" role="doc-noteref">200</a> <br/>and the homestead at Kusinārā.<a epub:type="noteref" href="#note-201" id="noteref-201" role="doc-noteref">201</a> </p>
<p id="snp5.1:38.1">To Pāvā they went, and Bhoganagara, <br/>and on to Vesālī and the Magadhan city. <br/>Finally they reached the Pāsāṇaka shrine, <br/>fair and delightful. </p>
<p id="snp5.1:39.1">Like a thirsty person to cool water, <br/>like a merchant to great profit, <br/>like a heat-struck person to shade, <br/>they quickly climbed the mountain. </p>
<p id="snp5.1:40.1">At that time the Buddha <br/>at the fore of the mendicant Saṅgha, <br/>was teaching the mendicants the Dhamma, <br/>like a lion roaring in the jungle. </p>
<p id="snp5.1:41.1">Ajita saw the Buddha, <br/>like the sun shining with a hundred rays, <br/>like the moon on the fifteenth day <br/>when it has come into its fullness. </p>
<p id="snp5.1:42.1">Then he saw his body, <br/>complete in all features. <br/>Thrilled, he stood to one side <br/>and asked this question in his mind. </p>
<p id="snp5.1:43.1">“Speak about the brahmin’s birth; <br/>of his clan; and his own marks; <br/>what hymns is he proficient in; <br/>and how many he teaches.” </p>
<p id="snp5.1:44.1">“His age is a hundred and twenty. <br/>By clan he is a Bāvari. <br/>There are three marks on his body. <br/>He is a master of the three Vedas, </p>
<p id="snp5.1:45.1">the teachings on the marks, the testaments, <br/>the vocabularies, and the rituals. <br/>He teaches five hundred, <br/>and has reached proficiency in his own teaching.” </p>
<p id="snp5.1:46.1">“O supreme person, cutter of craving, <br/>please reveal in detail <br/>Bāvari’s marks—<br/>let us doubt no longer!” </p>
<p id="snp5.1:47.1">“He can cover his face with his tongue; <br/>there is a tuft of hair between his eyebrows; <br/>his private parts are concealed in a foreskin: <br/>know them as this, young man.” </p>
<p id="snp5.1:48.1">Hearing the answers <br/>without having heard any questions, <br/>all the people, inspired, <br/>with joined palms, wondered: </p>
<p id="snp5.1:49.1">“Who is it that asked a question with their mind? <br/>Was it a god or Brahmā? <br/>Or Indra, Sujā’s husband? <br/>To whom does the Buddha reply?” </p>
<p id="snp5.1:50.1">“Bāvari asks <br/>about heads and head-splitting. <br/>May the Buddha please answer, <br/>and so, O hermit, dispel our doubt.” </p>
<p id="snp5.1:51.1">“Know ignorance as the head, <br/>and knowledge as the head-splitter, <br/>when joined with faith, mindfulness, and immersion, <br/>and enthusiasm and energy.” </p>
<p id="snp5.1:52.1">At that, the brahmin student, <br/>full of inspiration, <br/>arranged his antelope-skin cloak over one shoulder, <br/>and fell with his head to the Buddha’s feet. </p>
<p id="snp5.1:53.1">“Good sir, the brahmin Bāvari <br/>together with his pupils, <br/>elated and happy, <br/>bows to your feet, O seer!” </p>
<p id="snp5.1:54.1">“May the brahmin Bāvari be happy, <br/>together with his pupils. <br/>And may you, too, be happy! <br/>May you live long, young man. </p>
<p id="snp5.1:55.1">To Bāvari and you all <br/>I grant the opportunity to clear up all doubt. <br/>Please ask <br/>whatever you want.” </p>
<p id="snp5.1:56.1">Granted the opportunity by the Buddha, <br/>they sat down with joined palms. <br/>Ajita asked the Realized One <br/>the first question right there. </p>

<p id="snp5.18:1.1">This was said by the Buddha while staying in the land of the Magadhans at the Pāsāṇake shrine. When requested by the sixteen brahmin devotees, he answered their questions one by one. If you understand the meaning and the teaching of each of these questions, and practice accordingly, you may go right to the far shore of old age and death. These teachings are said to lead to the far shore, which is why the name of this exposition of the teaching is “The Way to the Beyond”. </p>

<h1>Endnotes</h1>

<li epub:type="endnote" id="note-1">
<p>Both Bodhi and Norman implicitly accept the commentarial reading here, i.e. that this refers to “wrong thoughts”. However the identical line at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/ud6.7/en/sujato#4.1">Ud 6.7:4.1</a> clearly refers to jhāna. Both also follow the commentary in reading <i lang="pi" translate="no">vidhūpitā</i> as “burning up”, but <i lang="pi" translate="no">vidhūpa</i> refers to clearing the mist, smoke, or incense.  <a epub:type="backlink" href="#noteref-1" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li epub:type="endnote" id="note-2">
<p>Bodhi, Norman, and Thanissaro all render <i lang="pi" translate="no">vitatha</i> as “unreal”. Normally it’s used in the context of “true” speech or the “reality” or “unerringness” of say dependent origination. To say the whole world is “unreal” seems overly idealistic for early Buddhism, so I translate in accord with the apparent sense.  <a epub:type="backlink" href="#noteref-2" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li epub:type="endnote" id="note-3">
<p>Norman points out that this verse is not a proper response to the previous and suggests that a verse has been lost. I agree, but I disagree there is a contradiction in the sense. Rather, the verse tells a story over time. I translate to bring out the meaning.  <a epub:type="backlink" href="#noteref-3" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li epub:type="endnote" id="note-4">
<p>I’m not convinced by the commentary’s “not separated”. It doesn’t seem to occur in this meaning elsewhere, and lacks a connection with the opening line. Surely the whole verse must be about the children, which requires that there be a comparison made with the first line. The point is, I think, that the children follow the father and have become self-sufficient. This also echoes better with the Buddha’s response.  <a epub:type="backlink" href="#noteref-4" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li epub:type="endnote" id="note-5">
<p>Norman and Bodhi read the middle form <i lang="pi" translate="no">carāmase</i> as imperative, apparently, but that doesn’t make sense to me; in this context optative would make more sense, but I am not aware of this form. Rather, I take it as the present indicative in the sense of definite future.  <a epub:type="backlink" href="#noteref-5" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>
</li>
<li epub:type="endnote" id="note-6">
<p>The exact nuance of this line is hard to pin down. Later Pali texts equate <i lang="pi" translate="no">abhilāpa</i> with “naming”, but it doesn’t seem to occur in any early texts with this sense. However <i lang="pi" translate="no">lapanā</i> is used in the sense of “flattery” in eg. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/mn117/en/sujato#29">MN 117:29</a>.  <a epub:type="backlink" href="#noteref-6" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>

<p><i lang="pi" translate="no">Sakkhipuṭṭho</i> is only elsewhere used in the context of being asked to bear witness in court.

<p>The commentary, followed by Norman, Bodhi, and Ñāṇadīpa, all take <i lang="pi" translate="no">pamāya</i> here in the sense of “crushed” (Sanskrit: <i lang="pi" translate="no">pramṛṇati</i>). However, <i lang="pi" translate="no">pamāya</i> occurs at <a href="https://suttacentral.net/snp4.12/en/sujato#17.1">Snp 4.12:17.1</a>, where, being beside <i lang="pi" translate="no">vinicchaye</i> (“judge, assess”), it is clearly an absolutive of <i lang="pi" translate="no">pamiṇāti</i> “having measured”. Here too it sits beside a word (<i lang="pi" translate="no">saṅkhāya</i>) having the sense to reckon or calculate. In the simile of rebirth and the field, the “seed” is consciousness, which belonging to the first noble truth is not “crushed” but “fully known”. If the seeds are already “crushed” then choosing not to water them (in the next line) is a tad redundant.  <a epub:type="backlink" href="#noteref-21" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>

<p>I’m not entirely convinced that <i lang="pi" translate="no">ganthetvā</i> means “composed” here.

The point, in line with the previous and succeeding verses, is that the Buddha explains things in a way that makes them clear.

<p>The meaning of these lines is quite obscure. The <i lang="pi" translate="no">muñja</i> was used for the brahmin’s girdle, and as such became an epithet of Vishnu and Shiva.

It is not that nothing <em>has ever</em> been taken up or put down, but that they are no longer actively engaging in taking up and putting down.  <a epub:type="backlink" href="#noteref-212" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>

<p>The Niddesa explains, in line with the Buddha’s answer, that the question is about the kind of knowledge needed to guide one with such an attainment. Thus it must be dative, not genitive.  <a epub:type="backlink" href="#noteref-216" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>

<p>Read <i lang="pi" translate="no">’dhimuttaṁ</i> per Niddesa, see discussion in Bodhi. The sense is the same as eg. an4.125.

<p>To <i lang="pi" translate="no">anugāyati</i> is to keep on reciting, as the brahmins did with their hymns descended from seers of old (as eg. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an5.192/en/sujato#3.1">AN 5.192:3.1</a>). Here, Piṅgiya, as an experienced Vedic reciter himself, announces that he will keep the this teaching alive in just the same way. This is perhaps the most explicit evidence for a direct historical link between the oral recitation methods of the brahmins and the Buddhists.  <a epub:type="backlink" href="#noteref-218" role="doc-backlink">↩</a></p>

<h2>The Translator</h2>
<p><span property="dc:creator">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> was born as Anthony Aidan Best on <span class="dc:date">4/11/1966</span> in Perth, Western Australia. He grew up in the pleasant suburbs of Mt Lawley and Attadale alongside his sister Nicola, who was the good child. His mother, Margaret Lorraine Huntsman née Pinder, said “he’ll either be a priest or a poet”, while his father, Anthony Thomas Best, advised him to “never do anything for money”. He attended Aquinas College, a Catholic school, where he decided to become an atheist. At the University of WA he studied philosophy, aiming to learn what he wanted to do with his life. Finding that what he wanted to do was play guitar, he dropped out. His main band was named Martha’s Vineyard, which achieved modest success in the indie circuit. Then it broke up, because everyone thought they personally were reason for the success, which, oddly enough, turns out not to have been the case. </p>
<p>A seemingly random encounter with a roadside joey took him to Thailand, where he entered his first meditation retreat at Wat Ram Poeng, Chieng Mai in 1992. He decided to devote himself to the Buddha’s path, and took full ordination in Wat Pa Nanachat in 1994, where his teachers were Ajahn Pasanno and Ajahn Jayasaro. In 1997 he returned to Perth to study with Ajahn Brahm at Bodhinyana Monastery. </p>
<p>He spent several years practicing in seclusion in Malaysia and Thailand before establishing Santi Forest Monastery in Bundanoon, NSW, in 2003. There he was instrumental in supporting the establishment of the Theravada bhikkhuni order in Australia and advocating for women’s rights. He continues to teach in Australia and globally, with a special concern for the moral implications of climate change and other forms of environmental destruction. He has published a series of books of original and groundbreaking research on early Buddhism. </p>
<p>In 2005 he founded SuttaCentral together with Rod Bucknell and John Kelly. In 2015, seeing the need for a complete, accurate, plain English translation of the Pali texts, he undertook the task, spending nearly three years in isolation on the isle of Qi Mei off the coast of the nation of Taiwan. He completed the four main Nikāyas in 2018, and the early books of the Khuddaka Nikāya were complete by 2021. All this work is dedicated to the public domain and is entirely free of copyright encumbrance. </p>
<p>In 2019 he returned to Sydney where, together with Bhikkhu Akaliko, he established Lokanta Vihara (The Monastery at the End of the World). </p>
<h2>Creation Process</h2>
<p>Translated from the Pali. Primary source was the Mahāsaṅgīti edition, with reference to several English translations, especially those of K.R. Norman, Bhikkhu Bodhi, and Bhikkhu Ñāṇadīpa.</p>
<h2>The Translation</h2>
<p>This translation aims to retain the directness and urgency of the Suttanipāta. The Suttanipāta includes verses from the earliest and latest periods within the period encompassed by the early texts, and so it covers a challenging variety of styles and themes, by turns fierce, devotional, or incisive. In several portions, most notably the Aṭṭhakavagga, there are a range of highly specific usages that demand careful attention.</p>
<h2>About SuttaCentral</h2>
<p>SuttaCentral publishes early Buddhist texts. Since 2005 we have provided root texts in Pali, Chinese, Sanskrit, Tibetan, and other languages, parallels between these texts, and translations in many modern languages. We build on the work of generations of scholars, and offer our contribution freely.</p>
<p>SuttaCentral is driven by volunteer contributions, and in addition we employ professional developers. We offer a sponsorship program for high quality translations from the original languages. Financial support for SuttaCentral is handled by the SuttaCentral Development Trust, a charitable trust registered in Australia.</p>
<h2>About Bilara</h2>
<p>“Bilara” means “cat” in Pali, and it is the name of our Computer Assisted Translation (CAT) software. Bilara is a web app that enables translators to translate early Buddhist texts into their own language. These translations are published on SuttaCentral with the root text and translation side by side.</p>
<h2>About SuttaCentral Editions</h2>
<p>The SuttaCentral Editions project makes high quality books from selected Bilara translations. These are published in formats including HTML, EPUB, PDF, and print.</p>
<p>If you want to print any of our Editions, please let us know and we will help prepare a file to your specifications.</p>
