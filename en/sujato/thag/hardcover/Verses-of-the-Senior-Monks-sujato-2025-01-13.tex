Since 2005 SuttaCentral has provided access to the texts, translations, and parallels of early Buddhist texts. In 2018 we started creating and publishing our translations of these seminal spiritual classics. The “Editions” series now makes selected translations available as books in various forms, including print, PDF, and EPUB.

Editions are selected from our most complete, well-crafted, and reliable translations. They aim to bring these texts to a wider audience in forms that reward mindful reading. Care is taken with every detail of the production, and we aim to meet or exceed professional best standards in every way. These are the core scriptures underlying the entire Buddhist tradition, and we believe that they deserve to be preserved and made available in the highest quality without compromise.

SuttaCentral is a charitable organization. Our work is accomplished by volunteers and through the generosity of our donors. Everything we create is offered to all of humanity free of any copyright or licensing restrictions.

The monks of the \textsanskrit{Theragāthā} are my brothers. I can feel them through the years, their struggles and triumphs, their deep joys and nagging sorrows. They are also my idols, those humans who I would most like to be. 

The Buddha’s teachings are amazing. But it is not about the philosophy, it is about the people, about what mattered to them and what matters to us. In their fierce forests, their leaf huts, their tattered robes, the monks of old could not be more different than us.

Except in another way they are just like us. For the comforts of our civilization are but a veneer, a veil between us and the world as it has been lived by humans for thousands of years. How is it that when we look into our heart of hearts we yearn only to be free, and when we hear the words of people in such distant times and places, we find the same yearning?

To renounce is to dedicate one’s life to having less. For we who have taken the mendicant path, having things is a hassle, and having no things is freedom. It is strange to look at the world of consumerism and see how people have fought so hard for such a long time for the freedom to live their lives, to make their own choices, to be who they want to be. And what do they choose? To trap themselves in the plastic prison of their desires? To insist on getting what they want while giving not a single thought to wanting wisely? 

We shall leave all of this behind. We might as well start now.

\scbyline{Bhikkhu Sujato, 2022}

The \textsanskrit{Theragāthā} is a classic Pali collection of verses by early Buddhist monks. There is a parallel collection of nuns’ verses, the \textsanskrit{Therīgāthā}. The \textsanskrit{Theragāthā} consists of 1289 verses, collected according to the monk with whom they were traditionally associated. These poems speak from the personal experience of monks living in or near the time of the Buddha. More than any other text we find here a range of voices expressing the fears, inspirations, struggles, and triumphs of the spiritual search.

The \textsanskrit{Theragāthā} was the first major Pali work that I translated, and it was here that I developed my ideas of how to translate. I aimed to make a translation that is both precise and readable so that this astonishing work of ancient spiritual insight might enjoy the wider audience it so richly deserves. This essay is a revised version of the Introduction to the first paperback edition of this translation in 2014.

\section*{About the \textsanskrit{Theragāthā}}

I’d like to give a very brief and non-technical introduction to the text. If you are interested in a more detailed technical analysis, you can read Norman’s long introduction. This especially focuses on the metrical styles of the text, but in addition, it contains analyses of dating, composition, and authorship that are essential for any serious study.

Each of the verses of the \textsanskrit{Theragāthā} is collected under the name of a certain monk. Verses appear under the names of 264 monks, although occasionally a monk may have more than one set of verses. In many cases, the verses were composed by, or at least were supposed to be composed by, these monks. Generally speaking, I see no reason why the bulk of the verses should not be authentic. The \textsanskrit{Gāthās} are not wholly independent texts: many of the verses are found elsewhere in Buddhist texts. But while the concept of “authorship” was indeed a flexible one, most of the more striking verses do have a personal flavor of their author. The fancy stylings of the monk \textsanskrit{Vaṅgīsa} show off his poetic virtuosity (\href{https://suttacentral.net/thag21.1}{Thag 21.1}), while the emotional struggle of \textsanskrit{Tālapuṭa} expresses a deeply personal internal conflict and yearning (\href{https://suttacentral.net/thag19.1}{Thag 19.1}).

However, not all the verses can be ascribed to the monks in question. Sometimes the verses are in a dialogue form; or they may be teaching verses addressed to a monk; or they may be verses about a monk; in some cases they have been added by later redactors. Often the verses are in a vague third person, which leaves it ambiguous whether it was meant to be by the monk or about him. And sometimes verses are repeated, both within the \textsanskrit{Theragāthā} and in other Buddhist texts, so a speaker of a verse is not always its composer. Technically, then, the collection is “verses associated with the senior monks”.

I have used the term “senior monk” rather than “elder” to render \textit{thera} for a couple of reasons. First, it will make it easier to distinguish the collection from the \textsanskrit{Therīgāthā}. More importantly, not all the monks here are really “elders” in the sense of being wizened old men. Usually in Sangha usage a \textit{thera} is simply one who has completed ten years as a monk, so a monk of thirty years of age, while hardly an “elder”, may be a \textit{thera}.

As well as being collected according to the name of the associated monk, the texts are organized by number (the \textit{\textsanskrit{aṅguttara}} principle). That is, the first sets of verses are those where a monk is associated with only one verse; then two, three, and so on. There is, in addition, an occasional connection of subject matter or literary style from one verse to the other; and, rarely, a thin narrative context (eg. \href{https://suttacentral.net/thag16.1}{Thag 16.1}).

The numbering of the collections needs a little attention. The texts may be referenced by three means, all of which are available on SuttaCentral; either by simple verse count, or by chapter and verse, or by the page number of the PTS Pali edition.

The primary system used in SuttaCentral is the chapter and verse, as this collects all the verses associated with a given monk in one place. This chapter and verse system is not used in the PTS editions, but it is used in the \textsanskrit{Mahāsaṅgīti} text on which the translation is based. However this system can be a little confusing—or at least, I was confused by it! From the ones to the fourteens there is no problem. There is no set of fifteen verses, so we skip from the fourteens to the sixteens. Here the numbering of the sections goes out of alignment with the number of verses: the fifteenth section (\href{https://suttacentral.net/thag15.1}{Thag 15.1}) consists of a set of sixteen verses. The sixteenth section (\href{https://suttacentral.net/thag16.1}{Thag 16.1} etc.) then consists of sets of twenty or more verses, and so on.

In terms of dating, the \textsanskrit{Theragāthā} belongs firmly to the corpus of early Buddhist texts. Most of the monks are said to have lived in the time of the Buddha, and there seems no good reason to doubt this. In a few cases, due to the content of the text, the vocabulary or meter, or the statements in the commentary, the verses appear to date from as late as the time of King Ashoka. Norman suggests a period of composition of almost 300 years; however, if we adopt, as it seems we should, the “median chronology” that places the death of the Buddha not long before 400 BCE, then the period of composition would be closer to 200 years.

The \textsanskrit{Theragāthā} is placed as the eighth book of the Khuddaka \textsanskrit{Nikāya}, where it follows such late texts as the \textsanskrit{Vimānavatthu} and the Petavatthu. No particular conclusion can be drawn from this, however. There is, it’s true, a general tendency to group early texts at the start, while late additions are added at the end, but this general pattern admits many individual exceptions. The first book in the collection, after all, is the \textsanskrit{Khuddakapāṭha}, which is one of the latest books in the canon.

It seems the tradition was not tired of hearing the stories of monastics from the days of old, for a pair of texts, the Thera- and \textsanskrit{Therī}-\textsanskrit{Apadāna}, was developed to tell their past life stories. While ostensibly relating tales of most of the same monks and nuns as in the Thera- and \textsanskrit{Therīgātha}, these texts, which probably date 300–400 years after the Buddha, have no claim to historical authenticity. In place of the varied, vivid, and challenging verses of the earlier works, which focus on the life and practice to be done in this life, these works attribute the Awakening of the monastics to pious acts of merit-making in far-gone ages.

As with all Pali texts, the \textsanskrit{Theragāthā} is passed down in the tradition alongside a commentary, in this case, written by \textsanskrit{Dhammapāla} approximately 1,000 years after the text itself. I have consulted the commentary in cases where the meaning of the verse was unclear to me, and for myself, as for all serious scholars, the commentaries have proven invaluable.

As well as providing the normal kinds of linguistic and doctrinal analysis, the \textsanskrit{Theragāthā} commentary gives background stories for the lives of the monks, many of whom we know little about apart from the \textsanskrit{Theragāthā} itself. These stories draw largely from the \textsanskrit{Apadānas}. In some cases, the stories provide context to make sense of the verses, and there seems little doubt that these verses, as is the normal way in Pali, were passed down from the earliest times with some form of narrative context and explanation. Like the \textsanskrit{Jātakas}, the Dhammapada, or the \textsanskrit{Udāna}, the verses formed the emotional and doctrinal kernel of the story. However, in the form that we have today, the commentary speaks to a set of concerns and ideas that date long after the \textsanskrit{Theragāthā} itself. While the commentary is invaluable in understanding what the meaning of these texts was for the Theravadin tradition, only in rare cases does it provide genuine historical information about the monks.

What is striking to me is just how clear-cut the demarcation of Pali texts really is. The Thera- and \textsanskrit{Therīgāthā} lie on the far side of a dividing line in Pali literature. They are concerned with seclusion, meditation, mindfulness, and above all, liberation. From the time of Ashoka or thereabouts, texts such as the \textsanskrit{Apadānas} became concerned with glorifying the Buddha, and especially with encouraging acts of merit for attaining heaven or enlightenment in future lives. Such concerns are notable for their absence from the \textsanskrit{Theragāthā}; when they are present, such as Sela’s verses extolling the Buddha, they remain grounded in human experience, rather than the elaborate fantasies of later days.

There are very few exceptions, such as \href{https://suttacentral.net/thag1.96}{Thag 1.96} \textsanskrit{Khaṇḍasumana}, which says how after offering a flower he rejoiced in heaven for 800 million years, and then attained \textit{\textsanskrit{Nibbāna}} with what was left over. But this is just so out of place. Among the countless verses that speak of retreating to solitude, of devotion to \textit{\textsanskrit{jhāna}}, of renouncing everything in the world, such sentiments seem as if from a different world of thought—a different religion even. Yet the \textsanskrit{Apadānas} consist of little more than lengthy elaborations of this kind of story.

The classical \textsanskrit{Theragāthā} verse is a song of liberation, rejoicing in a simple life lived with nature. Here’s a typical example, from \href{https://suttacentral.net/thag1.22}{Thag 1.22}, the verse of Cittaka:

\begin{verse}%
Crested peacocks with beautiful blue necks \\
Cry out in \textsanskrit{Karaṃvī}. \\
Aroused by a cool breeze, \\
They awaken the sleeper to practice \textit{\textsanskrit{jhāna}}.

%
\end{verse}

But the verses embrace a wide range of subjects; straightforward doctrinal statements, lamentations of the decline of the Sangha, eulogy of great monks, or simple narrative.

While the texts are mostly direct and clear-hearted, some of the most interesting verses are those that speak from the mind’s contradictions, the longings that bedevil the spiritual life. Nowhere has this very human ambiguity been expressed better than in the extended set of verses by \textsanskrit{Tālapuṭa} (\href{https://suttacentral.net/thag19.1}{Thag 19.1}). Employing an unusually sophisticated poetic style—only exceeded in this regard by \textsanskrit{Vaṅgīsa}, in whose verses we can discern the beginnings of the decadent poetics of later generations—and addressing his stubborn mind in the second person (A rare appearance of the neuter vocative) he berates it for its inconstancy:

\begin{verse}%
Oh, when will the winter clouds rain freshly \\
As I wear my robe in the forest, \\
Walking the path trodden by the sages? \\
When will it be? …

For many years you begged me, \\
“Enough of living in a house for you!” \\
Why do you not urge me on, mind, \\
Now I’ve gone forth as an ascetic?

%
\end{verse}

There is one text that deserves a special mention. The verses of \textsanskrit{Vaḍḍha} at \href{https://suttacentral.net/thag5.5}{Thag 5.5} are not an independent composition but continue the poem begun under the name of \textsanskrit{Vaḍḍha}’s Mother in the \textsanskrit{Therīgāthā} (\href{https://suttacentral.net/thig9.1/en/sujato}{Thig 9.1}). That these are one composition split in two can be seen by several linguistic features, such as the use of a demonstrative pronoun (\textit{\textsanskrit{tassāhaṁ} \textsanskrit{vacanaṁ} \textsanskrit{sutvā}}) in \href{https://suttacentral.net/thig9.1/en/sujato}{Thig 9.1} echoed with a relative pronoun (\textit{\textsanskrit{yassāhaṁ} \textsanskrit{vacanaṁ} \textsanskrit{sutvā}}) in \href{https://suttacentral.net/thag5.5}{Thag 5.5}. The story tells of how \textsanskrit{Vaḍḍha} was urged to practice by his mother, who he realizes has seen the Dhamma herself. The plot twist comes when we realize that his sister, too, has seen the Dhamma.

Of all the texts in the Pali canon, it is in the verses of these senior monks, and the nuns of the \textsanskrit{Therīgāthā}, that we come closest to the personal experience of living in the time of the Buddha, struggling with, and eventually overcoming, the causes of suffering that are so captivating. I hope that this new translation can help bring these experiences to life for a new audience.

\section*{Gender and Empathy: Comparing \textsanskrit{Theragāthā} with \textsanskrit{Therīgāthā}}

The division of texts into those authored by men and by women invites consideration of gender. The basic division is along the lines of the traditional gender binary, and it is tempting to analyze them in this light. Yet the movement of the Dhamma, and many specific details in the texts, suggests a blurring of the lines, a nuancing of the black and white that invites participation by those whose gender is not so easily categorized. We have all been men and women in our countless past lives, and trans and non-binary as well. Gendered language and culture are our past and our present, but it does not have to be our future.

Questions of gender are rarely raised by the nuns and monks in the \textsanskrit{Theragāthā} and \textsanskrit{Therīgāthā}, and overwhelmingly, the teachings, practices, and insights are the same regardless of sex and gender. The word for “womanhood” (\textit{\textsanskrit{itthibhāva}}), for example, is mentioned twice in the \textsanskrit{Therīgāthā}, once in response to a sexist attack by \textsanskrit{Māra} the wicked deity (\href{https://suttacentral.net/thig3.8/en/sujato\#2.1}{Thig 3.8:2.1}), and once in reference to a teaching of the Buddha (\href{https://suttacentral.net/thig10.1/en/sujato\#4.1}{Thig 10.1:4.1}). There, gender is raised in a spirit of empathy, recognizing the special kinds of suffering that a woman must endure, sometimes at the hands of men. This is sometimes overinterpreted to imply that such suffering helps women to get enlightened. But the texts never say this. We all have plenty of suffering, and more is not better. It’s dangerous to imply that women \emph{should} suffer because it will lead to their spiritual betterment: that is the message of every exploitative guru. The Buddha was sensitive to the sufferings women had to undergo, and the purpose of his path was so that they could be free.

If we wish to find the differences between the genders, then, it is tempting to use the extra information included in the commentaries, which provide fairly extensive backstories for the monks and nuns. Unfortunately, these narratives are unlikely to contain much in the way of accurate history, and by and large, are tales told within the tradition as collected by male commentators a thousand years later in a different country.

Dialogue around the body and its beauty is found more often among the nuns, but perspectives on the female body are not different in kind from those towards the male body. The Buddha was often described as beautiful, a point which the texts elucidate in great detail. But when an adoring disciple longed to behold the Buddha’s body, he rebuked him, describing his own body as “putrid” (\href{https://suttacentral.net/sn22.87/en/sujato\#3.1}{SN 22.87:3.1}). In the \textsanskrit{Theragāthā}, the monk Nanda reflects on his freedom from his former addiction to beauty and ornamentation (\href{https://suttacentral.net/thag2.19}{Thag 2.19}). Worrying about appearance is not just for women.

The famous verses of \textsanskrit{Ambapālī} (\href{https://suttacentral.net/thig13.1/en/sujato}{Thig 13.1}), where she eloquently details the faded beauty of her aging body, are perhaps the finest expression of the impermanence of the body in all Buddhist literature. But her poetry does not appear in a vacuum. She was a wealthy courtesan who, outfoxing the powerful youths of the Vajji clan, presented the Buddha with the gift of a monastery. As a sex worker, she is not depicted as a victim in need of saving, but as a powerful and independent woman who exercises her choice to help the Buddha and the Sangha. 

She met the Buddha near the end of his life when he described his own body as like a “decrepit cart held together with straps” (\href{https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato\#2.25.11}{DN 16:2.25.11}), and said he could only escape the weariness and pain of the body in deep meditation. The imposing physical form of the young warrior prince was long gone: it was the greying Buddha of his final days that \textsanskrit{Ambapālī} met. And the sight seems to have made a deep impression on her, for her verses are a meditation on aging.

\textsanskrit{Ambapālī}’s unique contribution lies not in her contemplation of her body as impermanent, but in how she expresses this in verses of unequaled poetic grace. Starting with the crowning glory of her hair, she works gradually through the parts of the body, loosely echoing the standard meditation on parts of the body, which also starts with the hair. Each verse evokes with vivid and specific metaphors the before and after, how she was in her youth and how she is now, in her old age. 

\begin{verse}%
My nose was like a perfect peak, \\
lovely in my bloom of youth; \\
now old, it’s shriveled like a pepper; \\
the word of the truthful one is confirmed.

%
\end{verse}

The verses must have been composed some decades after the Buddha’s death, for she was not old when she met him in \textsanskrit{Vesālī}. She employs to the full the poetic arts in which she had trained as a courtesan, showing off the old skills that she learned with the intent to entice, now employed for dispassion. Yet nowhere is there a skerrick of shame or reproach for her past career as a sex worker. It is simply how the sensual world is. These are verses of dignity and acceptance, not of shame and repentance. She is still the same woman she was then, but her beauty is now in the wisdom that takes form in her words. Where the Buddha was blunt and unsparing in his assessment of his own body, \textsanskrit{Ambapālī} elevates each detail, devoting the same loving care to both the glories of her past and the fading of the present. Her body in all its changes is her witness to the truth. And the verses, through describing and accepting both the beautiful and the ugly, create a new kind of beauty. Their effect is not repulsive or depressing, but uplifting.

While \textsanskrit{Ambapālī} creates a new kind of effect through her poetic skills, we also find more simple expressions of the contemplation of the body. In later forms of Buddhist literature, it is often the case that such contemplation is gendered: it is male observers seeing the decay of the female body. But this is not the case in early Buddhism. To illustrate this, let’s look at a short passage that is uttered by three mendicants: the nuns \textsanskrit{Abhirūpānandā} (\href{https://suttacentral.net/thig2.1/en/sujato}{Thig 2.1}) and \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā} (\href{https://suttacentral.net/thig5.4/en/sujato}{Thig 5.4}), and the monk Kulla (\href{https://suttacentral.net/thag6.4}{Thag 6.4}). The verse is in the second person as it is addressed to the mendicant concerned, and the only difference between the versions is the name. The nuns are addressed as “\textsanskrit{Nandā}”.

\begin{verse}%
\textsanskrit{Nandā}, see this bag of bones as \\
diseased, filthy, and rotten.

%
\end{verse}

From this we learn that the monks and nuns received the same meditation instructions. They undertook the same practices, and did so within a shared body of teaching and understanding, aiming for the same goal, of freedom from attachment.

There is an interesting difference, however. The nuns reflect in the way that is normal in the early texts, starting with “this body”, i.e. their own depersonalized body, rather than one that is objectified and externalized. For Kulla, however, his reflection came about because he went to a cemetery for meditation, where he saw the worm-eaten corpse of a woman’s body, prompting the reflection on the body’s repulsiveness. At first glance, this is reminiscent of how in later texts an objectified woman’s body becomes the object of repulsion for men.

All is not, however, as it seems. The first verse of Kulla is in the first person, while the second verse, which contains the passage shared with the nuns, is in the second person: an unnamed speaker is addressing Kulla. But if he entered the cemetery for solitary meditation, who is talking to him? Of course, it’s not anyone: Kulla is reflecting on a teaching that had previously been given to him, presumably by the Buddha. So the Buddha’s teaching to Kulla turns out to have been identical to that which he gave the nuns: to reflect on “this body” as repulsive. It is Kulla who, spurred by the sight of the rotting female corpse, takes up the “teaching as a mirror”, reflecting that his body is no different. The whole point is to undermine the distinction between the body he has and the one he observes, between internal and external, between the “male” body and the “female” body, to see that they share the same nature. Such meditations don’t enforce gender, they erase it.

These are strong practices to be sure. And the Buddhist texts warn of the distressing consequences of undertaking them when not balanced and emotionally ready. For those who do undertake them in the right way, they lead not to distress, but to solace; not to anxiety but to relief; and ultimately to the stillness and peace of immersion in meditation. \textsanskrit{Sundarīnandā} says she “saw” the truth, and now is “quenched and at peace”. Similarly, Kulla says:

\begin{verse}%
Even the music of a five-piece band \\
can never give such pleasure \\
as when, with unified mind, \\
you rightly discern the Dhamma.

%
\end{verse}

So the monks and nuns were both given the same teaching; they both used that teaching to develop a meditative reflection; doing so they found peace of mind; and the peace of mind led to freedom and happiness. When the opportunity came for the monk Kulla to objectify and differentiate his own body from a female body, he took the opposite approach, erasing differences by seeing himself in her.

The Buddhist approach is not “body positivity” but “body neutrality”. Those who see the body entranced by desire need the strong pill of repulsion to clear their minds. But this would be exactly the wrong approach for someone affected by anxiety or insecurity regarding their body, for whom a solid foundation in breath meditation or loving-kindness meditation is recommended. An uncritical body positivity too often leads, in a fairly straight line, to exploitation and abuse of women at the hands of men on the one hand, and body-image distress among women on the other.  

The early Buddhist texts have both positive and negative depictions of bodies, and this is completely realistic: bodies are both beautiful and disgusting. Buddhism is the original anti-essentialism. We don’t focus on one aspect of the body or another because that is the essence of what the body is, but to counter imbalances and lead to a healthy and reasonable equanimity. To take this seriously is to challenge the implicit binding of both men and women to their bodies and to move beyond such binary divisions. 

\section*{How This Translation Came About}

The process of creating the translation was this. For many years, we at SuttaCentral had gathered translations in many modern languages, aiming for as broad a coverage as possible. I was keen to create a complete set of translations for early Buddhist texts. Yet at that time, not all early Buddhist texts were freely available on the internet in English, and I wanted to change that. In 2013 I was approached by Jessica Walton (then \textsanskrit{Ayyā} \textsanskrit{Nibbidā}), a student of mine, who wanted a project to help learn Pali. I suggested that she work on the Thera/Theri-\textsanskrit{gāthā}, in the hope that we could create a freely available translation.

Of course, this is a terrible job for a student—these are among the more difficult texts in the Pali Canon. But I hoped that it would prove useful, and so it has. I suggested that Jessica use Norman’s translation together with the Pali, and work on creating a more readable rendering. She did this, mostly working on her own.

When she was happy with that, she passed the project over to me, and when I got the chance I took it up. I then went over the text in detail, modifying virtually every one of Jessica’s lines, while still keeping many of her turns of phrase. Without her work, this translation would not have been completed. Since this translation was first released in 2014, I have continued to revise, correct, and update in line with my subsequent work.

I also referred heavily to Norman’s translation, which enabled me to make sense of the many obscurities of vocabulary and syntax found in the text. Only rarely have I departed from Norman’s linguistic interpretations, and I have adopted his renderings on occasions when I felt I couldn’t do better.

There are, however, many occasions when Norman’s work is limited by his purely linguistic approach. There is no better example of this than \href{https://suttacentral.net/thag6.7/en/sujato\#1.1}{Thag 6.7:1.1}. The Pali begins \textit{\textsanskrit{uṭṭhehi} \textsanskrit{nisīda}}, on which Norman notes:

\begin{quotation}%
The collocation of “stand up” and “sit down” is strange and one or other of the words is used metaphorically.

%
\end{quotation}

He then renders the verse thus:

\begin{quotation}%
Stand up, \textsanskrit{Kātiyāna}, pay attention; do not be full of sleep, be awake. May the kinsman of the indolent, king death, not conquer lazy you, as though with a snare.

%
\end{quotation}

But to any meditator there is nothing strange about this at all; it just means to get up and meditate. I render the verse:

\begin{verse}%
Get up, \textsanskrit{Kātiyāna}, and sit! \\
Don’t sleep too much, be wakeful. \\
Don’t be lazy, and let the kinsman of the heedless, \\
The king of death, catch you in his trap.

%
\end{verse}

In addition to Norman’s translation, I consulted translations by Bhikkhu \textsanskrit{Ṭhānissaro} and Bhikkhu Bodhi for a few verses. However, I did not consult the Rhys Davids translation at all.

In the original translation, I followed the common practice of leaving a few terms in Pali, as they refer to refined spiritual concepts for which we simply have no parallels in the West. I have subsequently decided to translate these, but the notes I made are, I think, still relevant, and I have adapted and expanded them here.

\subsection*{\textit{\textsanskrit{Samādhi}} (“immersion”)}

This is the poster child for those who believe that it’s best to just leave problematic terms in the original. But if we leave it in the Indic, whose \textit{\textsanskrit{samādhi}} do we mean? In the Brahmanical tradition, \textit{\textsanskrit{samādhi}} means the transcendent union of the individual self with the cosmic divinity, or else the death of a sage. In Thailand, \textit{\textsanskrit{samādhi}} commonly means “meditate”, so to “sit \textit{\textsanskrit{samādhi}}” doesn’t necessarily imply abiding in deep absorption. In the vipassana schools, \textit{\textsanskrit{samādhi}} refers to a moment-to-moment mindful awareness of changing phenomena. In the Suttas, \textit{\textsanskrit{samādhi}} means a deep state of meditative absorption, or \textit{\textsanskrit{jhāna}}. What a reader takes away depends not on any intrinsic meaning of the word—for words have no intrinsic meaning—but on their prior conditioning.

In Buddhism, or at least in early Buddhism, it is an exalted term, as it was for the brahmins, although of course without the metaphysical implications. It means the transcendence of the realm of the senses, the union of the mind in a deep, serene, stillness; a state of mind so powerful it literally makes you God. Through the practice of \textit{\textsanskrit{samādhi}} one would be reborn in the realms of the highest divinities, the Brahma gods.

It could perhaps be rendered as “coalescence” or “stillness”. My teacher Ajahn Brahm prefers “stillness”, but when I tried using this rendering I found that in context it was often misleading, as it sounded like the meditators were just being still. Also, even as a psychological term, it is very subjective when used without context—what Ajahn Brahm means by stillness is one thing, but what most people think is stillness is quite another. When speaking, one can add context to make the meaning clear, but a translator enjoys no such luxury.

Certainly it does \emph{not} mean “concentration”, which is, I believe, the single most damaging translation in Buddhism. This rendering has misled an entire generation of meditators, who think they have to force themselves to focus on a single point to gain \textit{\textsanskrit{samādhi}}. This is very different from the “vast”, “immeasurable” state of \textit{\textsanskrit{samādhi}} taught by the Buddha, as “broad as the great earth”.

In central doctrinal contexts, \textit{\textsanskrit{samādhi}} is defined as the four \textit{\textsanskrit{jhānas}}. It is true that  \textit{\textsanskrit{samādhi}} is used in a somewhat flexible way in the Suttas, and the meaning is on occasion broader than this. But such contexts tend to be personal, poetic, or specific discussions with a limited scope. When used in the central teachings of Buddhism—the threefold training, the eightfold path, the five spiritual faculties, and so on—\textit{\textsanskrit{samādhi}} means \textit{\textsanskrit{jhāna}}.

After a long time, I settled on “immersion” for \textit{\textsanskrit{samādhi}}. I came upon it by seeing how the word “immerse” was used in common English. It means a state of mind that is absorbed or engrossed: “I was so immersed in the book, I didn’t hear you come home.” Tech folks use it to describe an application that draws a user in without being distracted by things outside. I think this captures an important part of the meaning of \textit{\textsanskrit{samādhi}}. Importantly, it retains something of a sense of being a special or technical word, so it’s less likely to be misunderstood.

\subsection*{\textit{\textsanskrit{Jhāna}} (“absorption”)}

This is also an exalted state, and cannot be translated as “meditation”, which is, rather, the practice that leads to \textit{\textsanskrit{jhāna}}. In the Suttas this is called \textit{\textsanskrit{satipaṭṭhāna}} (“mindfulness meditation”).

Terms derived from the same root as root \textit{\textsanskrit{jhāna}} often emphasize mental steadiness or focus: a donkey gazing at their food, or the ruminations of a depressed and obsessive person obsessing. But in Pali, the term has a dual sense, for it also refers to lamps burning, and this is applied quite explicitly in the context of meditation (\href{https://suttacentral.net/mn127/en/sujato\#16.4}{MN 127:16.4}).

I think the Pali usage draws from the Brahmanical concept of \textit{\textsanskrit{dhī}}, which is the divine inspiration of the rising sun, filling the world with light, and raising the mind to awakening. \textit{\textsanskrit{Dhī}} is used twice in the most famous of the Vedic verses, the \textsanskrit{Gāyatrī} Mantra,  which is recited at dawn by Brahmans: “We lift our minds to the divine radiance of the glorious sun: may he waken our minds!” This verse is referred to several times in the Pali texts, where it is called the \textsanskrit{Sāvittī}, which is a name for the Sun in its role as empowerer or vivifier (\href{https://suttacentral.net/snp3.4/en/sujato\#7.3}{Snp 3.4:7.3}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/mn92/en/sujato\#26.2}{MN 92:26.2}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali\#35.8.3}{Vinaya Khandhaka 6:35.8.3}).

This would suggest a rendering like “illumination”, but this is not a natural idiom for meditation in English. “Absorption” has served translators fairly well, and I follow suit.

While the dual roots of \textit{\textsanskrit{jhāna}} are well known, it is a curious detail that \textit{\textsanskrit{samādhi}}, too, has dual roots, and they are parallel to those for \textit{\textsanskrit{jhāna}}. Like \textit{\textsanskrit{jhāna}}, \textit{\textsanskrit{samādhi}} has a primary sense of composure, centeredness, gathering, like a tortoise drawing its limbs in the shell. Less commonly, a homonym refers to the “kindling” of a fire. So both \textit{jhana} and \textit{\textsanskrit{samādhi}} convey the dual senses of “coalescence” and “illumination”, which reflect the extremely common association of these states with the light and radiance experienced by the meditator.

\section*{A Brief Textual History}

The \textsanskrit{Theragāthā} was published by the Pali Text Society in 1883, with Hermann Oldenberg and Richard Pischel serving as editors. They made use of two manuscripts in Burmese scripts, and one in Sinhala, as well as a commentary in Sinhalese characters. Oldenburg pointed out the widespread occurrence of mistakes common to all three editions as an unmistakable sign that they all ultimately hailed from the same source. As is well known, almost all Sinhalese manuscripts available today were copied from originals brought back from Burma, and do not constitute a separate Sinhalese lineage.

A second edition of this text was published in 1966 (reprinted 1990) with two new Appendices: additional variant readings supplied by K.R. Norman and metrical analysis by L. Alsdorf.

My translation is based on the \textsanskrit{Mahāsaṅgīti} edition of the Pali canon as published on SuttaCentral. It numbers 1289 verses as opposed to the 1279 of the PTS editions. The extra verses arise, not from a difference in substance, but from the inclusion of repetitions that were absent from the PTS editions. The first set of extra verses is at verse 1020 and the second at verse 1161. Up to verse 1020, therefore, the numbering is the same in the SuttaCentral and PTS editions.

The \textsanskrit{Theragāthā} has been fully translated into English twice before, both times published by the Pali Text Society. The efforts of the former translators are indispensable, and their work makes each succeeding attempt that much easier. Nevertheless, the limitations of these earlier translations are well known.

The first translation was by Caroline A.F. Rhys Davids in 1913 as \textit{Psalms of the Brethren}. It employed the then-fashionable approach of using archaic language as a signifier of religious significance. Modern readers unfamiliar with early 20th-century writing might be forgiven for thinking that this was simply how people spoke back then. But even at the time it was old-fashioned, and quite deliberately so. The translation was the first attempt by a serious scholar to capture both the meaning and the excitement of the text, as well as quotes from the commentaries.

A much-needed update was supplied by K.R. Norman in 1969 as \textit{Elders’ Verses, volume I}, later reissued without notes in paperback as \textit{Poems of Early Buddhist Monks}. As if reacting to the emotionality of Rhys David’s version, Norman’s translation employed what Norman himself described as “a starkness and austerity of words which borders on the ungrammatical”. It is an exemplary linguistic study, and it serves well as a resource for scholars and as a reference point for future translators.

\textsanskrit{Sāmaṇera} Mahinda published a bilingual Pali-English edition in 2022 under the title \textit{\textsanskrit{Theragāthā}: Verses of the Elder Bhikkhus} through Dhamma Publishers. 97 of the \textsanskrit{Theragāthā} verses have also been translated by Ven. \textsanskrit{Ṭhānissaro}.

\scnamo{Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! }

\begin{verse}%
Like\marginnote{1.1} the lions of mighty fang \\
who roar in mountain caves—\\
hear now from those who’ve practiced well \\
their own verses about themselves. 

What\marginnote{2.1} their name, and what their clan, \\
and how they lived by the teaching; \\
how dedicated were those wise ones, \\
as they meditated tirelessly. 

Clearly\marginnote{3.1} discerning in every case, \\
they reached the state that does not pass. \\
Reviewing their completed task, \\
they spoke about it in these words.

\subsection*{\textsanskrit{Subhūti} }

\begin{verse}%
My\marginnote{4.1} little hut is roofed and pleasant, \\>sheltered from the wind: \\
so rain, heavens, as you please!\footnote{The word \textit{deva} (“god”) is closely connected with the idea of the sky. The “god” of thunder and rain (perhaps to be identified with the god named Pajjuna) is a terrifying threat to those who are exposed outdoors. Here the monk snug in his little hut invokes the god in contrast to the safety of peace. This idea recurs many times in the \textsanskrit{Theragāthā}. At \href{https://suttacentral.net/snp1.2/en/sujato}{Snp 1.2} the same notion occurs in the context of making household offerings to the gods. } \\
My mind is serene and freed, \\
I practice wholeheartedly: so rain, heavens!

\begin{verse}%
Don’t\marginnote{1.1} get involved in lots of work, \\
avoid people, and don’t try to acquire things. \\
If you’re eager and greedy for flavors, \\
you’ll miss the goal that brings such happiness. 

They\marginnote{2.1} know it really is a bog, \\
this homage and veneration in respectable families. \\
Honor is a subtle dart, hard to extract, \\
and hard for a sinner to give up. 

The\marginnote{3.1} deeds of a mortal aren’t bad \\
because of what others do. \\
You yourself should not do bad, \\
for mortals have deeds as their kin. 

You’re\marginnote{4.1} not a bandit because of what someone says, \\
you’re not a sage because of what someone says; \\
but as you know yourself, \\
so the gods will know you. 

When\marginnote{5.1} others do not understand, \\
let us, who do understand this, \\
restrain ourselves in this regard; \\
for that is how conflicts are laid to rest. 

A\marginnote{6.1} wise person lives on \\
even after loss of wealth; \\
but without gaining wisdom, \\
even a rich person doesn’t really live. 

All\marginnote{7.1} is heard with the ear, \\
all is seen with the eye; \\
the attentive ought not discard \\
all that is seen and heard. 

Though\marginnote{8.1} you have eyes, be as if blind; \\
though you have ears, be as if deaf; \\
though you have wisdom, be as if dumb; \\
though you have strength, be as if feeble. \\
And when issues come up \\
lie as still as a corpse.

When\marginnote{1.1} I first saw the Teacher \\
who fears nothing from any quarter, \\
I was struck with a sense of urgency, \\
seeing the supreme among men. 

Anyone\marginnote{2.1} who, having found such a Teacher, \\

would ward her off with their hands and feet.\footnote{The same idiom recurs at \href{https://suttacentral.net/mn49/en/sujato\#5.9}{MN 49:5.9}. } 

Then\marginnote{3.1} I left behind my children and wives, \\
my riches and my grain; \\
I had my hair and beard cut off, \\
and went forth to homelessness. 

Endowed\marginnote{4.1} with the monastic training and livelihood, \\
my sense faculties well-restrained, \\
paying homage to the Buddha, \\
I meditated undefeated. 

Then\marginnote{5.1} a wish occurred to me, \\
my heart’s truest wish: \\
I wouldn’t sit down, not even for a short while, \\
until the dart of craving was plucked. 

As\marginnote{6.1} I meditate like this, \\
see my energy and vigor! \\
I’ve attained the three knowledges, \\
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions. 

I\marginnote{7.1} know my past lives, \\
my clairvoyance is clarified; \\
I’m perfected, worthy of offerings, \\
liberated, free of attachments. 

Then,\marginnote{8.1} at the end of the night, \\
as the rising of the sun drew near, \\
all craving was dried up, \\
so I sat down cross-legged.

For the dead, there is only weeping.

\begin{verse}%
One\marginnote{1.1} should train just in ethical conduct, \\
for in this world, when ethical conduct is \\
cultivated and well-trained, \\
it provides all success. 

Wishing\marginnote{2.1} for three kinds of happiness—\\
praise, prosperity, \\
and to delight in heaven after passing away—\\
the wise would take care of their ethics. 

The\marginnote{3.1} well-behaved have many friends, \\
because of their self-restraint. \\
But one lacking ethics, of bad conduct, \\
drives away their friends. 

A\marginnote{4.1} person whose ethics are bad has \\
ill-repute and infamy. \\
A person whose conduct is ethical always has \\
a good reputation, fame, and praise. 

Ethical\marginnote{5.1} conduct is the starting point and foundation; \\
the mother at the head \\
of all good things: \\
that’s why you should purify your ethics. 

Ethics\marginnote{6.1} provide a boundary and a restraint, \\
an enjoyment for the mind; \\
the ford where all the Buddhas cross over: \\
that’s why you should purify your ethics. 

Ethics\marginnote{7.1} are the matchless power; \\
ethics are the ultimate weapon; \\
ethics are the best ornament; \\
ethics are a marvelous coat of armor. 

Ethics\marginnote{8.1} are a mighty bridge; \\
ethics are the unsurpassed scent; \\
ethics are the best perfume, \\
that float from place to place. 

Ethics\marginnote{9.1} are the best provision; \\
ethics are the unsurpassed supply for a journey; \\
ethics are the best vehicle \\
that take you from place to place. 

In\marginnote{10.1} this life they’re criticized; \\
after departing they grieve in a lower realm; \\
a fool is unhappy everywhere, \\
because they are unsteady in ethics. 

In\marginnote{11.1} this life they’re renowned; \\
after departing they’re happy in heaven; \\
the attentive are happy everywhere, \\
because they are steady in ethics. 

Ethical\marginnote{12.1} conduct is best in this life, \\
but one with wisdom is supreme. \\
Someone with both virtue and wisdom \\
is victorious among men and gods.

\begin{verse}%
I\marginnote{1.1} was born in a low-class family. \\
We were poor, with little to eat. \\
My job was lowly—\\
I threw out the old flowers. 

Shunned\marginnote{2.1} by people, \\
I was disregarded and held in contempt. \\
I humbled my heart \\
and paid respects to many people. 

Then\marginnote{3.1} I saw the Buddha \\
at the fore of the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}; \\
the great hero \\
was entering the capital city of the Magadhans. 

I\marginnote{4.1} dropped my flail \\
and approached to pay homage. \\
Out of sympathy for me, \\
the supreme man stood still. 

When\marginnote{5.1} I had paid homage at the Teacher’s feet, \\
I stood to one side \\
and asked the supreme being \\
for the going-forth. 

Then\marginnote{6.1} the Teacher, being sympathetic, \\
and having sympathy for the whole world, \\
said to me, “Come, monk!” \\
That was my ordination. 

Staying\marginnote{7.1} alone in the wilderness, \\
meditating tirelessly, \\
I have completed what the Teacher taught, \\
just as the victor advised me. 

In\marginnote{8.1} the first watch of the night, \\
I recollected my past lives. \\
In the middle watch, \\
I purified my clairvoyance. \\
In the last watch, \\
I shattered the mass of darkness. 

At\marginnote{9.1} the end of the night, \\
as the sunrise drew near, \\
Indra and the Divinity came \\
and revered me with joined hands. 

“Homage\marginnote{10.1} to you, O thoroughbred! \\
Homage to you, supreme among men! \\
Since your defilements are ended, \\
you, sir, are worthy of a religious donation.” 

When\marginnote{11.1} he saw me honored \\
by the assembly of gods, \\
the teacher smiled \\
and said the following: 

“By\marginnote{12.1} fervor and spiritual practice, \\
by restraint and by self-control: \\
that’s how to become a brahmin, \\
this is the supreme brahmin.”

He\marginnote{1.1} who was special in the kingdom, \\
the footman to the king of \textsanskrit{Aṅga}, \\
today is special in the Dhamma—\\
\textsanskrit{Soṇa} has gone beyond suffering. 

Five\marginnote{2.1} to cut, five to drop, \\
and five more to develop. \\
When a mendicant slips five chains \\
they’re said to have crossed the flood. 

If\marginnote{3.1} a monk is insolent and negligent, \\
concerned only with externals, \\
their ethics, immersion, and wisdom \\
do not become fulfilled. 

They\marginnote{4.1} disregard what should be done, \\
and do what should not be done. \\
For the insolent and the negligent, \\
their defilements only grow. 

Those\marginnote{5.1} that have properly undertaken \\
constant mindfulness of the body, \\
don’t cultivate what should not be done, \\
but always do what should be done. \\
Mindful and aware, \\
their defilements come to an end. 

The\marginnote{6.1} straight path has been explained—\\
go on it and don’t turn back. \\
Urge yourself on \\
and take yourself to extinguishment. 

When\marginnote{7.1} my energy was over-exerted, \\
the supreme Teacher in the world \\
created the simile of the arched harp for me. \\
The Clear-eyed One taught the Dhamma, \\
and when I heard what he said, \\
I happily did his bidding. 

Practicing\marginnote{8.1} serenity of mind \\
for the attainment of the highest goal. \\
I’ve attained the three knowledges \\
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions. 

When\marginnote{9.1} you’re dedicated to renunciation \\
and seclusion of the heart; \\
when you’re dedicated to kindness \\
and the end of grasping; 

when\marginnote{10.1} you’re dedicated to the ending of craving \\
and clarity of heart; \\
and you’ve seen the arising of the senses, \\
your mind is rightly freed. 

For\marginnote{11.1} that one, rightly freed, \\
a mendicant with peaceful mind, \\
there’s nothing to be improved, \\
and nothing more to do. 

As\marginnote{12.1} the wind cannot stir \\
a solid mass of rock, \\
so too sights, tastes, sounds, \\
smells, and touches—the lot—

and\marginnote{13.1} ideas, whether liked or disliked, \\
don’t disturb the unaffected one. \\
Their mind is steady and unfettered \\
as they observe disappearance.

Since\marginnote{1.1} I’ve gone forth \\
from the lay life to homelessness, \\
I’ve not been aware of any thought \\
that is ignoble and hateful. 

“May\marginnote{2.1} these beings be killed! \\
May they be slaughtered! May they suffer!”—\\
I’ve not been aware of any such thought \\
in all this long while. 

I\marginnote{3.1} have been aware of loving-kindness, \\
limitless and well-developed; \\
gradually consolidated \\
as it was taught by the Buddha. 

I’m\marginnote{4.1} friend and comrade to all, \\
sympathetic for all beings! \\
I develop a mind of love, \\
always delighting in harmlessness. 

The\marginnote{5.1} unfaltering, the unshakable: \\
I gladden that mind. \\
I develop a divine meditation, \\
which sinners do not cultivate. 

When\marginnote{6.1} in a meditation  free of placing the mind, \\
a disciple of the Buddha \\
is at that moment blessed \\
with noble silence. 

As\marginnote{7.1} a rocky mountain \\
is unwavering and well grounded, \\
so when delusion ends, \\
a monk, like a mountain, doesn’t tremble. 

To\marginnote{8.1} the man who has not a blemish \\
who is always seeking purity, \\
even a hair-tip of evil \\
seems as big as a cloud. 

As\marginnote{9.1} a frontier city \\
is guarded inside and out, \\
so you should ward yourselves—\\
don’t let the moment pass you by. 

I\marginnote{10.1} don’t long for death; \\
I don’t long for life; \\
I await my time, \\
like a worker waiting for their wages. 

I\marginnote{11.1} don’t long for death; \\
I don’t long for life; \\
I await my time, \\

Just\marginnote{1.1} as a fine thoroughbred, \\
yoked to a carriage, endures the load. \\
Though oppressed by the heavy burden, \\
it doesn’t shake off the yoke. 

So\marginnote{2.1} too, those who are as full of wisdom \\
as the ocean is with water, \\
don’t look down on others; \\
this is the teaching of the noble ones \\>for living creatures. 

People\marginnote{3.1} who fall under the sway of time, \\
the sway of rebirth in this or that state, \\
undergo suffering, \\
and those young men grieve in this life. 

Elated\marginnote{4.1} by things that bring happiness, \\
downcast by things that bring suffering: \\
this pair destroys the fool \\
who doesn’t see things as they are. 

But\marginnote{5.1} those who in suffering, and in happiness, \\
and in the middle have overcome the weaver—\\
they stand like a boundary pillar, \\
neither elated nor downcast. 

Not\marginnote{6.1} to gain nor loss, \\
not to fame nor reputation, \\
not to criticism nor praise, \\
not to suffering nor happiness—

the\marginnote{7.1} wise cling to nothing, \\
like a droplet on a lotus-leaf. \\
They are happy everywhere, \\
and victorious everywhere. 

There’s\marginnote{8.1} legitimate loss, \\
and there’s illegitimate gain. \\
Legitimate loss is better \\
than illegitimate gain. 

There’s\marginnote{9.1} the fame of the unintelligent, \\
and there’s the disrepute of the discerning. \\
The disrepute of the discerning is better \\
than the fame of the unintelligent. 

There’s\marginnote{10.1} praise by simpletons, \\
and there’s criticism by the discerning. \\
Criticism by the discerning is better \\
than praise by fools. 

There’s\marginnote{11.1} the happiness of sensual pleasures, \\
and there’s the suffering of seclusion. \\
The suffering of seclusion is better \\
than the happiness of sensual pleasures. 

There’s\marginnote{12.1} life without principles, \\
and there’s death with principles. \\
Death with principles is better \\
than life without principles. 

Those\marginnote{13.1} who’ve given up desire and anger, \\
their minds at peace \\>regarding rebirth in this or that state, \\
wander in the world unattached, \\
for them nothing is beloved or unloved. 

Having\marginnote{14.1} developed the awakening factors, \\
the faculties and the powers, \\
having arrived at ultimate peace, \\
the undefiled become fully quenched.

“My\marginnote{1.1} confidence grew \\

attractive, provoking lust. 

Just\marginnote{3.1} as a rain cloud would settle \\

All\marginnote{5.1} conditions are suffering—\\

All\marginnote{6.1} things are not-self—\\

“The\marginnote{7.1} senior monk who was awakened \\>right after the Buddha,\footnote{The first two lines of this verse extolling \textsanskrit{Koṇḍañña} were spoken by \textsanskrit{Vaṅgīsa} at \href{https://suttacentral.net/sn8.9/en/sujato\#3.1}{SN 8.9:3.1} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/thag21.1/en/sujato\#38.1}{Thag 21.1:38.1}. } \\
\textsanskrit{Koṇḍañña}, is keenly energetic. \\
He has given up birth and death, \\

“There\marginnote{8.1} are floods, snares, and strong posts, \\

snapping the posts and snares, \\
breaking the mountain so hard to break, \\
crossing over to the far shore, \\
a meditator is freed from \textsanskrit{Māra}’s bonds. 

When\marginnote{9.1} a mendicant is haughty and fickle, \\

they sink down in the great flood, \\

eating and drinking in moderation—\\

Awakened\marginnote{1.1} as a human being, \\
self-tamed and immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi}, \\
following the spiritual path, \\
he loves peace of mind. 

Revered\marginnote{2.1} by people, \\
gone beyond all things, \\
even the gods revere him; \\
so I’ve heard from the perfected one. 

He\marginnote{3.1} has transcended all fetters, \\
and escaped from entanglements. \\
Delighting to renounce sensual pleasures, \\
he’s freed like lustrous gold from stone. 

That\marginnote{4.1} giant outshines all, \\
like the Himalaya beside other mountains. \\
Of all those named “giant”, \\
he is truly named, supreme. 

I\marginnote{5.1} shall extol the giant for you, \\
for he does nothing monstrous. \\
Sweetness and harmlessness \\
are two feet of the giant. 

Mindfulness\marginnote{6.1} and awareness \\
are his two other feet. \\
Faith is the giant’s trunk, \\
and equanimity his white tusks. 

Mindfulness\marginnote{7.1} is his neck, his head is wisdom—\\
investigation and thinking about principles. \\
His belly is the sacred hearth of the Dhamma, \\
and his tail is seclusion. 

Practicing\marginnote{8.1} absorption, enjoying the breath, \\
he is serene within. \\
The giant is serene when walking, \\
the giant is serene when standing, 

the\marginnote{9.1} giant is serene when lying down, \\
and when sitting, the giant is serene. \\
The giant is restrained everywhere: \\
this is the accomplishment of the giant. 

He\marginnote{10.1} eats blameless things, \\
he doesn’t eat blameworthy things. \\
When he gets food and clothes, \\
he avoids storing them up. 

Having\marginnote{11.1} severed all bonds, \\
fetters large and small, \\
wherever he goes, \\
he goes without concern. 

A\marginnote{12.1} white lotus, \\
fragrant and delightful, \\
sprouts in water and grows there, \\
but the water doesn’t cling to it. 

Just\marginnote{13.1} so the Buddha is born in the world, \\
and lives in the world, \\
but the world doesn’t stick to him, \\
as water does not stick to the lotus. 

A\marginnote{14.1} great blazing fire \\
dies down when the fuel runs out. \\
And when the coals have gone out \\
it’s said to be “quenched”. 

This\marginnote{15.1} simile is taught by the discerning \\
to express the meaning clearly. \\
Great giants will understand \\
what the giant taught the giant. 

Free\marginnote{16.1} of greed, free of hate, \\
free of delusion, undefiled; \\
the giant, giving up his body, \\
undefiled, will be fully quenched.

Why don’t you cry out \\
in such a terrifying situation?” 

“There\marginnote{3.1} isn’t any mental suffering \\

All fears are left behind \\
by one whose fetters have ended. 

When\marginnote{4.1} the conduit to rebirth is ended, \\

there is no fear of death; \\
it’s like laying down a burden. 

I’ve\marginnote{5.1} lived the spiritual life well, \\

I do not fear death; \\
it’s like the passing of a disease. 

I’ve\marginnote{6.1} lived the spiritual life well, \\

One\marginnote{7.1} who has gone beyond, without grasping, \\

Whatever\marginnote{9.1} has come to pass, \\
wherever life is obtained, \\

It\marginnote{11.1} doesn’t occur to me, ‘I existed in the past’; \\

All conditions will disappear—\\
why weep over that? 

Seeing\marginnote{12.1} truly \\
the bare arising of phenomena, \\
and the bare process of conditions, \\
there is no fear, village chief. 

The\marginnote{13.1} world is like grass and sticks: \\
when this is seen with wisdom, \\
not finding anything to be mine, \\
you won’t grieve, thinking ‘I don’t have it’. 

I’m\marginnote{14.1} fed up with the body; \\
I have no need for another life. \\
This body will be broken up, \\

I won’t be angry or attached \\
on account of that.” 

When\marginnote{16.1} they heard these words, \\
so astonishing and hair-raising, \\
the young men laid down their swords \\
and spoke these words: 

“What\marginnote{17.1} have you practiced, Venerable? \\
And who is your tutor? \\
Whose instructions do we follow \\
to gain the sorrowless state?” 

“The\marginnote{18.1} knower of all, the seer of all: \\
the victor is my tutor. \\
He is a Teacher of great compassion, \\
healer of the whole world. 

He\marginnote{19.1} taught this Dhamma, \\
leading to ending, unsurpassed. \\
Following his instructions, \\
you can gain the sorrowless state.” 

When\marginnote{20.1} the bandits heard the good words of the seer, \\
they laid down their swords and weapons. \\
Some refrained from their former deeds, \\
while others chose the going-forth. 

Having\marginnote{21.1} gone forth in the teaching of the Holy One, \\
those astute ones developed \\>the awakening factors and the powers. \\
Elated, happy, their faculties complete, \\
they realized the state of extinguishment, the unconditioned.

\begin{verse}%
This\marginnote{1.1} thought came to the ascetic, \\
the monk \textsanskrit{Pārāsariya}, \\
as he was seated alone \\
meditating in seclusion: 

“Following\marginnote{2.1} what procedure, \\
what observance, what conduct, \\
may a person do what they need for themselves, \\
without harming anyone else? 

The\marginnote{3.1} faculties of human beings \\
can lead to both welfare and harm. \\
Unguarded they lead to harm; \\
guarded they lead to welfare. 

By\marginnote{4.1} protecting the faculties, \\
taking care of the faculties, \\
I can do what I need for myself \\
without harming anyone else. 

If\marginnote{5.1} your eye wanders \\
among sights without check, \\
not seeing the danger, \\
you’re not freed from suffering. 

If\marginnote{6.1} your ear wanders \\
among sounds without check, \\
not seeing the danger, \\
you’re not freed from suffering. 

If,\marginnote{7.1} not seeing the escape, \\
you indulge in a smell, \\
you’re not freed from suffering, \\
being besotted by smells. 

Recollecting\marginnote{8.1} the sour, \\
the sweet and the bitter, \\
captivated by craving for taste, \\
you don’t understand the heart. 

Recollecting\marginnote{9.1} lovely \\
and pleasurable touches, \\
full of desire, you experience \\
many kinds of suffering because of lust. 

Unable\marginnote{10.1} to protect \\
the mind from such thoughts, \\
suffering follows them \\
because of all five. 

This\marginnote{11.1} body is full of pus and blood, \\
it’s home to many carcasses; \\
but cunning people decorate it \\
like a lovely painted casket. 

You\marginnote{12.1} don’t understand that \\
the sweetness of honey turns bitter, \\
and the bonds to those we love cause pain, \\
like a razor’s edge smeared with honey. 

Full\marginnote{13.1} of lust for the sight of a woman, \\
for the voice and the smells of a woman, \\
for a woman’s touch, \\
you experience many kinds of suffering. 

All\marginnote{14.1} of a woman’s streams \\
flow from five to five. \\
Whoever, being energetic, \\
is able to curb these, 

purposeful\marginnote{15.1} and firm in principle, \\
is clever and clear-seeing. \\
Though he might enjoy himself, \\
his duty is connected with the teaching and its goal. 

One\marginnote{16.1} who’s diligent and discerning, \\
thinking, “This ought not be done”, \\
would avoid a useless task \\
that’s doomed to failure. 

Whatever\marginnote{17.1} is meaningful, \\
and whatever happiness is principled, \\
let one undertake and follow that: \\
this is the best happiness. 

They\marginnote{18.1} want to get hold of what belongs to others \\
by any means, fair or foul. \\
They kill, injure, and torment, \\
violently plundering what belongs to others. 

Just\marginnote{19.1} as a strong person when building \\
knocks out a peg with a peg, \\
so the skillful person \\
knocks out the faculties with the faculties. 

Developing\marginnote{20.1} faith, energy, immersion, \\
mindfulness, and wisdom; \\
destroying the five with the five, \\
the brahmin walks on untroubled. 

Purposeful\marginnote{21.1} and firm in principle, \\
having fulfilled in every respect \\
the instructions spoken by the Buddha, \\
that person prospers in happiness.”

\begin{verse}%
For\marginnote{1.1} a long time, sadly, \\
though I keenly contemplated the teaching, \\
I gained no peace of mind. \\
So I asked this of ascetics and brahmins: 

“Who\marginnote{2.1} in the world have crossed over? \\
Whose attainment culminates in freedom from death? \\
Whose teaching do I accept \\
to understand the ultimate goal? 

I\marginnote{3.1} was hooked inside, \\
like a fish gulping bait; \\
bound like the titan Vepaciti \\
in Mahinda’s trap.\footnote{Mahinda (“Great Indra”) is a name of Sakka, the nemesis of Vepaciti. } 

Dragging\marginnote{4.1} it along, I’m not free \\
from grief and lamentation. \\
Who will free me from bonds in the world, \\
so that I may know awakening? 

What\marginnote{5.1} ascetic or brahmin \\
points out what is frail? \\
Whose teaching do I accept \\
to sweep away old age and death? 

Tied\marginnote{6.1} up with uncertainty and doubt, \\
secured by the power of aggression, \\
stiff as a mind beset by anger; \\
the arrow of covetousness, 

propelled\marginnote{7.1} by the bow of craving, \\
is stuck in my twice-fifteen ribcage—\footnote{The commentary explains “twice-fifteen” as the twenty kinds of substantialist view and ten kinds of wrong view. This is implausible, as it clearly has an organic sense. I count it as 24 ribs, plus two bones each for the collar-bones, the shoulder-blades, and the sternum, making thirty in total. The sternum is technically one bone, but it is divided into upper (manubrium) and lower (gladiolus) with a notch between. } \\
see how it stands in my breast, \\
breaking my strong heart. 

Speculative\marginnote{8.1} views are not abandoned, \\
they are sharpened by memories and intentions;\footnote{Read \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅkappasara}} per PTS for MS’s \textit{\textsanskrit{saṅkappapara}}. } \\
and pierced by this I tremble, \\
like a leaf blowing in the gale. 

Having\marginnote{9.1} arisen within, \\
what belongs to me burns quickly, \\
in that place where the body always heads \\
with its six sense-fields of contact. 

I\marginnote{10.1} don’t see a healer \\
who can pull out my dart of doubt \\
without a lance \\
or some other blade. 

Without\marginnote{11.1} knife or wound, \\
who will pull out this dart \\
that’s stuck inside me, \\
without harming any part of my body? 

He\marginnote{12.1} really would be the Lord of the Dhamma, \\
the best one to cure the damage of poison; \\
when I have fallen into deep waters, \\
he would show me his hand and the shore. 

I’ve\marginnote{13.1} plunged into a lake, \\
and I can’t wash off the mud and dirt. \\
It’s full of fraud, jealousy, aggression, \\
and dullness and drowsiness. 

Like\marginnote{14.1} a thunder-cloud of restlessness, \\
like a rain cloud of fetters; \\
lustful thoughts are winds \\
that sweep off a person with bad views. 

The\marginnote{15.1} streams flow everywhere; \\
a weed springs up and remains. \\
Who will block the streams? \\
Who will cut the weed?” 

“Venerable\marginnote{16.1} sir, build a dam \\
to block the streams. \\
Don’t let your mind-made streams \\
cut you down suddenly like a tree.” 

That\marginnote{17.1} is how, when I was full of fear, \\
seeking the far shore from the near, \\
my shelter was the teacher \\>whose weapon is wisdom, \\
surrounded by the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of seers. 

As\marginnote{18.1} I was being swept away, \\
he gave me a strong, simple ladder, \\
made of the heartwood of Dhamma, \\
and he said to me: “Do not fear.” 

I\marginnote{19.1} climbed the tower of mindfulness meditation, \\
and checked back down \\
at people delighting in substantial reality, \\
as I had obsessed over in the past. 

When\marginnote{20.1} I saw the path, \\
as I was embarking on the ship, \\
without fixating on the self, \\
I saw the supreme landing-place. 

The\marginnote{21.1} dart that arises in oneself, \\
and that which stems from the conduit to rebirth: \\
he taught the supreme path \\
for the canceling of these. 

For\marginnote{22.1} a long time it had lain within me; \\
for a long time it was fixed in me: \\
the Buddha cast off the knot, \\
curing the damage of poison.

“See\marginnote{1.1} this fancy puppet, \\
a body built of sores, \\
diseased, obsessed over, \\
in which nothing lasts at all. 

See\marginnote{2.1} this fancy figure, \\
with its gems and earrings; \\
it is bones encased in skin, \\
made pretty by its clothes. 

Rouged\marginnote{3.1} feet \\
and powdered face \\
may be enough to beguile a fool, \\

The\marginnote{7.1} hunter’s snare is broken, \\
but the deer didn’t spring the trap. \\
I’ve eaten the bait and now I go, \\
leaving the deer-hunter to grieve.” 

“I\marginnote{8.1} see rich people in the world who, \\
because of delusion, give not the money they’ve earned. \\
Greedily, they hoard their riches, \\
yearning for ever more sensual pleasures. 

A\marginnote{9.1} king who conquered the earth by force, \\
ruling the land from sea to sea, \\
unsatisfied with the near shore of the ocean, \\
would still yearn for the further shore. 

Not\marginnote{10.1} just the king, but others too, \\
reach death not rid of craving. \\
They leave the body still wanting, \\
for in this world sensual pleasures never satisfy. 

Relatives\marginnote{11.1} lament, their hair disheveled, \\
saying ‘Ah! Alas! They’re not immortal!’ \\
They take out the body wrapped in a shroud, \\
heap up a pyre, and burn it there. 

It’s\marginnote{12.1} poked with stakes while being burnt, \\
in just a single cloth, all wealth gone. \\
Relatives, friends, and companions \\
can’t help you when you’re dying. 

Heirs\marginnote{13.1} take your riches, \\
while beings fare on according to their deeds. \\
Riches don’t follow you when you die; \\
nor do children, wife, wealth, nor kingdom. 

Longevity\marginnote{14.1} isn’t gained by riches, \\
nor does wealth banish old age; \\
for the attentive say this life is short, \\
it’s perishable and not eternal. 

The\marginnote{15.1} rich and the poor feel its touch; \\
the fool and the attentive one feel it too. \\
But the fool lies stricken by their own folly, \\
while the attentive don’t tremble at the touch. 

Therefore\marginnote{16.1} wisdom’s much better than wealth, \\
since by wisdom \\>you reach consummation in this life. \\
But if because of delusion \\>you don’t reach consummation, \\
you’ll do evil deeds in life after life. 

One\marginnote{17.1} who enters a womb and the world beyond, \\
will transmigrate from one life to the next. \\
While someone of little wisdom, \\>placing faith in them, \\
also enters a womb and the world beyond. 

As\marginnote{18.1} a bandit caught in a window \\
is punished for his own bad deeds; \\
so after departing, in the world beyond, \\
people are punished for their own bad deeds. 

Sensual\marginnote{19.1} pleasures are diverse, sweet, delightful, \\
appearing in disguise they disturb the mind. \\
Seeing danger in sensual stimulations, \\
I went forth, O King. 

As\marginnote{20.1} fruit falls from a tree, so people fall, \\
young and old, when the body breaks up. \\
Seeing this, too, I went forth, O King; \\
the ascetic life is unfailingly better.” 

“I\marginnote{21.1} went forth out of faith \\
joining the victor’s dispensation. \\
My going forth wasn’t wasted; \\
I enjoy my food free of debt. 

I\marginnote{22.1} saw sensual pleasures as burning, \\
gold as a cutting blade, \\
conception in a womb as suffering, \\
and the hells as very fearful. 

Knowing\marginnote{23.1} this danger, \\
I was struck with a sense of urgency. \\
I was stabbed, but then I found peace, \\
attaining the end of defilements. 

I’ve\marginnote{24.1} served the teacher \\
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions. \\
The heavy burden is laid down, \\
the conduit to rebirth is eradicated. 

I’ve\marginnote{25.1} reached the goal \\
for the sake of which I went forth \\
from the lay life to homelessness—\\
the ending of all fetters.”

golden colored, \\
with teeth so white; you’re strong.

of a handsome man, \\
the marks of a great man, \\
are all found on your body. 

Your\marginnote{3.1} eyes are clear, your face is fair, \\
you’re formidable, sincere, majestic. \\
In the midst of the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of ascetics, \\
you shine like the sun. 

You’re\marginnote{4.1} a mendicant fine to see, \\
with skin that shines like lustrous gold. \\
But with such excellent appearance, \\
what do you want with the ascetic life? 

You’re\marginnote{5.1} fit to be a king, \\
a wheel-turning monarch, chief of charioteers, \\
victorious in the four quarters, \\
lord of the Black Plum Tree Land. 

Aristocrats,\marginnote{6.1} nobles, and kings \\
ought follow your rule. \\
Gotama, you should reign \\
as king of kings, lord of men!” 

“I\marginnote{7.1} am a king, Sela”, \\
\scspeaker{said the Buddha to Sela, }\\
“the supreme king of the teaching. \\
By the teaching I roll forth the wheel \\
which cannot be rolled back.”\footnote{This is of course a reference to the first sermon (\href{https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11/en/sujato}{SN 56.11}). } 

“You\marginnote{8.1} claim to be awakened,” \\
\scspeaker{said Sela the brahmin, }\\
“the supreme king of the teaching. \\
‘I roll forth the teaching’: \\
so you say, Gotama. 

Then\marginnote{9.1} who is your general,\footnote{The title “General of the Dhamma” belongs to \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} (\href{https://suttacentral.net/ud2.8/en/sujato\#16.2}{Ud 2.8:16.2}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/thag18.1/en/sujato\#33.1}{Thag 18.1:33.1}). } \\
the disciple who follows the Teacher’s way? \\
Who keeps rolling the wheel \\
of the teaching you rolled forth?” 

“By\marginnote{10.1} me the wheel was rolled forth,” \\
\scspeaker{said the Buddha, }\\
“the supreme wheel of the teaching. \\
\textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, taking after the Realized One, \\
keeps it rolling on.\footnote{\textit{\textsanskrit{Anujāta}} is said at \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti74/en/sujato\#4.1}{Iti 74:4.1} to be a child who “takes after” the good qualities of their parents. } 

I\marginnote{11.1} have known what should be known,\footnote{As at \href{https://suttacentral.net/mn91/en/sujato\#31.5}{MN 91:31.5}. } \\
and developed what should be developed, \\
and given up what should be given up: \\
and so, brahmin, I am a Buddha. 

Dispel\marginnote{12.1} your doubt in me—\\
make up your mind, brahmin! \\
The sight of a Buddha \\
is hard to find again.\footnote{\textit{\textsanskrit{Abhiṇhaso}} means “repeatedly”. Here the force of the saying is, I think, “It is hard enough to encounter a Buddha even once, let alone repeatedly.” } 

I\marginnote{13.1} am a Buddha, brahmin, \\
the supreme surgeon, \\
one of those whose appearance in the world \\
is hard to find again. 

A\marginnote{14.1} manifestation of divinity, unequaled, \\
crusher of \textsanskrit{Māra}’s army; \\
having subdued all my opponents, \\
I rejoice, fearing nothing from any quarter.” 

“Pay\marginnote{15.1} heed, sirs, to what \\
is spoken by the Clear-eyed One. \\
The surgeon, the great hero, \\
roars like a lion in the jungle. 

A\marginnote{16.1} manifestation of divinity, unequaled, \\
crusher of \textsanskrit{Māra}’s army; \\
who would not be inspired by him, \\
even one born in a dark class?\footnote{The “dark class” refers to those born in an unfortunate state (\href{https://suttacentral.net/an6.57/en/sujato\#11.1}{AN 6.57:11.1}). Sela is saying that the Buddha’s path is for everyone, not just the fortunate. } 

Those\marginnote{17.1} who wish may follow me; \\
those who don’t may go. \\
Right here, I’ll go forth in his presence, \\
the one of such splendid wisdom.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{18.1} if you endorse \\
the teaching of the Buddha, \\
we’ll also go forth in his presence, \\
the one of such splendid wisdom.” 

“These\marginnote{19.1} three hundred brahmins \\
with joined palms held up, ask: \\
‘May we lead the spiritual life \\
in your presence, Blessed One?’” 

“The\marginnote{20.1} spiritual life is well explained,” \\
\scspeaker{said the Buddha, }\\
“apparent in the present life, immediately effective. \\
Here the going forth isn’t in vain \\
for one who trains with diligence.” 

“This\marginnote{21.1} is the eighth day since \\
we went for refuge, O Clear-eyed One. \\
In these seven days, Blessed One, \\
we’ve become tamed in your teaching. 

You\marginnote{22.1} are the Buddha, you are the Teacher,\footnote{This verse and the next are also at \href{https://suttacentral.net/snp3.6/en/sujato\#49.1}{Snp 3.6:49.1}. } \\
you are the sage who has overcome \textsanskrit{Māra}; \\
you have cut off the underlying tendencies, \\
you’ve crossed over, and you bring humanity across. 

You\marginnote{23.1} have transcended attachments, \\
your defilements are shattered; \\
by not grasping, like a lion, \\
you’ve given up fear and dread. 

These\marginnote{24.1} three hundred mendicants \\
stand with joined palms raised. \\
Stretch out your feet, great hero: \\
let these giants bow to the Teacher.”

“While\marginnote{1.1} walking, ascetic, you say ‘I’ve stopped.’\footnote{The story of \textsanskrit{Aṅgulimāla} is told in more detail in \href{https://suttacentral.net/mn86/en/sujato}{MN 86}, which includes most of the verses found here. } \\
And I have stopped, but you tell me I’ve not. \\
I’m asking you this, ascetic: \\
how is it you’ve stopped and I have not?” 

“\textsanskrit{Aṅgulimāla},\marginnote{2.1} I have forever stopped—\\
I’ve laid aside violence towards all creatures. \\
But you can’t stop yourself \\>from harming living creatures; \\
that’s why I’ve stopped, but you have not.” 

“Oh,\marginnote{3.1} at long last a renowned great seer, \\
an ascetic has followed me into this deep wood. \\
Now that I’ve heard your verse on Dhamma, \\
I shall discard a thousand evils.” 

With\marginnote{4.1} these words, \\>the bandit hurled his sword and weapons \\
down a cliff into an abyss. \\
He venerated the Holy One’s feet, \\
and asked the Buddha for the going forth right away. 

Then\marginnote{5.1} the Buddha, the compassionate great seer, \\
the teacher of the world with its gods, \\
said to him, “Come, monk!” \\
And with that he became a monk. 

“He\marginnote{6.1} who once was heedless, \\
but turned to heedfulness, \\
lights up the world, \\
like the moon freed from clouds. 

Someone\marginnote{7.1} whose bad deed \\
is supplanted by the good, \\
lights up the world, \\
like the moon freed from clouds. 

A\marginnote{8.1} young mendicant \\
devoted to the Buddha’s teaching, \\
lights up the world, \\
like the moon freed from clouds. 

May\marginnote{9.1} even my enemies \\>hear a Dhamma talk! \\
May even my enemies \\>devote themselves to the Buddha’s teaching! \\
May even my enemies \\>associate with those good people \\
who establish others in the Dhamma! 

May\marginnote{10.1} even my enemies \\>hear Dhamma at the right time, \\
from those who teach acceptance, \\
praising acquiescence; \\
and may they follow that path! 

For\marginnote{11.1} then they’d never wish harm \\
upon myself or others. \\
Having arrived at ultimate peace, \\
they’d look after creatures firm and frail. 

For\marginnote{12.1} irrigators guide the water, \\
and fletchers straighten arrows; \\
carpenters carve timber—\\
but the astute tame themselves. 

Some\marginnote{13.1} tame by using the rod, \\
some with goads, and some with whips. \\
But the unaffected one tamed me \\
without rod or sword. 

My\marginnote{14.1} name is ‘Harmless’, \\
though I used to be harmful. \\
The name I bear today is true, \\
for I do no harm to anyone. 

I\marginnote{15.1} used to be a bandit, \\
the notorious \textsanskrit{Aṅgulimāla}. \\
Swept away in a great flood, \\
I went to the Buddha for refuge. 

I\marginnote{16.1} used to have blood on my hands, \\
the notorious \textsanskrit{Aṅgulimāla}. \\
See the refuge I’ve found—\\
the conduit to rebirth is eradicated. 

I’ve\marginnote{17.1} done many of the sort of deeds \\
that lead to a bad destination. \\
The result of my deeds has already struck me, \\
so I enjoy my food free of debt. 

Fools\marginnote{18.1} and simpletons \\
devote themselves to negligence. \\
But the wise protect diligence \\
as their best treasure. 

Don’t\marginnote{19.1} devote yourself to negligence, \\
or delight in erotic intimacy. \\
For if you’re diligent and practice absorption, \\
you’ll attain ultimate happiness. 

It\marginnote{20.1} was welcome, not unwelcome, \\
the advice I got was good. \\
Of the well-explained teachings, \\
I arrived at the best. 

It\marginnote{21.1} was welcome, not unwelcome, \\
the advice I got was good. \\
I’ve attained the three knowledges, \\
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.” 

“In\marginnote{22.1} the wilderness, at a tree’s root,\footnote{The following verses are not found in \href{https://suttacentral.net/mn86/en/sujato}{MN 86}. } \\
on mountains, or in caves—\\
it used to be that wherever I stood, \\
my mind was anxious. 

But\marginnote{23.1} now I lie down happily and stand up happily, \\
I live my life happily, \\
out of \textsanskrit{Māra}’s reach; \\
the teacher had sympathy for me. 

I\marginnote{24.1} used to be of brahmin birth, \\
highborn on both sides, \\
now I’m a son of the Holy One, \\
the Teacher, King of Dhamma. 

I\marginnote{25.1} am rid of craving, free of grasping, \\
my sense doors are guarded and well-restrained. \\
I’ve destroyed the root of misery, \\
and attained the ending of defilements. 

I’ve\marginnote{26.1} served the teacher \\
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions. \\
The heavy burden is laid down, \\
the conduit to rebirth is eradicated.”

\begin{verse}%
Leaving\marginnote{1.1} my mother and father behind, \\
as well as sisters, kinsmen, and brothers; \\
having given up the five sensual titillations, \\
Anuruddha practices absorption. 

Surrounded\marginnote{2.1} by song and dance, \\
awakened by cymbals and gongs, \\
he did not find purification \\
while delighting in \textsanskrit{Māra}’s domain. 

But\marginnote{3.1} he has gone beyond all that, \\
and delights in the Buddha’s teaching. \\
Having crossed over the entire flood, \\
Anuruddha practices absorption. 

Sights,\marginnote{4.1} sounds, tastes, smells, \\
and touches so delightful: \\
having crossed over these as well, \\
Anuruddha practices absorption. 

Returning\marginnote{5.1} from almsround, \\
alone, without companion, \\
seeking rags from the dust heap, \\
Anuruddha is without defilements. 

The\marginnote{6.1} thoughtful sage \\
selected rags from the dust heap; \\
he picked them up, washed, dyed, and wore them; \\
Anuruddha is without defilements. 

The\marginnote{7.1} principles of someone \\
who has many wishes and is not content, \\
who socializes and is conceited, \\
are wicked and corrupting. 

But\marginnote{8.1} someone who is mindful, few of wishes, \\
content and untroubled, \\
delighting in seclusion, joyful, \\
always resolute and energetic; 

their\marginnote{9.1} principles are skillful, \\
leading to awakening; \\
they are without defilements—\\
so said the great seer. 

“Knowing\marginnote{10.1} my thoughts, \\
the supreme Teacher in the world \\
came to me in a mind-made body, \\
using his psychic power. 

He\marginnote{11.1} taught me more \\
than I had thought of. \\
The Buddha who loves non-proliferation \\
taught me non-proliferation. 

Understanding\marginnote{12.1} that teaching, \\
I happily did his bidding. \\
I’ve attained the three knowledges, \\
and have fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions. 

For\marginnote{13.1} the last fifty-five years \\
I have not lain down to sleep. \\
Twenty-five years have passed \\
since I eradicated drowsiness.” 

“There\marginnote{14.1} was no more breathing \\
for the unaffected one of steady heart. \\
Imperturbable, committed to peace, \\
the Clear-eyed One was fully quenched. 

He\marginnote{15.1} put up with painful feelings \\
without flinching. \\
The liberation of his heart \\
was like the extinguishing of a lamp.” 

“Now\marginnote{16.1} these touches and the other four \\
are the last to be experienced by the sage; \\
nor will there be other phenomena \\
since the Buddha was fully quenched. 

O\marginnote{17.1} Penelope, weaver of the web—\\
there’s no more abodes in the host of gods. \\
Transmigration through births is finished, \\
now there’ll be no more future lives.” 

“The\marginnote{18.1} mendicant by whom the galaxy \\
with the age of the Divinity are known in an hour—\\
that master of psychic ability sees the gods \\
at the time they pass away and are reborn.” 

“In\marginnote{19.1} the past I was \textsanskrit{Annabhāra}, \\
a poor carrier of fodder. \\
I practiced as an ascetic, \\
the renowned \textsanskrit{Upariṭṭha}. 

Then\marginnote{20.1} I was reborn in the Sakyan clan, \\
where I was known as ‘Anuruddha’. \\
Surrounded by song and dance, \\
I was awakened by cymbals and gongs. 

Then\marginnote{21.1} I saw the Buddha, \\
the Teacher, fearing nothing from any quarter; \\
filling my mind with confidence in him, \\
I went forth to homelessness. 

I\marginnote{22.1} know my past lives, \\
the places I used to live. \\
I was born as Sakka, \\
and stayed among the thirty-three gods. 

Seven\marginnote{23.1} times I was a king of men \\
ruling a kingdom, \\
victorious in the four quarters, \\
lord of the Black Plum Tree Land. \\
Without rod or sword, \\
I governed by principle. 

Seven\marginnote{24.1} from here, seven from there—\\
fourteen transmigrations in all. \\
I shall remember my past lives: \\
at that time I stayed in the realm of the gods. 

I\marginnote{25.1} have gained complete tranquility \\
in immersion with five factors. \\
Peaceful, serene, \\
my clairvoyance is purified. 

Steady\marginnote{26.1} in five-factored absorption, \\
I know the passing away and rebirth of beings, \\
their coming and going, \\
their lives in this state and that. 

I’ve\marginnote{27.1} served the teacher \\
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions. \\
The heavy burden is laid down, \\
the conduit to rebirth is eradicated. 

In\marginnote{28.1} the Vajjian village of \textsanskrit{Veḷuva}, \\
my life will come to an end. \\
Beneath a thicket of bamboos, \\
being undefiled, I will be fully extinguished.”

\begin{verse}%
This\marginnote{1.1} thought came to the ascetic \\
in the forest full of flowers, \\
as he was seated alone \\
meditating in seclusion: 

“The\marginnote{2.1} behavior of the mendicants \\
these days seems different \\
from when the protector of the world, \\
the best of men, was still here. 

Their\marginnote{3.1} robes were only for covering the private parts, \\
and protection from the cold and wind. \\
They ate in moderation, \\
content with whatever they were offered. 

Whether\marginnote{4.1} food was fine or coarse, \\
a little or a lot, \\
they ate only for sustenance, \\
without greed or gluttony. 

They\marginnote{5.1} weren’t so very eager \\
for the requisites of life, \\
such as tonics and other necessities, \\
as they were for the ending of defilements. 

In\marginnote{6.1} the wilderness, at a tree’s root, \\
in caves and caverns, \\
fostering seclusion, \\
they lived with that as their final goal. 

They\marginnote{7.1} were used to simple things, unburdensome, \\
gentle, not pompous at heart, \\
unsullied, not scurrilous, \\
their thoughts were intent on the goal. 

That’s\marginnote{8.1} why they inspired confidence, \\
in their movements, eating, and practice; \\
their deportment was as smooth \\
as a stream of oil. 

With\marginnote{9.1} the utter ending of all defilements, \\
those senior monks have now been quenched. \\
They were great meditators and great benefactors—\\
there are few like them today. 

With\marginnote{10.1} the ending \\
of good principles and understanding, \\
the victor’s teaching, \\
full of all excellent qualities, has fallen apart. 

This\marginnote{11.1} is the season \\
for bad principles and defilements. \\
Those who are ready for seclusion \\
are all that’s left of the true Dhamma. 

As\marginnote{12.1} they grow, the defilements \\
possess most people; \\
they play with fools, it seems to me, \\
like monsters with the mad. 

Overcome\marginnote{13.1} by defilements, \\
they run here and there \\
among the bases for defilement, \\
as if they had declared war on themselves. 

Having\marginnote{14.1} forsaken the true teaching, \\
they argue with each other.\footnote{\textit{\textsanskrit{Bhaṇḍare}} is reflexive third plural present. } \\
Following wrong views \\
they think, ‘This is better.’ 

They\marginnote{15.1} cut off their wealth, \\
children, and wife to go forth. \\
But then they do what they shouldn’t, \\
for the sake of a measly spoon of almsfood. 

They\marginnote{16.1} eat until their bellies are full, \\
and then they lie to sleep on their backs. \\
When they wake up, they keep on chatting, \\
the kind of talk that the teacher criticized. 

Valuing\marginnote{17.1} all the arts and crafts, \\
they train themselves in them. \\
Not being settled inside, they think, \\
‘This is the goal of the ascetic life.’ 

They\marginnote{18.1} provide clay, oil, and talcum powder, \\
water, lodgings, and food \\
for householders, \\
expecting more in return. 

And\marginnote{19.1} in addition, tooth-picks, portia flowers, \\
flowers, food to eat, \\
well-cooked almsfood, \\
mangoes and myrobalans. 

In\marginnote{20.1} medicine they are like doctors, \\
in business like householders, \\
in makeup like prostitutes, \\
in sovereignty like lords. 

Cheats,\marginnote{21.1} frauds, \\
false witnesses, sly: \\
using multiple plans, \\
they enjoy things of the flesh. 

Pursuing\marginnote{22.1} shams, contrivances, and plans, \\
by such means \\
they accumulate a lot of wealth \\
for the sake of their own livelihood. 

They\marginnote{23.1} assemble the community \\
for business rather than Dhamma. \\
They teach the Dhamma to others \\
for gain, not for the goal. 

Those\marginnote{24.1} barred from the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} \\
quarrel over the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}’s property. \\
Lacking conscience, they do not care \\
that they live on the earnings of others. 

Some\marginnote{25.1} with shaven head and robe \\
are not devoted to practice, \\
but wish only to be honored, \\
besotted with property and reverence. 

When\marginnote{26.1} things have come to this, \\
it’s not easy these days \\
to realize what has not yet been realized, \\
or to preserve what has been realized. 

When\marginnote{27.1} shoeless on a thorny path, \\
one would walk \\
very mindfully; \\
that’s how a sage should walk in the village. 

Remembering\marginnote{28.1} the meditators of old, \\
and recollecting their conduct, \\
even in the latter days, \\
it’s still possible to realize freedom from death.” 

That\marginnote{29.1} is what the ascetic, whose faculties \\
were fully developed, said in the \textsanskrit{sāl} tree grove. \\
The brahmin, the seer, became fully extinguished, \\
putting an end to all future lives.

Seeing\marginnote{1.1} many who inspire confidence, \\
evolved and well-restrained, \\
the seer of the \textsanskrit{Paṇḍara} clan,\footnote{No \textit{\textsanskrit{paṇḍara}} clan is known elsewhere. Given that the text goes on to discuss robe colors of mendicants, the name, which means “white”, probably refers to ascetics wearing white robes, the \textit{\textsanskrit{pāṇḍarabhikṣu}} of Yaśomitra’s \textsanskrit{Sphuṭārthā} \textsanskrit{Abhidharmakośavyākhyā} 300 and \textsanskrit{Mahāvyutpatti} 179. Soma is exalted as “white-robed” (\textit{\textsanskrit{pāṇḍaravāsa}}) at \textsanskrit{Bṛhadāraṇyaka} \textsanskrit{Upaniṣad} 2.1.3. } \\
asked the one known as Phussa: 

“In\marginnote{2.1} future times, \\
what desire and motivation \\
and behavior will people have? \\
Please answer my question.” 

“Listen\marginnote{3.1} to my words, \\
O seer known as a \textsanskrit{Paṇḍara}, \\
and remember them carefully, \\
I will describe the future. 

In\marginnote{4.1} the future many will be \\
angry and hostile, \\
offensive, stubborn, and devious, \\
jealous, holding divergent views. 

Imagining\marginnote{5.1} they understand \\>the depths of the teaching, \\
they resort to the near shore. \\
Superficial and disrespectful towards the teaching, \\
they lack respect for one another. 

In\marginnote{6.1} the future \\
many dangers will arise in the world. \\
Idiots will defile \\
the Dhamma that was taught so well. 

Though\marginnote{7.1} bereft of good qualities, \\
unlearned prattlers, too sure of themselves, \\
will become powerful \\
in running \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} proceedings.\footnote{This is probably an indirect reference to the Second Council, where one of the difficulties was ensuring the proceedings were carried out by monks on integrity. } 

Though\marginnote{8.1} possessing good qualities, \\
the conscientious and unbiased, \\>acting in the proper spirit, \\
will become weak \\

currency and gold,\footnote{Another reference to the Second Council, whose primary issue was the use of money by monastics. } \\
fields and land, goats and sheep, \\
and bonded servants, male and female. 

Fools\marginnote{10.1} looking for fault in others, \\
but unsteady in their own ethics, \\
will wander about, insolent, \\
like cantankerous beasts. 

They’ll\marginnote{11.1} be haughty, \\
wrapped in robes of blue;\footnote{The \textsanskrit{Śāriputraparipṛcchā} (T24, no. 1465, 900.c18) says that the \textsanskrit{Mahīśāsaka} school wore blue robes. They were probably based in \textsanskrit{Mahissatī}, which is close by the kingdom of the \textsanskrit{Pāṇḍyas}. Perhaps this sutta records tensions in the early community of the southern region, leading to the formation of distinct groups of monastics differentiated by their robe colors. } \\
deceivers and flatterers, pompous and fake, \\
they’ll wander as if they were noble ones. 

With\marginnote{12.1} hair sleeked back with oil, \\
fickle, their eyes painted with eye-liner, \\
they’ll travel on the high-road, \\
wrapped in robes of ivory color. 

The\marginnote{13.1} deep-dyed ocher robe, \\
worn without disgust by the free, \\
they will come to loathe, \\
besotted by white clothes.\footnote{Text here uses \textit{\textsanskrit{odāta}} rather than \textit{\textsanskrit{paṇḍara}} for “white”. } 

They’ll\marginnote{14.1} want lots of possessions, \\
and be lazy, lacking energy. \\
Weary of the forest, \\
they’ll stay within villages. 

Being\marginnote{15.1} unrestrained, they’ll keep company with \\
those who acquire profit, \\
and who always enjoy wrong livelihood, \\
following their example. 

They\marginnote{16.1} won’t respect those \\
who don’t get lots of stuff, \\
and they won’t associate with the attentive, \\
even though they’re very amiable. 

Disparaging\marginnote{17.1} their own banner,\footnote{\textit{Milakkhu} (Sanskrit \textit{mleccha}) has the sense “copper-colored”, “vermillion” as well as the more common “foreigner”. } \\
dyed a vermilion color, \\
some will wear the white banner \\
of those of other religions. 

Then\marginnote{18.1} they’ll have no respect \\
for the ocher robe. \\
The mendicants will not reflect \\
on the nature of the ocher robe. 

This\marginnote{19.1} awful lack of reflection \\
was unthinkable to the elephant, \\
who was overcome by suffering, \\
injured by an arrow strike. 

Then\marginnote{20.1} the six-tusked elephant,\footnote{The “six-tusked” (\textit{chaddanta}) elephant was a mystical beast. The story of how he was struck by an arrow and uttered these verses is told in \href{https://suttacentral.net/ja514/en/sujato}{Ja 514}. } \\
seeing the deep-dyed banner of the perfected ones, \\
straight away spoke these verses \\

The text and commentary here do not specify which verses were spoken by the elephant, so I assume they are the same two mentioned in the \textsanskrit{Jātaka}. } \\
would wear the robe stained in ocher, \\
bereft of self-control and truth: \\
they are not worthy of the ocher robe. 

One\marginnote{22.1} who’s purged all their stains, \\
steady in ethics, \\
possessing truth and self-control: \\
they are truly worthy of the ocher robe.’ 

Devoid\marginnote{23.1} of virtue, a simpleton, \\
wild, doing what they like, \\
their minds astray, indolent: \\
they are not worthy of the ocher robe. 

One\marginnote{24.1} accomplished in ethics, \\
free of greed, serene, \\
their heart’s intention pure: \\
they are truly worthy of the ocher robe. 

The\marginnote{25.1} restless, insolent fool, \\
who has no ethics at all, \\
is worthy of a white robe—\\
what use is an ocher robe for them? 

In\marginnote{26.1} the future, monks and nuns \\
with corrupt hearts, lacking regard for others, \\
will disparage those \\
with hearts of loving-kindness. 

Though\marginnote{27.1} trained in wearing the robe \\
by senior monks, \\
simpletons will not listen, \\
wild, doing what they like. 

With\marginnote{28.1} that kind of attitude to training, \\
those fools won’t respect each other, \\
or take any notice of their mentors, \\
like a wild colt with its charioteer. 

Even\marginnote{29.1} so, in the future, \\
this will be the practice \\
of monks and nuns \\
when the latter days have come. 

Before\marginnote{30.1} this frightening future arrives, \\
be easy to admonish, \\
courteous in speech, \\
and respect one another. 

Have\marginnote{31.1} hearts of love and compassion, \\
and please do keep your precepts. \\
Be energetic, resolute, \\
and always staunchly vigorous. 

Seeing\marginnote{32.1} negligence as fearful, \\
and diligence as a sanctuary, \\
develop the eightfold path, \\
realizing the state free of death.”

\begin{verse}%
“One\marginnote{1.1} who’s mindful \\>as per their conduct and mindfulness, \\
diligent \\>as per their intentions and meditation, \\
happy inside, serene, solitary, contented: \\
that is what they call a mendicant. 

When\marginnote{2.1} eating fresh or dried food, \\
one shouldn’t be overly replete. \\
A mendicant should wander mindfully, \\
with empty stomach, taking limited food. 

Four\marginnote{3.1} or five mouthfuls before you’re full, \\
drink some water; \\
this is enough for a resolute mendicant \\
to live in comfort. 

If\marginnote{4.1} they cover themselves with a robe \\
that’s allowable and fit for purpose; \\
this is enough for a resolute mendicant \\
to live in comfort. 

When\marginnote{5.1} sitting cross-legged, \\
the rain doesn’t fall on the knees; \\
this is enough for a resolute mendicant \\
to live in comfort.” 

“When\marginnote{6.1} you’ve seen happiness as suffering, \\
and suffering as a dart, \\
and that there’s nothing between the two—\\
what keeps you in the world? \\>What would you become? 

Thinking,\marginnote{7.1} ‘May I have nothing to do \\>with those of bad wishes, \\
lazy, lacking energy, \\
unlearned, lacking regard for others’—\\
what keeps you in the world? \\>What would you become?” 

“An\marginnote{8.1} intelligent, learned person, \\
steady in ethics, \\
devoted to serenity of heart—\\
let them stand at the head.” 

“A\marginnote{9.1} beast who likes to proliferate, \\
enjoying proliferation, \\
fails to win extinguishment, \\
the supreme sanctuary from the yoke. 

But\marginnote{10.1} one who gives up proliferation, \\
enjoying the state of non-proliferation, \\
wins extinguishment, \\
the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.” 

“Whether\marginnote{11.1} in the village or the wilderness, \\
in a valley or the uplands, \\
wherever the perfected ones live \\
is a delightful place.” 

“Delightful\marginnote{12.1} are the wildernesses \\
where no people delight. \\
Those free of greed will delight there, \\
not those who seek sensual pleasures.” 

“Regard\marginnote{13.1} one who sees your faults \\
as a guide to a hidden treasure. \\
Stay close to one so wise and astute \\
who corrects you when you need it. \\
Sticking close to such an impartial person, \\
things get better, not worse.” 

“Advise\marginnote{14.1} and instruct; \\
curb wickedness: \\
for you shall be loved by the good, \\
and disliked by the bad.” 

“The\marginnote{15.1} Blessed One, the Buddha, the seer \\
was teaching Dhamma to another. \\
As he taught the Dhamma, \\
I lent an ear to get the meaning. 

My\marginnote{16.1} listening wasn’t wasted: \\
I’m freed, without defilements.” 

“Not\marginnote{17.1} for knowledge of past lives, \\
nor even for clairvoyance; \\
not for psychic powers, \\>or reading the minds of others, \\
nor for knowing people’s \\>passing away and being reborn; \\
not for purifying the power of clairaudience, \\
did I have any wish.” 

“His\marginnote{18.1} only shelter is the foot of a tree; \\
shaven, wrapped in his outer robe, \\
the senior monk foremost in wisdom, \\
Upatissa himself practices absorption. 

When\marginnote{19.1} in a meditation  free of placing the mind, \\
a disciple of the Buddha \\
is at that moment blessed \\
with noble silence. 

As\marginnote{20.1} a rocky mountain \\
is unwavering and well grounded, \\
so when delusion ends, \\
a monk, like a mountain, doesn’t tremble.” 

“To\marginnote{21.1} the man who has not a blemish, \\
who is always seeking purity, \\
even a hair-tip of evil \\
seems as big as a cloud.” 

“I\marginnote{22.1} don’t long for death; \\
I don’t long for life; \\
I will lay down this body, \\
aware and mindful. 

I\marginnote{23.1} don’t long for death; \\
I don’t long for life; \\
I await my time, \\
like a worker waiting for their wages.” 

“Both\marginnote{24.1} what came before and what follows after \\
are nothing but death, not freedom from death. \\
Practice, don’t perish—\\
don’t let the moment pass you by. 

Just\marginnote{25.1} like a frontier city, \\
is guarded inside and out, \\
so you should ward yourselves—\\
don’t let the moment pass you by. \\
For if you miss your moment \\
you’ll grieve when sent to hell.” 

“Calm\marginnote{26.1} and still, \\
thoughtful in counsel, not restless—\\
he shakes off bad qualities \\
as the gale shakes leaves off a tree. 

Calm\marginnote{27.1} and still, \\
thoughtful in counsel, not restless—\\
he plucks off bad qualities \\
as the gale shakes leaves off a tree. 

Calm\marginnote{28.1} and free of despair, \\
clear and unclouded, \\
of good morals, intelligent: \\
one would make an end of suffering.” 

“Some\marginnote{29.1} householders, and even some renunciants, \\
are not to be trusted. \\
Some who were good later become bad; \\
while some who were bad become good.” 

“Sensual\marginnote{30.1} desire, ill will, \\
dullness and drowsiness, \\
restlessness, and doubt: \\
these are the five mental stains for a monk.” 

“Whether\marginnote{31.1} they’re honored \\
or not honored, or both, \\
their immersion doesn’t waver \\
as they live diligently. 

They\marginnote{32.1} persistently practice absorption \\
with subtle view and discernment. \\
Rejoicing in the ending of grasping, \\
they’re said to be a true person.” 

“The\marginnote{33.1} oceans and the earth, \\
the mountains and the wind—\\
no simile can do justice \\
to the Teacher’s magnificent liberation.” 

“The\marginnote{34.1} senior monk who keeps the wheel rolling, \\
he is very wise and serene. \\
Like earth, like water, like fire, \\
he is neither attracted nor repelled. 

He\marginnote{35.1} has attained the perfection of wisdom, \\
so intelligent and thoughtful. \\
He is bright, but seems to be dull; \\
he always wanders, quenched.” 

“I’ve\marginnote{36.1} served the teacher \\
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions. \\
The heavy burden is laid down, \\
the conduit to rebirth is eradicated.” 

“Persist\marginnote{37.1} with diligence: \\
this is my instruction. \\
Come, I’ll be fully quenched—\\
I am everywhere free.”

“The\marginnote{1.1} astute would not make friends \\
with the slanderous or the hateful, \\
with a miser or a gloater, \\
for it’s bad to consort with sinners. 

The\marginnote{2.1} astute would make friends \\
with the faithful and the pleasant, \\
the wise and the learned, \\
for it’s a blessing to consort with true persons.” 

“See\marginnote{3.1} this fancy puppet, \\
a body built of sores, \\
diseased, obsessed over, \\
in which nothing lasts at all. 

See\marginnote{4.1} this fancy puppet, \\
with its gems and earrings; \\
it is bones encased in skin, \\
made pretty by its clothes. 

Rouged\marginnote{5.1} feet \\
and powdered face \\
may be enough to beguile a fool, \\
but not a seeker of the far shore. 

Hair\marginnote{6.1} in eight braids \\
and eyeliner \\
may be enough to beguile a fool, \\
but not a seeker of the far shore. 

A\marginnote{7.1} rotting body all adorned \\
like a freshly painted makeup box \\
may be enough to beguile a fool, \\
but not a seeker of the far shore.” 

“Gotama\marginnote{8.1} is learned, a brilliant speaker, \\
the attendant to the Buddha. \\
With burden put down, detached, \\
Gotama made his bed. 

Defilements\marginnote{9.1} ended, detached, \\
he has got over clinging and become quenched. \\
He bears his final body, \\
having gone beyond birth and death.” 

“Gotama\marginnote{10.1} stands firm \\
on the path that leads to quenching, \\
where the teachings of the Buddha, \\
the kinsman of the Sun, are grounded.” 

“82,000\marginnote{11.1} from the Buddha, \\
and 2,000 more from the monks: \\
84,000 teachings I’ve learned, \\
and these are what I promulgate.” 

“A\marginnote{12.1} person of little learning \\
ages like an ox—\\
their flesh grows, \\
but not their wisdom. 

A\marginnote{13.1} learned person who, on account of their learning, \\
looks down on someone of little learning, \\
strikes me as like \\
a blind man holding a lamp. 

You\marginnote{14.1} should stay close to a learned person—\\
don’t lose what you’ve learned. \\
It is the root of the spiritual life, \\
which is why you should memorize the teaching. 

Knowing\marginnote{15.1} the sequence and meaning of the teaching, \\
expert in the interpretation of terms, \\
they make sure it is well memorized, \\
and then examine the meaning. 

Accepting\marginnote{16.1} the teachings, they become enthusiastic; \\
making an effort, they weigh up the teaching. \\
When it’s time, they strive \\
serene inside themselves. 

If\marginnote{17.1} you want to understand the teaching, \\
you should befriend the sort of person \\
who is learned and has memorized the teachings, \\
a wise disciple of the Buddha. 

One\marginnote{18.1} who is learned \\>and has memorized the teaching, \\
a keeper of the great seer’s treasury, \\
is a visionary for the whole world, \\
learned and honorable. 

Delighting\marginnote{19.1} in the teaching, enjoying the teaching, \\
contemplating the teaching, \\
a mendicant who recollects the teaching \\
doesn’t decline in the true teaching.” 

“When\marginnote{20.1} your body is pampered and heavy, \\
while your remaining time is running out, \\
greedy for physical pleasure, \\
how can you be comfortable as an ascetic?” 

“I’m\marginnote{21.1} completely disorientated! \\
The teachings don’t spring to mind! \\
With the passing of our good friend, \\
everything seems dark. 

When\marginnote{22.1} your friend has passed away, \\
and your Teacher is past and gone, \\
there’s no friend like \\
mindfulness of the body. 

The\marginnote{23.1} old have passed away, \\
and I don’t agree with the new. \\
Today I meditate alone \\
like a bird snug in its nest.” 

“Many\marginnote{24.1} international visitors \\
have come to visit. \\
Don’t block the audience, \\
let the congregation see me.” 

“Lots\marginnote{25.1} of international visitors \\
have come to visit. \\
The teacher grants them the opportunity, \\
the Clear-eyed One doesn’t turn them away.” 

“In\marginnote{26.1} the twenty five years that have passed \\
since I became a trainee, \\
no sensual perception has arisen in me: \\
see the excellence of the teaching! 

In\marginnote{27.1} the twenty-five years \\
since I became a trainee, \\
no malicious perception has arisen in me: \\
see the excellence of the teaching!” 

“For\marginnote{28.1} 25 years \\
I attended on the Buddha \\
with loving deeds, \\
like a shadow that never left. 

For\marginnote{29.1} 25 years \\
I attended on the Buddha \\
with loving words, \\
like a shadow that never left. 

For\marginnote{30.1} 25 years \\
I attended on the Buddha \\
with loving thoughts, \\
like a shadow that never left. 

While\marginnote{31.1} the Buddha was walking mindfully, \\
I walked behind him. \\
As he taught the Dhamma, \\
knowledge arose in me.” 

“I’m\marginnote{32.1} a trainee, who has more to do; \\
my heart’s desire is still unfulfilled. \\
Yet the Teacher, who was so compassionate to me, \\
has become completely quenched. 

Then\marginnote{33.1} there was terror! \\
Then they had goosebumps! \\
When the Buddha, endowed with all fine qualities, \\
was fully quenched.” 

“Ānanda,\marginnote{34.1} who was learned \\>and had memorized the teaching, \\
a keeper of the great seer’s treasury, \\
a visionary for the entire world, \\
has become fully quenched. 

He\marginnote{35.1} was learned \\>and had memorized the teaching, \\
a keeper of the great seer’s treasury, \\
a visionary for the entire world, \\
in thick of night he dispelled the dark. 

He\marginnote{36.1} is the seer who remembered the teachings, \\
and mastered their sequence, holding them firm. \\
The senior monk who memorized the teaching, \\
Ānanda was a mine of gems.” 

“I’ve\marginnote{37.1} served the teacher \\
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions. \\
The heavy burden is laid down, \\
now there’ll be no more future lives.”

\begin{verse}%
“You\marginnote{1.1} shouldn’t live for the adulation of a following; \\
it turns your mind, making it hard to get immersion. \\
Seeing that popularity is suffering, \\
you shouldn’t consent to a following. 

A\marginnote{2.1} sage should not visit respectable families; \\
it turns your mind, making it hard to get immersion. \\
If you’re eager and greedy for flavors, \\
you’ll miss the goal that brings such happiness. 

They\marginnote{3.1} know it really is a bog, \\
this homage and veneration in respectable families. \\
Honor is a subtle dart, hard to extract, \\
and hard for a sinner to give up.” 

“I\marginnote{4.1} came down from my lodging \\
and entered the city for alms. \\
I courteously stood by \\
while a leper ate. 

With\marginnote{5.1} his putrid hand \\
he offered me a morsel. \\
Putting the morsel in my bowl, \\
his finger dropped off right there. 

Sitting\marginnote{6.1} by a wall, \\
I ate that lump of rice. \\
I did not feel any disgust \\
while eating or afterwards. 

Anyone\marginnote{7.1} who makes use of \\
leftovers for food, \\
rancid urine as medicine, \\
the root of a tree as lodging, \\
and cast-off rags as robes, \\
is at ease in any quarter.” 

“Where\marginnote{8.1} some have fallen to ruin \\
while climbing the mountain, \\
there Kassapa ascends; \\
an heir of the Buddha, \\
aware and mindful, \\
owing to his psychic powers. 

Returning\marginnote{9.1} from almsround, \\
Kassapa ascends the mountain, \\
and practices absorption without grasping, \\
with fear and dread given up. 

Returning\marginnote{10.1} from almsround, \\
Kassapa ascends the mountain, \\
and practices absorption without grasping, \\
quenched amongst those who burn. 

Returning\marginnote{11.1} from almsround, \\
Kassapa ascends the mountain, \\
and practices absorption without grasping, \\
his task completed, free of defilements.” 

“Strewn\marginnote{12.1} with garlands of the musk-rose tree, \\
these regions are so delightful, so lovely, \\
echoing with the trumpeting of elephants: \\
these rocky crags delight me! 

Glistening,\marginnote{13.1} they look like blue storm clouds, \\
with waters cool and streams so clear, \\
and covered all in ladybugs: \\
these rocky crags delight me! 

Like\marginnote{14.1} the peak of a blue storm cloud, \\
or like a fine bungalow, lovely, \\
echoing with the trumpeting of elephants: \\
these rocky crags delight me! 

The\marginnote{15.1} rain comes down on the lovely flats, \\
in the mountains frequented by seers. \\
Echoing with the cries of peacocks, \\
these rocky crags delight me! 

It’s\marginnote{16.1} enough for me, who loves absorption, \\
to remain resolute. \\
It’s enough for me, \\
a resolute monk who loves the goal. 

It’s\marginnote{17.1} enough for me, \\
a resolute monk who loves comfort. \\
It’s enough for me, \\
resolute and unaffected, loving meditation. 

Covered\marginnote{18.1} with flowers of flax, \\
like the welkin covered with clouds, \\
full of flocks of many different birds, \\
these rocky crags delight me! 

Empty\marginnote{19.1} of householders, \\
frequented by herds of deer, \\
full of flocks of many different birds, \\
these rocky crags delight me! 

The\marginnote{20.1} water’s clear and the rocks are broad, \\
monkeys and deer are all around; \\
festooned with dewy moss, \\
these rocky crags delight me!” 

“Even\marginnote{21.1} the music of a five-piece band \\
can never give such pleasure \\
as when, with unified mind, \\
you rightly discern the Dhamma.” 

“Don’t\marginnote{22.1} get involved in lots of work, \\
avoid people, and don’t try to acquire things. \\
If you’re eager and greedy for flavors, \\
you’ll miss the goal that brings such happiness. 

Don’t\marginnote{23.1} get involved in lots of work, \\
avoid what doesn’t lead to the goal. \\
The body gets worn out and fatigued, \\
and when you ache, you won’t find serenity.” 

“You\marginnote{24.1} won’t see yourself \\
by merely reciting words, \\
wandering stiff-necked \\
and thinking, ‘I’m better than them.’ 

The\marginnote{25.1} fool is no better, \\
but they think they are. \\
The wise don’t praise \\
pompous people. 

Whoever\marginnote{26.1} is not affected \\
by the modes of conceit—\\
‘I am better’, ‘I’m not better’, \\
‘I am worse’, or ‘I am the same’—

with\marginnote{27.1} such understanding, unaffected, \\
steady in ethics, \\
and devoted to serenity of mind: \\
that is who the wise praise.” 

“Whoever\marginnote{28.1} has no respect \\
for their spiritual companions \\
is as far from the true teaching \\
as the earth is from the sky. 

Those\marginnote{29.1} whose conscience and prudence \\
are always rightly established, \\
thrive in the spiritual life; \\
for them, there are no future lives. 

When\marginnote{30.1} a mendicant who is haughty and fickle \\
wears rags from the rubbish-heap, \\
that doesn’t make them shine: \\
they’re like a monkey in a lion skin. 

But\marginnote{31.1} if they not restless or fickle, \\
alert, with senses restrained, \\
then, wearing rags from the rubbish-heap, they shine \\
like a lion in a mountain cave.” 

“These\marginnote{32.1} many gods \\
powerful and glorious, \\
all 10,000 of them, \\
belong to the host of the Divinity. 

They\marginnote{33.1} stand with joined palms \\
honoring \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, \\
the general of the Dhamma, the hero, \\
the serene great meditator: 

‘Homage\marginnote{34.1} to you, O thoroughbred! \\
Homage to you, supreme among men! \\
We don’t understand \\
the basis of your absorption. 

The\marginnote{35.1} profound domain of the Buddhas \\
is truly amazing. \\
We don’t understand, \\
though we’ve gathered here to split hairs.’ 

When\marginnote{36.1} he saw the host of gods \\
paying homage to \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}—\\
who is truly worthy of homage—\\
Kappina smiled.” 

“As\marginnote{37.1} far as the range of the Buddha extends, \\
I am outstanding in austerities. \\
I have no equal, \\
apart from the great sage himself. 

I’ve\marginnote{38.1} served the teacher \\
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions. \\
The heavy burden is laid down, \\
now there’ll be no more future lives.” 

“Like\marginnote{39.1} a lotus flower \\
to which water will not stick, \\
Gotama the immeasurable is unstained \\
by robes, lodgings, or food. \\
He inclines to renunciation, \\
and has escaped the three states of existence. 

The\marginnote{40.1} great sage’s neck is mindfulness meditation; \\
faith is his hands, and wisdom his head. \\
Having great knowledge, \\
he always wanders, quenched.”

walking the path trodden by the sages? \\
When will it be? 

Oh,\marginnote{13.1} when will I rise up, \\>intent on attaining freedom from death, \\
hearing, in the mountain cave, \\
the cry of the crested peacock in the forest? \\
When will it be? 

Oh,\marginnote{14.1} when will I cross the Ganges, \textsanskrit{Yamunā}, \\
and \textsanskrit{Sarasvatī} rivers, the \textsanskrit{Pātāla} country, \\
and the dangerous \textsanskrit{Baḷavāmukha} sea, \\
by psychic power unobstructed? When will it be? 

Oh,\marginnote{15.1} when will I be devoted to absorption, \\
rejecting entirely the signs of beauty, \\
splitting apart desire for sensual stimulation, \\
like an elephant that wanders free of ties? \\>When will it be? 

Oh,\marginnote{16.1} when will I realize the teaching of the great seer \\
and be content, like a pauper in debt \\
harassed by creditors, who finds a hidden treasure? \\
When will it be? 

For\marginnote{17.1} many years you begged me, \\
“Enough of living in a house for you!” \\
Why do you not urge me on, mind, \\
now that I’ve gone forth as an ascetic? 

Didn’t\marginnote{18.1} you entice me, mind: \\
“On the Mountainfold, the birds with colorful wings, \\
greeting the thunder, Mahinda’s voice,\footnote{Mahinda is “Great Indra”, the god of thunder. } \\
will delight you as you meditate in the forest?” 

In\marginnote{19.1} my family circle, friends, loved ones, and relatives; \\
and in the world, sports and play, \\>and sensual pleasures; \\
all these I gave up when I entered this life: \\
and even then you’re not content with me, mind! 

This\marginnote{20.1} is mine alone, it doesn’t belong to others; \\
when it is time to don your armor, why lament? \\
Observing that all this is unstable, \\
I went forth, seeking the state free of death. 

The\marginnote{21.1} methodical teacher, supreme among people, \\
great physician, \\>guide for those who wish to train, said: \\
“The mind fidgets like a monkey, \\
so it’s very hard to control if you are not free of lust.” 

Sensual\marginnote{22.1} pleasures are diverse, sweet, delightful; \\
an ignorant ordinary person is bound to them. \\
Seeking to be reborn again, they wish for suffering; \\
led on by their mind, they’re relegated to hell. 

“Staying\marginnote{23.1} in the grove resounding with cries \\
of peacocks and herons, \\>and adorned by leopards and tigers, \\
abandon concern for the body, without fail!” \\
So you used to urge me, mind. 

“Develop\marginnote{24.1} the absorptions and spiritual faculties, \\
the powers, awakening factors, and immersion; \\
realize the three knowledges \\>in the teaching of the Buddha!” \\
So you used to urge me, mind. 

“Develop\marginnote{25.1} the eightfold path to realize freedom from death \\
emancipating, plunging into the end of all suffering, \\
and cleansing all defilements!” \\
So you used to urge me, mind. 

“Reflect\marginnote{26.1} rationally on the aggregates as suffering, \\
and abandon that from which suffering arises; \\
make an end of suffering in this very life!” \\
So you used to urge me, mind. 

“Rationally\marginnote{27.1} discern that impermanence is suffering, \\
that emptiness is non-self, and that misery is death. \\
Uproot the wandering mind!” \\
So you used to urge me, mind. 

“Bald,\marginnote{28.1} unsightly, accursed, \\
seek alms amongst families, bowl in hand. \\
Devote yourself to the word of the teacher, the great seer!” \\
So you used to urge me, mind. 

“Wander\marginnote{29.1} the streets well-restrained, \\
mentally unsnared to families and sensual pleasures, \\
like the full moon on a bright night!” \\
So you used to urge me, mind. 

“Be\marginnote{30.1} a wilderness-dweller and an alms-eater, \\
one who lives in charnel grounds, a rag-robe wearer, \\
one who never lies down, \\>always delighting in ascetic practices.” \\
So you used to urge me, mind. 

Mind,\marginnote{31.1} when you urge me to the impermanent and unstable, \\
you’re acting like someone who plants trees, \\
then, when they’re about to fruit, \\
wishes to cut down the very same trees. 

Incorporeal\marginnote{32.1} mind, far-traveler, lone-wanderer: \\
I won’t do your bidding any more. \\
Sensual pleasures are suffering, painful, \\>and very dangerous; \\
I’ll wander with my mind focused only on extinguishment. 

I\marginnote{33.1} didn’t go forth due to bad luck or shamelessness, \\
or due to a whim or banishment, \\
nor for the sake of a livelihood; \\
it was because I agreed \\>to the promise you made, mind. 

“Having\marginnote{34.1} few wishes, abandoning disparagement, \\
the stilling of suffering: \\>these are praised by true persons.” \\
So you used to urge me, mind, \\
but now you keep on with your old habits! 

Craving,\marginnote{35.1} ignorance, the loved and unloved, \\
pretty sights, pleasant feelings, \\
and the delightful kinds of sensual stimulation: \\
I’ve vomited them up, I can’t swallow them back. 

I’ve\marginnote{36.1} done your bidding everywhere, mind! \\
For many births, I’ve done nothing to upset you. \\
Yet the creation in myself is because of your ingratitude—\footnote{Read \textit{\textsanskrit{akataññutāya}}. The “creation in myself” (\textit{ajjhattasambhavo}) is craving. } \\
for a long time I’ve transmigrated \\>in the suffering you’ve made. 

Only\marginnote{37.1} you, mind, make a brahmin; \\
you make an aristocrat or a royal seer. \\
Sometimes we become peasants or menials; \\
and life as a god is also on account of you. 

You\marginnote{38.1} alone make us titans; \\
because of you we’re born in hell. \\
Then sometimes we become animals, \\
and life as a ghost is also on account of you. 

Come\marginnote{39.1} what may, you won’t betray me again, \\
dazzling me with your ever-changing display! \\
You play with me like I’m mad—\\
but how have I ever failed you, mind? 

In\marginnote{40.1} the past my mind wandered \\
how it wished, where it liked, as it pleased. \\
Now I’ll carefully guide it, \\
as a trainer with a hook guides a rutting elephant. 

The\marginnote{41.1} teacher willed that this world appear to me \\
as impermanent, unstable, insubstantial. \\
Mind, let me leap into the victor’s teaching, \\
carry me over the great flood, so hard to pass. 

Things\marginnote{42.1} have changed, mind! \\
Nothing could make me return to your control! \\
I’ve gone forth in the teaching of the great seer, \\
those like me don’t come to ruin. 

Mountains,\marginnote{43.1} oceans, rivers, the earth; \\
the four quarters, the intermediate directions, \\>below and in the sky; \\
the three realms of existence \\>are all impermanent and troubled—\\
where can you go to find happiness, mind? 

Mind,\marginnote{44.1} what will you do to someone \\>who has made the ultimate commitment? \\
Nothing could make me a follower \\>under your control, mind; \\
I’d never touch a bellows \\>with a mouth open at each end; \\
curse this mortal frame flowing with nine streams! 

You’ve\marginnote{45.1} ascended the mountain peak, \\>full of nature’s beauty, \\
frequented by boars and antelopes, \\
a grove sprinkled with fresh water in the monsoon; \\
and there you’ll be happy in your cave-home. 

Peacocks\marginnote{46.1} with beautiful necks and crests, \\
colorful tail-feathers and wings, \\
crying out at the resounding thunder: \\
they’ll delight you as you meditate in the forest. 

When\marginnote{47.1} the heavens have rained, and the grass is four inches high, \\
and the grove is full of flowers like a cloud, \\
between the mountains, like the fork of a tree, I’ll lie; \\
it will be as soft as cotton-buds. 

I’ll\marginnote{48.1} act as a master does: \\
let whatever I get be enough for me. \\
And that’s why I’ll make you as supple \\
as a tireless worker makes a cat-skin bag. 

I’ll\marginnote{49.1} act as a master does: \\
let whatever I get be enough for me. \\
I’ll control you with my energy, \\
as a skilled trainer controls an elephant with a hook. 

Now\marginnote{50.1} that you’re well-tamed and reliable, \\
I can use you, \\>like a trainer uses a straight-running horse, \\
to practice the path so full of grace, \\
cultivated by those who take care of their minds. 

I\marginnote{51.1} shall strongly fasten you to a meditation subject, \\
as an elephant is tied to a post with firm rope. \\
You’ll be well-guarded by me, \\>well-developed by mindfulness, \\
and unattached to rebirth in all states of existence. 

With\marginnote{52.1} wisdom you’ll cut short the one following the wrong path, \\
curb them by practice, and settle them on the right path. \\
Having seen arising and passing away \\>with respect to the cause of suffering,\footnote{Take \textit{\textsanskrit{samudayaṁ}} as accusative of relation, equivalent to locative (although treated as genitive in commentary). } \\
you’ll be an heir to the greatest teacher. 

Under\marginnote{53.1} the sway of the four distortions, mind, \\
you dragged me around like a bull in a pit; \\
but now you won’t associate \\>with the great sage of compassion, \\
the cutter of fetters and bonds? 

Like\marginnote{54.1} a deer roaming free in the colorful forest, \\
I’ll ascend the lovely mountain wreathed in monsoon clouds, \\
and rejoice to be on that hill, free of folk—\\
there is no doubt you’ll perish, mind. 

The\marginnote{55.1} men and women who live \\>under your will and command, \\
whatever pleasure they experience, \\
they are ignorant and fall under \textsanskrit{Māra}’s control; \\
loving life, they’re your disciples, mind.

\begin{verse}%
“Living\marginnote{1.1} in the wilderness, eating only almsfood, \\
happy with the scraps in our bowls, \\
let us tear apart the army of death, \\
while remaining serene within. 

Living\marginnote{2.1} in the wilderness, eating only almsfood, \\
happy with the scraps in our bowls, \\
let us crush the army of death, \\
as an elephant a hut of reeds. 

Living\marginnote{3.1} at the foot of a tree, persistent, \\
happy with the scraps in our bowls, \\
let us tear apart the army of death, \\
while remaining serene within. 

Living\marginnote{4.1} at the foot of a tree, persistent, \\
happy with the scraps in our bowls, \\
let us crush the army of death, \\
as an elephant a hut of reeds.” 

“You\marginnote{5.1} little hut, made of a chain of bones, \\
sewn together with flesh and sinew; \\
curse you mortal frame, you stink, \\
you cherish the parts of others! 

You\marginnote{6.1} sack of dung encased in skin! \\
You demoness with horns on your chest! \\
O body, you have nine streams \\
that are flowing all the time. 

With\marginnote{7.1} its nine streams, \\
your body stinks, full of dung. \\
A monk seeking purity \\
would avoid it like excrement. 

If\marginnote{8.1} they knew you \\
like I do, \\
they’d keep far away, \\
like a cesspit in the monsoon.” 

“So\marginnote{9.1} it is, great hero! \\
As you say, ascetic! \\
But some flounder here \\
like an old bull stuck in a bog.” 

“Whoever\marginnote{10.1} might think \\
of making the sky yellow, \\
or some other color, \\
would only trouble themselves. 

This\marginnote{11.1} mind is like the sky: \\
serene inside itself. \\
Evil-minded one, don’t attack me, \\
you’ll end up like a moth in a mass of fire.” 

“See\marginnote{12.1} this fancy puppet, \\
a body built of sores, \\
diseased, obsessed over, \\
in which nothing lasts at all. 

See\marginnote{13.1} this fancy figure, \\
with its gems and earrings; \\
it is bones encased in skin, \\
made pretty by its clothes. 

Rouged\marginnote{14.1} feet \\
and powdered face \\
may be enough to beguile a fool, \\
but not a seeker of the far shore. 

Hair\marginnote{15.1} in eight braids \\
and eyeshadow \\
may be enough to beguile a fool, \\
but not a seeker of the far shore. 

A\marginnote{16.1} rotting body all adorned \\
like a freshly painted makeup box \\
may be enough to beguile a fool, \\
but not a seeker of the far shore. 

The\marginnote{17.1} hunter laid his snare, \\
but the deer didn’t spring the trap. \\
I’ve eaten the bait and now I go, \\
leaving the trapper to lament. 

The\marginnote{18.1} hunter’s trap is broken, \\
but the deer didn’t spring the trap. \\
I’ve eaten the bait and now I go, \\
leaving the deer-hunter to grieve.” 

“Then\marginnote{19.1} there was terror! \\
Then they had goosebumps! \\
When \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, \\>endowed with many fine qualities,\footnote{When this verse is spoken at the Buddha’s death, it says “all fine qualities”. } \\
became quenched. 

Oh!\marginnote{20.1} Conditions are impermanent, \\
their nature is to rise and fall; \\
having arisen, they cease; \\
their stilling is blissful.” 

“Those\marginnote{21.1} who see the five aggregates \\
as other, not as self, \\
penetrate a subtle thing, \\
like a hair-tip with an arrow. 

Those\marginnote{22.1} who see conditions \\
as other, not as self, \\
pierce a fine thing, \\
like a hair-tip with an arrow.” 

“Like\marginnote{23.1} they’re struck by a sword, \\
like their head was on fire, \\
a mendicant should wander mindful, \\
to give up sensual desire. 

Like\marginnote{24.1} they’re struck by a sword, \\
like their head was on fire, \\
a mendicant should wander mindful, \\
to give up desire for rebirth.” 

“Urged\marginnote{25.1} by the developed one, \\
who bore his final body, \\
I shook the stilt longhouse of \textsanskrit{Migāra}’s mother \\
with my big toe.” 

“Not\marginnote{26.1} by being slack, \\
or with little strength \\
is extinguishment realized, \\
the release from all ties.” 

“This\marginnote{27.1} young monk, \\
this best of men, \\
bears his final body, \\
having vanquished \textsanskrit{Māra} and his mount.” 

“Lightning\marginnote{28.1} flashes down \\
on the cleft of \textsanskrit{Vebhāra} and \textsanskrit{Paṇḍava}. \\
But in the mountain cleft he is absorbed in \textsanskrit{jhāna}—\\
the son of the Buddha, inimitable and unaffected.” 

“Calm\marginnote{29.1} and still, \\
the sage in his remote lodging, \\
the heir to the best of Buddhas, \\
is honored even by the Divinity. 

Calm\marginnote{30.1} and still, \\
the sage in his remote lodging, \\
is heir to the best of Buddhas: \\
Brahmin, you should honor Kassapa! 

Even\marginnote{31.1} if someone were to be born again and again \\
a hundred times in the human realm, \\
and always as a brahmin, \\
a student accomplished in the Vedas; 

and\marginnote{32.1} if he were to become a reciter, \\
a master of the three Vedas: \\
honoring such a person \\
isn’t worth a sixteenth of that. 

One\marginnote{33.1} who attains the eight liberations \\
forwards and backwards \\
before breakfast, \\
and then goes on almsround—

don’t\marginnote{34.1} attack such a mendicant! \\
Don’t ruin yourself, brahmin! \\
Let your heart have trust \\
in the perfected one, the unaffected; \\
quickly venerate him with joined palms: \\
don’t let your head explode!” 

“If\marginnote{35.1} you prioritize transmigration, \\
you don’t see the true teaching. \\
You’re following a twisted path, \\
a bad path that will lead you down. 

Like\marginnote{36.1} a worm smeared with dung, \\
he is besotted with conditions. \\
Consumed by gain and honor, \\
\textsanskrit{Poṭṭhila} goes on, hollow.” 

“See\marginnote{37.1} \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} coming! \\
It is good to see him; \\
he is freed in both ways, \\
serene inside himself; 

free\marginnote{38.1} of thorns, with yoking ended, \\
master of the three knowledges, \\>conqueror of death; \\
worthy of offerings, \\
a supreme field of merit for the people.” 

“These\marginnote{39.1} many gods, \\
powerful and glorious, \\
all 10,000 of them, \\
are priests of Divinity. \\
They stand with joined palms \\
honoring \textsanskrit{Moggallāna}: 

‘Homage\marginnote{40.1} to you, O thoroughbred! \\
Homage to you, supreme among men! \\
Since your defilements are ended, \\
you, sir, are worthy of teacher’s offerings.’ 

Venerated\marginnote{41.1} by men and gods, \\
he has arisen, the master of death. \\
He is unsmeared by conditions, \\
as a lotus-flower by water.” 

“The\marginnote{42.1} mendicant by whom the galaxy \\
with the age of the Divinity are known in an hour—\\
that master of psychic ability sees the gods \\
at the time they pass away and are reborn.” 

“\textsanskrit{Sāriputta}\marginnote{43.1} is full of wisdom, \\
ethics, and peace. \\
Even a mendicant who has crossed over \\
might at best equal him. 

But\marginnote{44.1} in a moment I can create the likenesses \\
of ten million times 100,000 people! \\
I’m skilled in transformations; \\
I’m a master of psyshic powers. 

A\marginnote{45.1} member of the \textsanskrit{Moggallāna} clan, \\>attained to perfection and mastery \\
in immersion and knowledge, \\>wise in the teachings of the unattached, \\
with serene faculties, has burst his bonds \\
like an elephant bursts a vine. 

I’ve\marginnote{46.1} served the teacher \\
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions. \\
The heavy burden is laid down, \\
the conduit to rebirth is eradicated. 

I’ve\marginnote{47.1} attained the goal \\
for the sake of which I went forth \\
from the lay life to homelessness—\\
the end of all fetters.” 

“What\marginnote{48.1} kind of hell was that, \\
where \textsanskrit{Dūsī} was roasted \\
after attacking the disciple Vidhura \\
along with the brahmin Kakusandha? 

There\marginnote{49.1} were 100 iron spikes, \\
each one individually painful. \\
That’s the kind of hell \\
where \textsanskrit{Dūsī} was roasted \\
after attacking the disciple Vidhura \\
along with the brahmin Kakusandha. 

Dark\marginnote{50.1} One, if you attack \\
a mendicant who directly knows this, \\
a disciple of the Buddha, \\
you’ll fall into suffering. 

There\marginnote{51.1} are mansions that last an eon \\
standing in the middle of a lake. \\
Sapphire-colored, brilliant, \\
they sparkle and shine. \\
Dancing there are nymphs \\
shining in all different colors. 

Dark\marginnote{52.1} One, if you attack \\
a mendicant who directly knows this, \\
a disciple of the Buddha, \\
you’ll fall into suffering. 

I’m\marginnote{53.1} the one who, urged by the Buddha, \\
shook the stilt longhouse of \textsanskrit{Migāra}’s mother \\
with his big toe \\
as the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of mendicants watched. 

Dark\marginnote{54.1} One, if you attack \\
a mendicant who directly knows this, \\
a disciple of the Buddha, \\
you’ll fall into suffering. 

I’m\marginnote{55.1} the one who shook the Palace of Victory \\
with his big toe \\
owing to psychic power, \\
inspiring deities to awe. 

Dark\marginnote{56.1} One, if you attack \\
a mendicant who directly knows this, \\
a disciple of the Buddha, \\
you’ll fall into suffering. 

I’m\marginnote{57.1} the one who asked Sakka \\
in the Palace of Victory: \\
‘Sir, I hope you recall \\
the one who is freed through the ending of craving?’\footnote{\textsanskrit{Moggallāna} asked Sakka if he remembered the teaching on this topic that he had received from the Buddha (\href{https://suttacentral.net/mn37/en/sujato\#8.1}{MN 37:8.1}). | The compound \textit{\textsanskrit{taṇhākkhayavimuttiyo}} is translated as a feminine plural by Norman in \emph{Elders’ Verses}, but \href{https://suttacentral.net/mn37/en/sujato\#2.2}{MN 37:2.2} refers to “the mendicant who is freed” in singular. Resolve to \textit{\textsanskrit{taṇhākkhayavimutti} yo}; \textit{vimutti} agrees with \textit{yo} as the nominative singular of the masculine agent noun in \textit{-in}, which occurs in the same phrase at \href{https://suttacentral.net/an4.38/en/sujato\#6.2}{AN 4.38:6.2} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti55/en/sujato\#4.2}{Iti 55:4.2}. } \\
And I’m the one to whom Sakka \\
admitted the truth when asked. 

Dark\marginnote{58.1} One, if you attack \\
a mendicant who directly knows this, \\
a disciple of the Buddha, \\
you’ll fall into suffering. 

I’m\marginnote{59.1} the one who asked the Divinity \\
in the Hall of Justice before the assembly: \\
‘Reverend, do you still have the same view \\
that you had in the past? \\
Or do you see the radiance \\
transcending the realm of divinity?’ 

And\marginnote{60.1} I’m the one to whom the Divinity \\
admitted the truth when asked. \\
‘Good sir, I don’t have that view \\
that I had in the past. 

I\marginnote{61.1} see the radiance \\
transcending the realm of divinity. \\
So how could I say today \\
that I am permanent and eternal?’ 

Dark\marginnote{62.1} One, if you attack \\
a mendicant who directly knows this, \\
a disciple of the Buddha, \\
you’ll fall into suffering. 

I’m\marginnote{63.1} the one who touched the peak of Mount Neru \\
using the power of meditative liberation. \\
I’ve visited the forests of the people \\
who dwell in the Eastern Continent. 

Dark\marginnote{64.1} One, if you attack \\
a mendicant who directly knows this, \\
a disciple of the Buddha, \\
you’ll fall into suffering. 

Though\marginnote{65.1} a fire doesn’t think: \\
‘I’ll burn the fool!’ \\
Still the fool who attacks \\
the fire gets burnt. 

In\marginnote{66.1} the same way, \textsanskrit{Māra}, \\
in attacking the Realized One, \\
you’ll only burn yourself, \\
like a fool touching the flames. 

\textsanskrit{Māra}’s\marginnote{67.1} done a bad thing \\
in attacking the Realized One. \\
Wicked One, do you imagine that \\
your wickedness won’t bear fruit? 

Your\marginnote{68.1} deeds heap up wickedness \\
that will last a long time, Terminator! \\
Give up on the Buddha, \textsanskrit{Māra}! \\
And hold no hope for the mendicants!” 

That\marginnote{69.1} is how, in the \textsanskrit{Bhesekaḷā} grove,\footnote{The commentary says that this verse was added at the Council. } \\
the mendicant condemned \textsanskrit{Māra}. \\
That spirit, downcast, \\
disappeared right there.

\begin{verse}%
“Now\marginnote{1.1} that I’ve gone forth \\
from the lay life to homelessness, \\
I’m overrun \\
by the rude thoughts of the Dark One. 

Even\marginnote{2.1} if a thousand mighty princes and great archers, \\
well trained, with strong bows, \\
were to completely surround me; \\
I would never flee. 

And\marginnote{3.1} even if women come, \\
many more than that, \\
they won’t scare me, \\
for I stand firm in the teaching. 

I\marginnote{4.1} heard this with my own ears \\
from the Buddha, kinsman of the Sun, \\
about the path going to extinguishment; \\
that’s what delights my mind. 

Wicked\marginnote{5.1} One, if you come near me \\
as I meditate like this, \\
I’ll make sure that you, Death, \\
won’t even see the path I take.” 

“Giving\marginnote{6.1} up discontent and desire, \\
along with all thoughts of domestic life, \\
they wouldn’t get entangled in anything; \\
unentangled, disentangled: that’s a real mendicant. 

Whether\marginnote{7.1} on this earth or in the sky, \\
whatever in the world is included in form \\
wears out, it is all impermanent; \\
the thoughtful live having comprehended this truth. 

People\marginnote{8.1} are bound to their attachments, \\
to what is seen, heard, felt, and thought. \\
Unstirred, dispel desire for these things; \\
for one called ‘a sage’ does not cling to them. 

Attached\marginnote{9.1} to the sixty wrong views, \\>and full of their own opinions, \\
ordinary people are fixed in wrong principles. \\
But that mendicant wouldn’t join a sectarian group, \\
still less would they utter lewd speech. 

Clever,\marginnote{10.1} long serene, \\
free of deceit, alert, without envy, \\
the sage has reached the state of peace; \\
quenched, he awaits his time.” 

“Give\marginnote{11.1} up conceit, Gotama! \\
Completely abandon the different kinds of conceit! \\
Besotted with the different kinds of conceit, \\
you’ve had regrets for a long time. 

Smeared\marginnote{12.1} by smears and slain by conceit, \\
people fall into hell. \\
When people slain by conceit are reborn in hell, \\
they grieve for a long time. 

But\marginnote{13.1} a mendicant who practices rightly, \\
winner of the path, never grieves. \\
They enjoy happiness and a good reputation, \\
and they rightly call him a ‘Seer of Truth’. 

So\marginnote{14.1} don’t be hard-hearted, be energetic, \\
with hindrances given up, be pure. \\
Then with conceit given up completely, \\
use knowledge to make an end, and be calmed.” 

“I’ve\marginnote{15.1} got a burning desire for pleasure; \\
my mind is on fire! \\
Please, out of compassion, Gotama, \\
tell me how to quench the flames.” 

“Your\marginnote{16.1} mind is on fire \\
because of a perversion of perception. \\
Turn away from the sign \\
that’s attractive, provoking lust. 

With\marginnote{17.1} your mind unified and serene, \\
meditate on the ugly aspects of the body. \\
With mindfulness immersed in the body, \\
be full of disillusionment. 

Meditate\marginnote{18.1} on the signless, \\
give up the tendency to conceit; \\
and when you comprehend conceit, \\
you will live at peace.” 

“Speak\marginnote{19.1} only such words \\
that do not hurt yourself \\
nor harm others; \\
such speech is truly well spoken. 

Speak\marginnote{20.1} only pleasing words, \\
words gladly welcomed. \\
Pleasing words are those \\
that bring nothing bad to others. 

Truth\marginnote{21.1} itself is the undying word: \\
this is an ancient teaching. \\
Good people say that the teaching and its meaning \\
are grounded in the truth. 

The\marginnote{22.1} words spoken by the Buddha \\
for finding the sanctuary, extinguishment, \\
for making an end of suffering: \\
this really is the best kind of speech.” 

“Deep\marginnote{23.1} in wisdom, intelligent, \\
expert in what is the path \\>and what is not the path; \\
\textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, so greatly wise, \\
teaches Dhamma to the mendicants. 

He\marginnote{24.1} teaches in brief, \\
or he speaks at length. \\
His call, like a myna bird, \\
overflows with inspiration. 

While\marginnote{25.1} he teaches \\
the mendicants listen to his sweet voice, \\
sounding attractive, \\
clear and graceful. \\
They listen joyfully, \\
their hearts elated.” 

“Today,\marginnote{26.1} on the fifteenth day sabbath, \\
five hundred monks have gathered together \\>to purify their precepts. \\
These untroubled sages \\>have cut off their fetters and bonds, \\
they will not be reborn again. 

Just\marginnote{27.1} as a wheel-rolling monarch \\
surrounded by ministers \\
travels all around this \\
land that’s girt by sea. 

So\marginnote{28.1} disciples with the three knowledges, \\
conquerors of death, \\
revere the winner of the battle, \\
the unsurpassed caravan leader. 

All\marginnote{29.1} are sons of the Blessed One—\\
there is no rubbish here. \\
I bow to the kinsman of the Sun, \\
destroyer of the dart of craving.” 

“Over\marginnote{30.1} a thousand mendicants \\
revere the Holy One \\
as he teaches the immaculate Dhamma, \\
extinguishment, fearing nothing from any quarter. 

They\marginnote{31.1} listen to the immaculate Dhamma \\
taught by the fully awakened Buddha; \\
the Buddha is so brilliant, \\
at the fore of the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}. 

Blessed\marginnote{32.1} One, your name is ‘Giant’, \\
seventh of the sages. \\
You are like a great cloud \\
that rains on your disciples. 

I’ve\marginnote{33.1} left my day’s meditation, \\
out of desire to see the teacher. \\
Great hero, your disciple \textsanskrit{Vaṅgīsa} \\
bows at your feet.” 

“Having\marginnote{34.1} overcome \textsanskrit{Māra}’s devious path, \\
you wander with hard-heartedness dissolved.\footnote{\href{https://suttacentral.net/sn8.8/en/sujato\#8.2}{SN 8.8:8.2} has the second person \textit{carasi}, and it seems reasonable to assume that \textsanskrit{Vaṅgīsa} is continuing to address the Buddha directly. | From the same place accept the reading \textit{khila} rather than \textit{\textsanskrit{khīla}}. } \\
See him, the liberator from bonds, unattached,\footnote{Here \textsanskrit{Vaṅgīsa} turns to address the monks directly. } \\
analyzing the teaching. 

You\marginnote{35.1} have explained in many ways \\
the path to cross the flood. \\
The Seers of Truth stand unfaltering\footnote{These lines follow Bodhi’s reading at \href{https://suttacentral.net/sn8.8/en/sujato\#9.3}{SN 8.8:9.3}. } \\
in the freedom from death you’ve explained. 

As\marginnote{36.1} the bringer of light who has pierced the truth, \\
you’ve seen what lies beyond all realms.\footnote{\textit{Ṭhiti} is \textit{\textsanskrit{viññāṇaṭṭhiti}} (“stations of consciousness”), i.e. realms in which consciousness can be reborn. } \\
When you saw and realized this for yourself, \\
you taught it first to the group of five. 

When\marginnote{37.1} the Dhamma has been so well taught, \\
how could those who know it be negligent? \\
That’s why, being diligent, we should always train \\
respectfully in the Buddha’s teaching.” 

“The\marginnote{38.1} senior monk who was awakened \\>right after the Buddha,\footnote{Spoken at \href{https://suttacentral.net/sn8.9/en/sujato\#3.1}{SN 8.9:3.1}, while the first two lines are included in \textsanskrit{Koṇḍañña}’s verses at \href{https://suttacentral.net/thag21.1/en/sujato\#38.1}{Thag 21.1:38.1}. } \\
\textsanskrit{Koṇḍañña}, is keenly energetic. \\
He regularly gains blissful meditative states, \\
and the three kinds of seclusion. 

Whatever\marginnote{39.1} can be attained by a disciple \\
who does the Teacher’s bidding, \\
he has attained it all, \\
through diligently training himself. 

With\marginnote{40.1} great power and the three knowledges, \\
expert in comprehending the minds of others, \\
\textsanskrit{Koṇḍañña}, the heir to the Buddha, \\
bows at the Teacher’s feet.” 

“As\marginnote{41.1} the sage, who has gone beyond suffering, \\
sits upon the mountain slope, \\
he is revered by disciples with the three knowledges, \\
conquerors of death. 

\textsanskrit{Moggallāna},\marginnote{42.1} of great psychic power, \\
comprehends with his mind, \\
scrutinizing their minds, \\
liberated, free of attachments. 

So\marginnote{43.1} they revere Gotama, \\
the sage gone beyond suffering, \\
who is endowed with all path factors, \\
and with a multitude of attributes.” 

“Like\marginnote{44.1} the moon on a cloudless night, \\
like the shining immaculate sun, \\
so too \textsanskrit{Aṅgīrasa}, O great sage, \\
your glory outshines the entire world.” 

“We\marginnote{45.1} used to wander, drunk on poetry, \\
from village to village, town to town. \\
Then we saw the Buddha, \\
who has gone beyond all things. 

He,\marginnote{46.1} the sage gone beyond suffering, \\
taught me the Dhamma. \\
When we heard the Dhamma, \\>we became confident—\\
faith arose in us. 

Hearing\marginnote{47.1} him speak of \\
the aggregates, the sense-fields, \\
and the elements, I understood; \\
and then I went forth to homelessness. 

It\marginnote{48.1} is for the benefit of many \\
that the Realized Ones arise—\\
the men and women \\
who follow their instructions. 

It\marginnote{49.1} is truly for their benefit \\
that the sage realized awakening—\\
for the monks and for the nuns \\
who see that they’ve reached certainty. 

The\marginnote{50.1} Clear-eyed One, the Buddha, \\
the kinsman of the Sun, \\
has well taught the four noble truths \\
out of sympathy for living creatures. 

Suffering,\marginnote{51.1} suffering’s origin, \\
suffering’s transcendence, \\
and the noble eightfold path \\
that leads to the stilling of suffering. 

As\marginnote{52.1} these things were taught, \\
so I have seen them. \\
I’ve realized my own true goal, \\
and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions. 

It\marginnote{53.1} was so welcome for me \\
to be in the presence of the Buddha. \\
Of the well-explained teachings, \\
I arrived at the best. 

I’ve\marginnote{54.1} realized the perfection of direct knowledge; \\
my clairaudience is purified; \\
I am master of three knowledges, \\>attained in psychic power, \\
I’m expert at reading the minds of others.” 

“I\marginnote{55.1} ask the teacher unrivaled in wisdom, \\
who has cut off all doubts in this very life: \\
a monk has died at \textsanskrit{Aggāḷava}, who was \\
well-known, famous, and quenched. 

Nigrodhakappa\marginnote{56.1} was his name; \\
it was given to that brahmin by you, Blessed One. \\
He wandered in your honor, yearning for freedom, \\
energetic, a resolute Seer of Truth. 

O\marginnote{57.1} Sakyan, All-seer, \\
we all wish to know about that disciple. \\
Our ears are eager to hear, \\
for you are the most excellent teacher. 

Cut\marginnote{58.1} off our doubt, declare this to us; \\
your wisdom is vast, tell us of his quenching! \\
All-seer, speak among us, \\
like the thousand-eyed Sakka \\>in the midst of the gods! 

Whatever\marginnote{59.1} ties there are, or paths to delusion, \\
or things on the side of unknowing, \\>or that are bases of doubt \\
vanish on reaching a Realized One, \\
for his eye is the best of all people’s. 

If\marginnote{60.1} no man were ever to disperse corruptions, \\
like the wind dispersing the clouds, \\
darkness would veil the whole world; \\
not even brilliant men would shine. 

The\marginnote{61.1} attentive are bringers of light; \\
my hero, that is what I think of you. \\
We’ve come for your discernment and knowledge: \\
here in this assembly, declare to us about \textsanskrit{Kappāyana}. 

Swiftly\marginnote{62.1} send forth your sweet, sweet voice, \\
like a goose stretching its neck, gently honking, \\
lucid-flowing, with lovely tone: \\
alert, we all listen to you. 

You\marginnote{63.1} have entirely abandoned birth and death; \\
restrained and pure, speak the Dhamma! \\
For ordinary people \\>have no wish-granter,\footnote{\textit{\textsanskrit{Kāmakāro}}: “wish-granter”. Ordinary people cannot simply get what they want. } \\
but Realized Ones \\>have a comprehensibility-granter.\footnote{\textit{\textsanskrit{Saṅkheyyakāro}}: “comprehensibility-granter”. \textit{\textsanskrit{Saṅkheyya}} is “calculable, comprehensible”, not “after comprehension”. The Buddha has a gift for explaining things in a way that makes them comprehensible. } 

Your\marginnote{64.1} answer is definitive, and we will adopt it, \\
for you have perfect understanding. \\
We raise our joined palms one last time, \\
one of unrivaled wisdom, \\>don’t deliberately confuse us. 

Knowing\marginnote{65.1} the teaching of the noble ones \\>from top to bottom, \\
one of unrivaled energy, \\>don’t deliberately confuse us. \\
Like a man in the baking summer sun \\>would long for water, \\
I long for your voice, so let the sound rain forth. 

Surely\marginnote{66.1} \textsanskrit{Kappāyana} did not \\>lead the spiritual life in vain? \\
Did he realize quenching, \\
or did he still have a residue? \\
Let us hear what kind of liberation he had!” 

“He\marginnote{67.1} cut off craving for name and form right here,” \\
\scspeaker{said the Buddha, }\\
“the river of darkness that had long lain within him. \\
He has entirely crossed over birth and death.” \\
So declared the Blessed One, the leader of the five. 

“Now\marginnote{68.1} that I have heard your words, \\
seventh of sages, I am confident. \\
My question, it seems, was not in vain, \\
the brahmin did not deceive me. 

As\marginnote{69.1} he spoke, so he acted; \\
he was a disciple of the Buddha. \\
He cut the net of death the deceiver, \\
so extended and strong. 

Blessed\marginnote{70.1} One, \textsanskrit{Kappāyana} saw \\
the starting point of grasping. \\
He has indeed gone far beyond \\
Death’s dominion so hard to pass. 

God\marginnote{71.1} of gods, best of men, I bow to you, \\
and to your son, \\
who followed your example, a great hero; \\
a giant, true-born son of a giant.”

\section*{The Translator}

Bhikkhu Sujato was born as Anthony Aidan Best on 4/11/1966 in Perth, Western Australia. He grew up in the pleasant suburbs of Mt Lawley and Attadale alongside his sister Nicola, who was the good child. His mother, Margaret Lorraine Huntsman née Pinder, said “he’ll either be a priest or a poet”, while his father, Anthony Thomas Best, advised him to “never do anything for money”. He attended Aquinas College, a Catholic school, where he decided to become an atheist. At the University of WA he studied philosophy, aiming to learn what he wanted to do with his life. Finding that what he wanted to do was play guitar, he dropped out. His main band was named Martha’s Vineyard, which achieved modest success in the indie circuit. 

A seemingly random encounter with a roadside joey took him to Thailand, where he entered his first meditation retreat at Wat Ram Poeng, Chieng Mai in 1992. Feeling the call to the Buddha’s path, he took full ordination in Wat Pa Nanachat in 1994, where his teachers were Ajahn Pasanno and Ajahn Jayasaro. In 1997 he returned to Perth to study with Ajahn Brahm at Bodhinyana Monastery. 

He spent several years practicing in seclusion in Malaysia and Thailand before establishing Santi Forest Monastery in Bundanoon, NSW, in 2003. There he was instrumental in supporting the establishment of the Theravada bhikkhuni order in Australia and advocating for women’s rights. He continues to teach in Australia and globally, with a special concern for the moral implications of climate change and other forms of environmental destruction. He has published a series of books of original and groundbreaking research on early Buddhism. 

In 2005 he founded SuttaCentral together with Rod Bucknell and John Kelly. In 2015, seeing the need for a complete, accurate, plain English translation of the Pali texts, he undertook the task, spending nearly three years in isolation on the isle of Qi Mei off the coast of the nation of Taiwan. He completed the four main \textsanskrit{Nikāyas} in 2018, and the early books of the Khuddaka \textsanskrit{Nikāya} were complete by 2021. All this work is dedicated to the public domain and is entirely free of copyright encumbrance. 

In 2019 he returned to Sydney where he established Lokanta Vihara (The Monastery at the End of the World). 

\section*{Creation Process}

Translated from the Pali. The primary source was the \textsanskrit{Mahāsaṅgīti} edition, with reference to several English translations, especially those of K.R. Norman.

\section*{The Translation}

This translation aims to make a clear, readable, and accurate rendering of the \textsanskrit{Theragāthā}. The initial edition was by Jessica Walton and Bhikkhu Sujato was published in 2014 through SuttaCentral. A revised edition, bringing the terminology in line with the subsequently-translated four \textsanskrit{Nikāyas}, was published in 2019.

\section*{About SuttaCentral}

SuttaCentral publishes early Buddhist texts. Since 2005 we have provided root texts in Pali, Chinese, Sanskrit, Tibetan, and other languages, parallels between these texts, and translations in many modern languages. Building on the work of generations of scholars, we offer our contribution freely.

SuttaCentral is driven by volunteer contributions, and in addition we employ professional developers. We offer a sponsorship program for high quality translations from the original languages. Financial support for SuttaCentral is handled by the SuttaCentral Development Trust, a charitable trust registered in Australia.
