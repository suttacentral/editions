<h1>The SuttaCentral Editions Series</h1>
<p>Since 2005 SuttaCentral has provided access to the texts, translations, and parallels of early Buddhist texts. In 2018 we started creating and publishing our translations of these seminal spiritual classics. The “Editions” series now makes selected translations available as books in various forms, including print, PDF, and EPUB.</p>
<p>Editions are selected from our most complete, well-crafted, and reliable translations. They aim to bring these texts to a wider audience in forms that reward mindful reading. Care is taken with every detail of the production, and we aim to meet or exceed professional best standards in every way. These are the core scriptures underlying the entire Buddhist tradition, and we believe that they deserve to be preserved and made available in the highest quality without compromise.</p>
<p>SuttaCentral is a charitable organization. Our work is accomplished by volunteers and through the generosity of our donors. Everything we create is offered to all of humanity free of any copyright or licensing restrictions. </p>

<h1>Preface to <em>Linked Discourses</em></h1>
<p>I was introduced to Buddhism through the Theravāda tradition. I found my way to it through meditation and pursued my studies so I could more deeply understand my experiences in meditation. It didn’t take me long to notice the rather odd fact that, while meditation was supposed to reveal direct, experiential truths, there was a lot of disagreement about what these things were and what they meant. It seemed that even direct experience was filtered by beliefs and expectations. </p>
<p>I found that, while many modern teachers dismissed the role of theory, insisting that experience alone was the standard, this was not the case in the Suttas. The Buddha placed right view at the start of the path, insisting that the framing of our ideas is what gives meaning to our experiences.</p>
<p>Living in Thailand, I was surrounded by Thai-flavored Theravada. My English-speaking monastic community at Wat Pa Nanachat was somewhat more eclectic. There were monks and visitors from all over, and while the “official” teachings were mainstream Theravada and forest tradition, behind the scenes there was a whole range of spiritual ideas and priorities. I learned about different flavors of Buddhism, but I didn’t have a way of understanding how it all fit together, or how it related to my meditation. Many of the things I heard about seemed quite silly or far from the Buddha’s teaching, and I confess, I became quite dogmatic, convinced that Theravada was the one and only original and true way. It was the great Sri Lankan monk K. Sri Dhammananda who checked this impulse, gently reminding me of the respect we owe to all practitioners of Dhamma.</p>
<p>I read some books on Buddhist history, notably A.K. Warder’s <cite class="book">Indian Buddhism</cite>, and from them learned that there were early discourses in languages other than Pali, especially Chinese. This was at once exciting and a little disturbing. One monk said to me that when he thought of the existence of parallels, it was like a nervous, lurking anxiety: what if we’re wrong? What if the things we take to be true turn out to be no more than an institutional dogma, or an accidental artifact of history? Some modern schools of interpretation take this doubt as a starting point to dismantle the very idea that we can know what the Buddha taught, replacing knowledge with destructive nihilism.</p>
<p>Some years later, I met Rod Bucknell, from whom, during our discussions when starting SuttaCentral, I learned of a different approach. The Taiwanese monk Master Yin Shun (<span lang="lzh" translate="no">印順</span>) had developed a powerful theory of the origins and shared teachings in Buddhism. His insight was based on a comparative reading of all the texts (he read the Pali canon mainly from the Japanese translation) and was sparked by one of the great Mahayana treatises, Asanga’s Yogacārabhūmi. </p>
<p>Yin Shun posited that the Saṁyutta was the first and primary collection of texts in Buddhism. By this, he meant the original Saṁyutta, not the developed forms we have today in the Pali Saṁyuttanikāya, multiple Chinese Saṁyuktāgama, and various portions in Sanskrit and Tibetan. These are, like all extant collections, the outcome of a redaction process that left its discernable fingerprints. Nonetheless, the close relationship between all these texts suggests that changes have been minor.</p>
<p>Once you take this idea on board, the signs leap out from everywhere. For example, some accounts of the First Council speak of the Saṁyutta being recited first, and we find that the first three sermons are in the Saṁyutta. Most convincing, however, is the observation that the list of topics found in the Saṁyutta is central to the Buddha’s teaching: the aggregates, the senses, dependent origination, the elements, the path, and the four noble truths. When the Suttas list the Buddha’s essential teachings, they do so with topics from the Saṁyutta. And when later generations organized the Buddha’s teachings into coherent wholes, the same list of topics provided a handy scaffold.</p>
<p>This is far from a complete theory of early Buddhist texts; it is a complex situation, and there are many factors at play. But Yin Shun’s fundamental thesis offered a compelling framework to make sense of the vast mass of texts and their interrelations.</p>
<p>The Saṁyutta theory suggests a simple guideline for interpreting Suttas: look for the main understanding of key teachings in the simple Suttas of the Saṁyutta and see other discourses, especially those of the Majjhima and Dīgha, as being built upon these foundations. The theory doesn’t mean that all Saṁyutta discourses are earlier than others. It simply means that they were organized in this collection before other collections. It clarifies priority and perspective.</p>
<p>This was a revelation for me, and I pursued this insight in my book <cite class="book">A History of Mindfulness</cite>. And ever since, I have found it to be a reliable means of sorting out what the Buddha taught.</p>
<p>It was challenging. Over and over again, I had to confront my expectations and biases. The anxieties of my friend turned out to be not completely baseless. I found that I could no longer believe in Theravada as the one true, source of Buddhism: it was, rather, one of many schools, and like all schools, it preserved much and changed much. I could see the many different flavors of Buddhism—some quite alien to me—while recognizing that underneath them all lie the same fundamental teachings of the Saṁyutta.</p>
<p>At a deeper level, this helped me realize how my own biases and expectations had been shaping my understanding of my meditation experiences, and hence what I did in meditation, and hence the nature of those experiences. If you think meditation is a certain way, you will meditate in accord, and your experiences will confirm your ideas. And if you tell yourself, “This is my personal experience, and has nothing to do with theory”, then you’ll never find a way out of the cycle. For that, we need critical inquiry based on the best available facts. </p>
<p>The truth was right in front of my nose all along, yet for years I did not see it. I was practicing “mindfulness” in the belief that this was the way of insight (<i lang="pli" translate="no">vipassanā</i>). But along the way, I found that mindfulness led to serenity (<i lang="pli" translate="no">samatha</i>). This wasn’t what I had learned to expect from the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta as explained by modern teachers, for whom mindfulness and insight are intrinsically linked. </p>
<p>Studying the Saṁyutta closely I noticed that the teachings on insight—hundreds of Suttas—seldom mention mindfulness. And the teachings on mindfulness emphasize how it leads to serenity. It is serenity—the deep, immersive peace of mind called <i lang="pli" translate="no">samādhi</i> or <i lang="pli" translate="no">jhāna</i>—which then leads to liberating insight. </p>
<p>Suddenly my own experiences made sense. And so I changed the way I approached meditation in all sorts of subtle ways. I had thought of meditation as “noting” various “objects” with “momentary concentration” that would give rise to “dry insight”. But I realized that none of these words or ideas was found in the Suttas at all. It simply isn’t how the Buddha taught. Rather, he spoke of breathing mindfully, of the natural process of settling the mind, of how when one is informed by right view, wisdom emerges from a mind at peace.</p>
<p>This is my experience, and yours is different. It is not that the traditions, schools, and methods are wrong. They are fine for what they are, but what they are not are carbon copies of the Buddha’s teachings. Think of them as degrees of approximation. It is in the Suttas, and especially the Saṁyutta, that we find the closest thing to the Buddha’s words. I found that those words matched my experiences and informed my practice in ways that the schools and methods did not. And I am always grateful for those teachers who have made it possible for me to learn from the greatest teacher of them all.</p>

<p>The Saṁyutta Nikāya is the third of the four main divisions in the Sutta Piṭaka of the Pali Canon (<i lang="pli" translate="no">tipiṭaka</i>). It is translated here as <cite class="text-translated">Linked Discourses</cite>, and has been previously translated as the <cite class="text-translated">Connected Discourses</cite> or the <cite class="text-translated">Kindred Sayings</cite>. As the title suggests, its discourses are grouped thematically. These thematic groups of texts are called <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i>, and the Saṁyutta Nikāya is the collection of such <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i>.</p>
<p>The Saṁyutta Nikāya consists of 56 <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i> collected in five large “books” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i>), containing over a thousand discourses. The Mahāsaṅgīti text as used on SuttaCentral contains 2837 discourses; but the total number is somewhat arbitrary, as it depends on how the abbreviated texts are expanded, which differs in different editions. This variation, however, applies only to the way the texts are counted and does not affect the content, which is virtually identical in every edition.</p>
<p>It is in the Saṁyutta Nikāya that we find the core doctrines that have formed the basis for all subsequent Buddhist philosophy. It is largely structured around major doctrinal sections that correspond with the template of the four noble truths.</p>

</dl>
<p>The four noble truths themselves are treated in the final chapter, the Sacca Saṁyutta (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn56">SN 56</a>).</p>
<p>Not all the <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i> fit so easily into this scheme. There are many minor <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i>, which are sometimes connected with a major <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i>, and sometimes not. In addition, the first book, the Sagāthāvagga, is not organized by subject. Rather, the thematic linking here is the type of person involved in the discourse. These texts are also unified in literary form; they are in mixed prose and verse.</p>
<p>This collection has a full parallel in the Saṁyuktāgama (SA) of the Sarvāstivāda school in Chinese translation. In addition, there are two partial collections in Chinese (SA-2 and SA-3) as well as several miscellaneous or fragmentary texts in Chinese, Sanskrit, and Tibetan. Much of the organizational structure of SN is shared with SA, suggesting that this structure preceded the split between these two collections.</p>
<h2 id="intro-item1">How the Saṁyutta is Organized</h2>
<p>The Saṁyutta Nikāya is conveniently divided into five large <i lang="pli" translate="no">vaggas</i> or “books”. As noted in the General Guide, the Saṁyutta is an example of the “nested <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i>” structure, where the (unusual) <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> as “book” includes many of the normal kind of “small” <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i>, i.e. groups of about ten suttas.</p>
<p>Within each of the five “big” <i lang="pli" translate="no">vaggas</i> there are several <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i>, each containing a set of discourses that are linked by person or theme (sometimes both). For example, each of the discourses in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn5">SN 5</a> features a nun (<i lang="pli" translate="no">bhikkhunī</i>), while each discourse in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn24">SN 24</a> deals with the subject of “views” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">diṭṭhi</i>).</p>
<p>In SuttaCentral, the discourses of the Saṁyutta are referenced by <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i> and <i lang="pli" translate="no">sutta</i>. Thus <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn1.1">SN 1.1</a> is the first discourse of the first <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i>, while <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11">SN 56.11</a> is the eleventh discourse of the fifty-sixth <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i>. The SuttaCentral system is the same as that used by Bhikkhu Bodhi in his <cite class="book">Connected Discourses of the Buddha</cite> and on Access to Insight.</p>
<p>The five books are named according to various principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vol. 1 Sagāthāvagga contains sets of discourses that contain verses, as indicated by the title.</li>
<li>Vols. 2–4 are each named after the first and largest <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i> of the book.</li>
<li>Vol. 5 is called the “Great Book” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">Mahāvagga</i>) due to its size. The Chinese version is called, appropriately, “The Book of the Path” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">Maggavagga</i>).</li>
</ul>
<p>In this essay I will give an overview of each of the five books. However, I will not summarize each of the 56 <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i>, for that would make it far too long. For such summaries, see the lists of suttas on SuttaCentral, which include explanations of the various structural levels of the <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i>, as well as individual discourses. Here I will focus more on general questions of content and interpretation.</p>
<h2 id="intro-item2">The Book With Verses</h2>
<p>The “Book With Verses” (Sagāthāvagga) is divided into eleven <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i>, with a total of 271 suttas.</p>
<p>While most of the Saṁyutta is organized around subject matter, here the organizational principle is <em>people</em>. Each <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i> depicts a conversation involving the Buddha or his disciples with a different person or kind of person, such as gods, kings, nuns, or brahmins.</p>
<p>A typical sutta has a bare narrative framework, where someone comes to the Buddha and utters a verse, and the Buddha replies with a better one. In some cases, notably the Sakka Saṁyutta, the narrative element is developed into a lively exchange.</p>
<h3>Verse & Prose</h3>
<p>Each of the suttas in this collection contains verse with a prose narrative background, although in many cases the prose has been omitted through abbreviation. This kind of literary form is common in Indic literature, so it is worth spending a little time to understand it.</p>
<p>The oldest Indic literature is the Ṛg Veda, a collection of about 10,600 verses. These were passed down in the oral tradition of the brahmins for thousands of years. One of the keys to the accurate transmission of this sacred lore was the use of meter: rhythmic patterns of long and short syllables. Such meters provide a scaffolding that organizes words, and hence knowledge, in a form that is as memorable as a song; indeed, they would have been sung in a simple melody. In this way, the verses become set in a precise and defined form, one that may be preserved and passed down unaltered through the generations.</p>
<p>But poetry is not just technically complex; it is ecstatic, inspired, divine. The brahmins did not see the Vedas as being authored in the normal sense, but channeled as the divine word of god (Brahmā) through human sages (Pali: <i lang="pli" translate="no">isi</i>; Sanskrit: <i lang="pli" translate="no">ṛṣi</i>). The Vedic verses constantly allude to stories, myths, and events—for example, the slaying of the dragon Vṛtra by the god-hero Indra—that were well known to their audience, and thus did not require spelling out in the text itself. The verses are hymns, invoked in ritual to heighten the emotional response, to inspire awe, fear, or devotion. They are given meaning and context by the background understanding of the mythology. Thus the verses imply a story, of which they are the emotional and narrative climax.</p>
<p>So we can think of a verse as the seed crystal around which a more flexible prose narrative grows and evolves. The prose may be adjusted to time and place, presented in greater or lesser detail, or adapted for the audience. It may comment on contemporary events or express a personal perspective, but the verse is (in theory) always the same.</p>
<p>We are speaking here of the verses found in the Sagāthāvagga. But it is worth bearing in mind that there are plenty of verses in the <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i> outside the Sagāthāvagga, and they are not all of the same type. Here is a summary of the main verse types you will encounter. This is just to help a reader get a rough orientation, and exceptions and blurred lines are easily found.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Climactic verse</dt>
<dd>As in the Sagāthāvagga, such verses appear at the climax of a narrative. The narrative may be very thin, or even absent, yet it is always assumed. Sometimes it is supplied in later commentaries. This form is used outside the Sagāthāvagga in such texts as the Dhammapada, Udāna, and Jātakas. We might also consider under this head longer devotional verses such as those of Sela (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn92">MN 92</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/snp3.7">Snp 3.7</a>).</dd>
<dt>Independent poems</dt>
<dd>A set of verses that makes up a unified literary and thematic whole, and is independent of a prose narrative. There are relatively few of these in the four <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i>, but they dominate the Sutta Nipāta. The last <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> of that book contains a series of such independent poems, all united within a narrative set in verse. Some of the verses of the Sagāthāvagga might be considered under this head, if the prose narrative is dismissed as negligible.</dd>
<dt>Devotional invocations</dt>
<dd>Such texts as the Mahāsamaya Sutta (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn20">DN 20</a>), the Āṭāṇātiya Sutta (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn32">DN 32</a>), or the Isigili Sutta (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn116">MN 116</a>) occupy an unusual place in the early Buddhist corpus. Thin in their doctrinal content, they appear more as incantations for protection or blessings.</dd>
<dt>Summary verse</dt>
<dd>Like the climactic verses, these accompany prose. But rather than being an emotional highlight, they serve as a mnemonic device to help preserve the content of the prose. These are most familiar in the <i lang="pli" translate="no">uddānas</i> that appear at the end of <i lang="pli" translate="no">vaggas</i> and other sections throughout the EBTs, typically listing a keyword from each text and thus acting as a kind of table of contents. These are not to be confused with the genre of climactic verse known as <i lang="pli" translate="no">udāna</i>, “inspired saying”, which, despite the similar spelling, is a completely different word. In addition to the formal <i lang="pli" translate="no">uddānas</i>, we can consider under this head many of the verses of the Aṅguttara, especially in the Fours, which often serve purely to summarize the content of the prose, although occasionally they are developed into a more satisfying poetic reflection on the theme. Occasionally a longer sutta will contain mixed portions of prose and summary verse, notably the Dvayatānupassanā Sutta (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/snp3.12">Snp 3.12</a>). A much later development of this style is found in the Lakkhaṇa Sutta (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn30">DN 30</a>).</dd>
</dl>
<p>In my translations, I have rendered verse as prose broken into lines, rarely attempting poetic virtue. To render these highly didactic verses, dense with doctrinal terms, into genuine English verse is no easy task. In many cases, especially with the summary verses, the text in Pali has little in the way of literary merit. Other texts, especially the later verses, display a learned command of complex and sophisticated literary forms such as is rare to find, even among writers of English poetry. Combined with the often obscure vocabulary, rare and archaic grammatical forms, and syntactic flexibility of Pali verses, the task of rendering them in readable and accurate English is hard and time-consuming, even without aspiring to poetic beauty. So my verse is workmanlike, and I can only hope that poets take up the task of rendering selected verses with the beauty they deserve.</p>
<h3>The Play of the Gods</h3>
<p>In the Book With Verses we see the ancient Vedic pattern adopted to serve a Buddhist purpose. It is no coincidence that here we meet various deities, many of whom hail from Vedic mythology, in contexts that sometimes directly respond to specific Vedic or Brahmanical passages.</p>
<p>The casual appearance of deities throughout these texts is, of course, problematic. These days, we don’t normally see gods manifesting with glorious light at spiritual gatherings. So how are we to understand this?</p>
<p>One obvious answer is that such texts are literally true: gods of these names did appear in exactly the way depicted and have these exact conversations. If so, why are such things not seen in our day? One might be tempted to point regretfully to the decline of religious and ethical life in modern times. But this is just another unverifiable claim: how could we possibly know such a thing? And it creates an even bigger problem. For when we see the past as a uniquely privileged era, one blessed with a degree of purity and wholesomeness that is lost to us, then what is the point of practice? Are we not better off pining for the glories of old, and wishing for the renewal of the Dhamma under the future Buddha Metteyya? Such views forget a basic principle of the teaching: it is <i lang="pli" translate="no">akāliko</i>—we can realize it here & now, no matter when we live.</p>
<p>So perhaps we are better off adopting a skeptical view: such deities do not exist, and such events did not happen. They are simply religious propaganda, fictions whose purpose is to convert simple people by importing a familiar Indic cosmology. If there is any reality at all to them, it is purely psychological; such beings represent different aspects of the mind. Despite its scientific appearance, this reductive view, too, is unsustainable. The ideas of rebirth and the existence of multiple dimensions of existence are not found just in popular narratives, but are central to core teachings such as dependent origination and the four noble truths—the second noble truth is precisely “the craving that leads to future rebirth” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">yāyaṁ taṇhā ponobbhavikā</i>). They can’t be simply written off as an uncritical inheritance from Indian culture.</p>
<p>These views are polar opposites; and like all pairs of opposites, they share more in common than they like to admit. Both of them are concerned with <em>facts</em>, with whether these events were true or not. But the texts as we have them are not collections of facts: they are stories. And the significance of a story lies in its meaning. Whether a story is real or not is at best secondary, and often beside the point entirely. It serves to engage an audience, provoking wonder, surprise, awe, or joy.</p>
<p>The Buddhist traditions understood this well, as evidenced by the textual situation. While in some cases the verses and story are tightly linked, it is very common for the same verse to be accompanied by completely different background narratives, or by no background at all. The verses, which convey the essential Dhamma teaching, the core of meaning and emotion, remain the same, while the story varies. To insist on the factuality or otherwise of the story is to miss the point. The story provides a context that brings the teaching in the verses to life for an audience.</p>
<p>Thus the best lens through which to see such texts is neither as history nor as propaganda but as sacred story; that is, as myth. Each of the short suttas tells a story that conveys a timeless spiritual truth in a way that spoke to the audience of that time and place. They take place within a wider mythology that helps people find their place in a vast and unknown cosmos.</p>
<p>As always, the early Buddhist response to the earlier religious traditions is complex and nuanced. And, while it is true that many of the details of both literary form and subject matter are drawn from the Vedas, it is in the differences that the distinctively Buddhist character of the texts shows itself.</p>
<p>In the Vedas, the human agents are merely the transmitters of the sacred word of the gods. Exactly how this happened is unclear, but it probably involved a combination of drugs (<i lang="pli" translate="no">soma</i> is one of the great Vedic deities), ritual, creative inspiration, traditional lore, devotion, and communal empowerment, all of which inspired the sacred poets to heights of ecstatic visioning through which the words of the gods manifested. But regardless of the details, the key point is that the traditions regarded the human agent in the relationship as incidental, and the real value of the texts as stemming from the divine.</p>
<p>In the Buddhist texts, the situation is reversed. The gods do not inspire human hosts, they speak for themselves. And they are no infallible reserves of Truth; they may be right or wrong, skillful or foolish, just like anyone else. While the magnificence of their presence is emphasized, the ultimate effect is to show the worthlessness of such displays, for the gods are constantly being schooled by the Buddha. The most characteristic form of dialogue is where a god presents an idea that is pretty good, within a limited, mundane (i.e. Vedic) worldview, but which the Buddha elevates to an entirely new level.</p>
<p>It is an elementary axiom of Buddhism that the gods are not metaphysical, in the sense that they do not exist in a separate realm governed by different principles than our own. On the contrary, they are impermanent and suffering, trapped in the cycle of transmigration just like us. It follows from this that they do not have access to any special form of knowledge or wisdom. Buddhists do not look to the gods for teachings; rather, the Buddha is “teacher of gods and humans”.</p>
<p>I have focused on the interactions with divine beings in this collection, as these require the most contextualizing. But not all of the collections feature divine beings. Many of the <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i> feature kinds of people familiar from other texts of the time. And even when divine beings are involved, in the majority of cases, the verses themselves do not require a divine setting, as there’s nothing about the gods and their divine dramas in the verses themselves.</p>
<p>Some of the texts in this collection are well-known and widely quoted, such as the invitation of Brahmā or the nun Vajirā’s simile of the person as a chariot. Most of the suttas here have parallels in the Chinese Saṁyuktāgama translations; the partial translations SA-2 and SA-3 include Sagāthāvagga material. In addition, many of the verses have parallels elsewhere throughout the Buddhist literature in all languages.</p>
<h2 id="intro-item3">The Book of Causation</h2>
<p>The Book of Causation (Nidānavagga) is the second of the five books of the Linked Discourses. It is named after the first and longest section, the Nidāna Saṁyutta. This deals with causation through the core Buddhist teaching of dependent origination, which explains how rebirth happens without a soul. The next three <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i> can be seen as appendices to the Book of Causation, dealing with the elimination of the suffering of transmigration (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn13">SN 13</a>), various sets of conditioned elements (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn14">SN 14</a>), and the unknowability of the extent of transmigration (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn15">SN 15</a>). The remaining six <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i> are not related thematically. Instead, they are mostly grouped by person rather than subject.</p>
<p>The theme of causation runs through all the Buddha’s teaching. We find it in contexts such as meditation practice, societal ills, biological evolution, medicine, psychological stress, and many more. However, when we refer to dependent origination we are not speaking about a general principle of causality—although such a principle is presented at <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.21">SN 12.21</a>—but of a specific series of conditional links laying bare how suffering originates and how it ends. As such, it is an extended treatment of the second and third noble truths (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.27">SN 12.27</a>). It integrates psychological and existential aspects of suffering, showing how, when bound by craving, we make choices that bind us to transmigrating into future lives (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.38">SN 12.38</a>). The reason why we have not escaped the process of rebirth is that we do not understand dependent origination (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.60">SN 12.60</a>). Thus one of the core purposes of the teaching is to explain how rebirth takes place without speaking in terms of “me” or “mine” (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.37">SN 12.37</a>).</p>
<p>It is a deeply human need to want to understand how things came to be. Virtually every religious or spiritual path feels the need to offer some kind of explanation of where this world came from and what is our place in it. Such creation myths are found all over the world, and bear striking resemblances. They speak of a time when the world was formless, covered in watery darkness, before light appeared and the world took shape. In the usual way of myths, these stories work at multiple levels, reflecting both the physical evolution of the planet (macrocosm) and the growth of an individual in the womb (microcosm).</p>
<p>Long before the Buddha, the Nasadiya Sukta of the Ṛg Veda (10.129) told the story of creation in a radically new way. It drew upon the motifs of the classic creation myth—water, darkness, formlessness—but showed their development with a new emphasis on desire and agency. Creation evolved not from divine decree, but due to the energies found within. And we cannot know what came before this process; even the highest God came afterward.</p>
<p>The Buddha shared the epistemological humility of the Nasadiya Sukta, insisting that the ultimate origin of things was unknowable (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn15.1">SN 15.1</a>). Dependent origination, indeed, took things much further, entirely dispensing with both theology and mythology. However, it retained the richness and depth of the mythology, encapsulating within its sparse formulation both immediate experience and cosmic transmigration.</p>
<p>The Nidāna Saṁyutta begins by stating (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.1">SN 12.1</a>) and defining (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.2">SN 12.2</a>) each of the terms in the standard 12-linked chain, definitions which are assumed to apply throughout. Remaining discourses iterate on this theme, introducing new perspectives and formulations. These sometimes vary the standard 12 links, and so can shed light on unexpected nuances and hidden depths. Here’s a summary of the definitions given for the 12 links, together with some explanatory notes.</p>

<aside class="list-note">The Indic term <em>saṅkhāra</em> may refer to any kind of activity that generates a result. It is used in a mundane context for such things as construction work. The Vedic ritual is a <em>saṅkhāra</em>, which was intended to produce a result of benefit in this life or the next. In Buddhism, <em>saṅkhāra</em> is sometimes used in a general sense of “conditioned (and conditioning) phenomena”. In dependent origination, however, it is defined as moral choices or intentions to do good or bad (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.51">SN 12.51</a>). A <em>saṅkhāra</em> is a force or energy in the mind that propels consciousness towards rebirth in a particular state. This may be consciously formulated as a wish or aspiration (see <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn120">MN 120</a>), but is normally unconscious, i.e. born out of ignorance.</aside>

<dt>Consciousness (<i lang="pli" translate="no">viññāṇa</i>)</dt>
<dd>The six kinds of sense consciousness.
<aside class="list-note">In the suttas, all forms of consciousness are regarded as making up the “stream of consciousness” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">viññāṇasota</i>) that is established both in this life and the next (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn28">DN 28</a>). This consciousness is empowered and directed by the choices that we have made.</aside>
</dd>
<dt>Name & form (<i lang="pli" translate="no">nāma-rūpa</i>)</dt>
<dd>“Name” is various mental factors (feeling, perception, attention, contact, and intention), while “form” is the four material elements that make up the body.
<aside class="list-note">This is a tricky concept. It stems from Upaniṣadic usage, where it refers to the various individuated entities in the world, each with their own “form” and “name”. Each of the rivers on the earth, to take a metaphor from the Prasna Upaniṣad (6.5), has its own shape, and is called by its own name; but when they return to the ocean they lose their names and shapes and are just known as the great ocean. The ocean in this metaphor stands for consciousness, which in the Upaniṣads is taken to be the eternal and infinite divinity of the cosmos. The Buddha directly rebuts this idea by showing that consciousness and name & form are dependent on each other. In <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn15">DN 15</a> <cite class="text-translated">The Great Discourse on Causation</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Mahānidānasutta</cite>), name & form is described as the embryo taking shape within the mother’s womb, while <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn38">MN 38</a> <cite class="text-translated">The Longer Discourse on the Ending of Craving</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Mahātaṇhāsaṅkhaya</cite>) speaks of how the child then grows and matures. Thus it primarily means the individual organism with its mental and physical attributes. Since <i lang="pli" translate="no">nāma-rūpa</i> stands in mutual dependence with consciousness, however, it is not correct to translate it as “mind & body”—mind/body dualism has no place in early Buddhism. It was only in much later Abhidhamma texts that <i lang="pli" translate="no">nāma-rūpa</i> came to be used as an umbrella term for all mental and physical properties, in which context the translation “mind & body” is appropriate.</aside>

<dd>Craving or desire for the six sense stimuli.
<aside class="list-note">Here the definition follows the theme of the six senses, rather than the definition given in the four noble truths, which is craving for future rebirth, i.e. sensual craving, craving to continue existence, and craving to end existence.

This represents a further stage in the growth of a person, as they mature and become fully responsible for their actions.

Most beings are attached to the sensual realm, but those who have practiced advanced meditation may become attached to the realms of luminous form (through the four absorptions) or the formless (through the formless attainments). Such attachment or grasping stimulates and activates these aspects of existence, creating a corresponding rebirth. <i lang="pli" translate="no">Bhava</i> is therefore like a thread that runs through the various steps of dependent origination; and indeed, the whole of dependent origination is sometimes called the <i lang="pli" translate="no">bhavacakka</i>, the “Wheel of Existence”. <i lang="pli" translate="no">Bhava</i> is a countable noun, so the older rendering as “becoming” is incorrect: you can’t speak of multiple “becomings”. Nevertheless, <i lang="pli" translate="no">bhava</i> has a distinctly pregnant sense.

</dl>
<p>Dependent origination is core to the insight not just of the historical Buddha Gotama, but of other Buddhas of the past (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.4">SN 12.4–10</a>). His realization was like a person who stumbles upon an ancient city, lost and overgrown in the jungle (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.65">SN 12.65</a>). Thus dependent origination is not an invention of the Buddha but is a description of a natural principle, one that operates in the same way whether or not a Buddha appears (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.20">SN 12.20</a>).</p>
<p>The Buddha distinguished between the phenomena that are dependently originated and the process of dependent origination (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.20">SN 12.20</a>). While all of the dependently originated phenomena can be seen in the present, the reality of the process in the past and future must be inferred (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.34">SN 12.34</a>).</p>
<p>This is the difference between knowledge of dependent origination and the psychic powers of seeing the specific details of past lives and present rebirths. Such psychic visions arise from deep immersion in meditation, and are useful but not essential for understanding and letting go. Dependent origination is not about seeing the specifics of past and future lives, but understanding the principles by which rebirth operates. If memories of past lives are like watching a show on TV, insight into dependent origination is like understanding the science and technology of how television transmission works. This is why dependent origination is always regarded as unique and central to Buddhism, while psychic visions have only a limited role to play.</p>
<p>This conscious body, with its complex systems of mental and physical processes, was produced due to ignorance and craving in a past life (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.19">SN 12.19</a>). This is how our present existence came to be. So long as we continue to be trapped in craving for sensory experience, we repeat the cycle, fueling craving and generating yet another new body that will be reborn in the future. When we understand the theory of dependent origination it gives us an opening for developing insight.</p>
<p>It is, of course, self-evident that all the factors of dependent origination may be observed in the present. But in terms of the functioning of the process, we begin by examining the central factors, the unfolding of sense experience. Gradually we realize that the implications of what we are seeing are far deeper than the mere present. Like a scientist who, examining tree rings or ice cores, realizes that they can make reliable inferences about the deep past, we understand that the same processes that brought us here will propel us into the future. And we see that it is that very understanding which is the beginning of the end for ignorance.</p>
<p>Thus while this teaching is a profoundly philosophical one, it is not mere theory, but a praxis as well (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.3">SN 12.3</a>). Its understanding unfolds as a natural consequence of developing faith in the Dhamma (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.23">SN 12.23</a>). It is realized by one who has experiential realization of the Dhamma, commonly known as a stream-enterer (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.28">SN 12.28</a>). This is true for both monastics (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.29">SN 12.29</a>) and lay people (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.41">SN 12.41</a>). This is why a noble disciple has no doubts about the meaning or origin of life: they have seen it for themselves (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.49">SN 12.49</a>). Such an individual is independent of others and need not rely on a teacher. One need not be a perfected one (<i lang="pli" translate="no">arahant</i>) to understand dependent origination (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.68">SN 12.68</a>).</p>
<p>The Buddha illustrates dependent origination with many similes, drawing imagery from fire, fuel, or food. Focusing on things that give pleasure tends to stimulate craving, like a fire fueled by dry grass (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.52">SN 12.52</a>) or a tree drawing up sap (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.58">SN 12.58</a>). It is in this collection that we find the now-classic simile of the mind like a monkey, although the application is somewhat unexpected (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.61">SN 12.61</a>).</p>
<p>Several suttas take up the idea of conditionality as “food” or “fuel” or “sustenance” and apply it to a set of four things: solid food, contact, intention, and consciousness (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.11">SN 12.11</a>). Each of these is, in turn, illustrated with similes that are as horrifying as they are unforgettable (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.63">SN 12.63</a>).</p>
<p>While the standard presentation of the 12 links might give the impression that they occur one after the other, like a series of dominoes falling down, the reality is more complex. Certain factors, such as consciousness and name & form, are interdependent, relying on each other (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.65">SN 12.65</a>) like two sheaves of reeds (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.67">SN 12.67</a>). Sometimes a factor might be implied rather than mentioned outright (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.13">SN 12.13</a>), sometimes the sequence is altered (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.43">SN 12.43</a> and <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.44">SN 12.44</a>), while elsewhere the teaching might be presented in a quite different way (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.38">SN 12.38</a>). Conditionality in Buddhism is always understood to be complex and ramified: many causes, many effects, all interacting. The simple schema is not meant to be reductive, but to clarify crucial aspects of the process in a way that is easily memorized and understood.</p>
<p>Philosophically, dependent origination is said to be the “middle teaching” that avoids extreme views. Such extreme views are the polar opposites that often define philosophical positions. They include views of moral responsibility: is the person who does the deed identical to the one who experiences the result? Or is it experienced by a different person? The Buddha rejects these alternatives: the deed has an effect, and that effect is suffering (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.46">SN 12.46</a>).</p>
<p>Similarly the Buddha rejects the ideas that “everything exists” or that “nothing exists” (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.48">SN 12.48</a>). While these notions might seem odd, even bizarre, to our way of thinking, they stem from the Indian philosophical tendency to see “being” as inherent, absolute, even divine. Thus if something exists, it exists in an absolute and essential sense, and if all exists, it means the reality of the cosmos itself is absolute and eternal. If nothing “exists”, it does not mean that there is nothing real in the world; it means that things do not have any essence, and so will perish. Thus the Buddha rejects these opposing views as forms of eternalism and annihilationism, the ideas that the self will last forever, and that the self will be destroyed (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.15">SN 12.15</a>).</p>
<p>Finally, perhaps the single most important thing to remember is that dependent “origination” is only half the picture. Of equal importance is “cessation”, the ending of each of the factors, which is what is called “extinguishment” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">nibbāna</i>). The true purpose of studying dependent origination is not for philosophical mastery, not for winning debates or passing a course, but for realizing the ending of suffering. Dependent origination stands as a truly empowering teaching, as it assumes that human understanding is quite sufficient to comprehend the essence of existence itself, to find salvation through wisdom.</p>
<h2 id="intro-item4">The Book of the Aggregates</h2>
<p>The “Book of the Aggregates” is the third of the five books of the Linked Discourses. It is named after the first and longest <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i>, which deals with the core Buddhist teaching of the five aggregates in 159 discourses. Of the remaining twelve <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i>, three also take up the theme of the aggregates, while the remainder deal with miscellaneous secondary themes, some organized by subject, others by person.</p>
<p>The “five grasping aggregates” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">pañc’upādānakkhandhā</i>) were mentioned in the first sermon as the summary of the noble truth of suffering (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11">SN 56.11</a>), and became a foundational teaching in all forms of Buddhism.</p>
<p>The basic idea of an “aggregate” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">khandha</i>) is a set or class of phenomena. The “five aggregates” are the various sets of phenomena so classified.</p>
<p>The five aggregates are almost always said to be “grasping” aggregates. The term “grasping” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">upādāna</i>) has a complex and multi-layered relation to the basic term.</p>
<ul>
<li>The aggregates are the <em>subject</em> of grasping, in that they are the things that are normally attached to and taken to be the permanent “self”.</li>
<li>But they are not merely passive spectators: they are also the <em>functional support</em> of grasping, the things that make grasping work. This is probably the basic metaphor of the set, as the five aggregates correspond to the five fingers of a hand, which perform the act of grasping. Grasping is something that the aggregates do. In this metaphor, the “thumb” is consciousness, which stands against the other four.</li>
<li>As active participants in the process of grasping, they <em>stimulate</em> grasping to themselves (<i lang="pli" translate="no">upādāniya</i>).</li>
<li>And finally, they are the <em>product</em> of grasping in the sense that attachments in past lives have given rise to the aggregates in this life (<i lang="pli" translate="no">upādiṇṇa</i>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a brief analysis of each of the five.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Form (<i lang="pli" translate="no">rūpa</i>)</dt>
<dd>“Physical phenomena”, or sometimes simply “body”, understood as consisting of the four primary physical properties: earth (solid), water (liquidity), fire (heat), and air (gas), and anything material derived from these, such as the impressions of the five material senses.
<aside class="list-note"><i lang="pli" translate="no">Rūpa</i> is more extensive in scope than the Western concept of “matter”. It includes material properties that are perceived purely in the mind, such as shape or color seen as visions in meditation.</aside>
</dd>
<dt>Feeling (<i lang="pli" translate="no">vedanā</i>)</dt>
<dd>The pleasant, painful, or neutral tone of experience born from the six senses.</dd>
<dt>Perception (<i lang="pli" translate="no">saññā</i>)</dt>
<dd>The recognition or interpretation of experience through the six senses.
<aside class="list-note">Perception refers to that function of the mind which organizes the dizzyingly complex and chaotic input of present experience based on past experience. The eye, for example, does not see “blue” or “yellow”, it only sees light in various frequencies and amplitudes. Perception recognizes that these inputs correspond to the concept “blue” or “yellow” (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.79">SN 22.79</a>), and so it enables us to live in a world of (relatively) permanent and predictable entities and ideas. While perception thus makes consciousness possible, it also can trap us into seeing things only in terms of the past. In the legal discussions of the Vinaya, it is common to discuss cases where a mendicant’s actions are based on a perception that turns out to be incorrect.</aside>
</dd>
<dt>Choices (<i lang="pli" translate="no">saṅkhārā</i>)</dt>
<dd>Intention, will, or volition (<i lang="pli" translate="no">cetanā</i>); the choice to perform an act, especially one with an ethical dimension. It is choices that create the five aggregates (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.79">SN 22.79</a>).
<aside class="list-note">Later forms of Buddhism, starting with the Abhidhamma texts, treated this aggregate as if it were a catch-all, whose purpose was to include everything not mentioned under the other aggregates. However, this is not the case in the early texts, where there is no indication that <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṅkhārā</i> in this context means anything other than “volition, choice”.</aside>
</dd>
<dt>Consciousness (<i lang="pli" translate="no">viññāṇa</i>)</dt>
<dd>The subjective process of awareness itself.
<aside class="list-note">As in dependent origination, consciousness is said to depend on name & form.</aside>
</dd>
</dl>
<p> Except perception, all of these are also found in dependent origination, where they have similar definitions. Whereas dependent origination shows the unfolding of the process of suffering in time, the teaching on the aggregates focuses on those aspects of present experience that are most apt to be taken as a self. In <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.5">SN 22.5</a> the grasping to the aggregates is shown as the very same grasping that leads to rebirth as shown in dependent origination. <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.54">SN 22.54</a> furthers this argument, asserting that it is impossible to speak of rebirth without referring to the aggregates.</p>
<p>From the very first teaching of the Buddha (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11">SN 56.11</a>) we learn that the aggregates are suffering. In the second sermon—the Discourse on Not-Self (Anattalakkhaṇa Sutta) at <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.59">SN 22.59</a>—this brief statement is drawn out in further dialogue with the group of five ascetics. Each of the aggregates leads to affliction and one cannot simply decree that the aggregates be whatever one wants; hence they cannot be a self. Further, each of the aggregates is impermanent and therefore suffering, which again rules out the possibility that they are a self. Seeing in this way, a practitioner lets go of attachment to the aggregates and realizes freedom. It was while listening to this discourse that the five ascetics all became perfected ones.</p>
<p>While the doctrine of the “three marks” is found throughout all Buddhist texts, it is here in the Khandha Saṁyutta that it rises to prominence. Here is a brief outline.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Impermanence (<i lang="pli" translate="no">anicca</i>)</dt>
<dd>All conditioned phenomena are produced and maintained by causes and hence can only last so long as the causes sustain them. Impermanence is a fractal phenomenon; it is how reality is structured at every level. It applies equally to the grandest scale of universes and the lifespans of the gods as it does to the incessant breaking up and vanishing of conditions from moment to moment. But in the five aggregates, the main focus is on the scale of human existence, where the emotional impact of impermanence is felt most keenly in death.</dd>
<dt>Suffering (<i lang="pli" translate="no">dukkha</i>)</dt>
<dd>At its simplest level this refers to painful feelings, whether physical or mental (<i lang="pli" translate="no">dukkha-dukkhatā</i>). By itself, this is a profound observation, as virtually every moment of our waking lives is afflicted by some form of pain or irritation. But suffering runs deeper than that, for even when we do experience pleasure, it cannot be sustained. The second bite of a mango is delicious—but not quite as delicious as the first (<i lang="pli" translate="no">vipariṇāma-dukkhatā</i>). Finally, even the most profound of pleasures, such as the bliss of deep meditation, is never as peaceful as <i lang="pli" translate="no">nibbāna</i>, since by its nature it is conditioned and unstable (<i lang="pli" translate="no">saṅkhāradukkhatā</i>). No experience is as peaceful as cessation.</dd>
<dt>Not-self (<i lang="pli" translate="no">anattā</i>)</dt>
<dd>The most subtle and distinctive of the three marks, not-self is the most apt to be misunderstood. It is primarily an anti-metaphysical doctrine, not a psychological one. It is intended to rule out the various kinds of self or soul proposed by the philosophers at the time of the Buddha. It does this by pointing out that all the self doctrines end up identifying one or other of the aggregates as self; but they do not have the nature that the self is supposed to have. This meaning is quite different from the modern psychological notion of self, and it is inappropriate, and potentially harmful, to apply the teaching of not-self in cases where a person is suffering from a disorder of identity.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Let us dwell a little further on the idea of self and not-self, which is best understood in its historical context. From a few centuries before the Buddha, Indian sages and philosophers had become fascinated by the subjective nature of experience. They wondered who it was, in the true and ultimate sense, that was the one referred to as “I”.</p>
<p>Initial theories built on simple animist notions, imaging the self as an external physical totem, or even as a little man who lived in the chest. Others theorized that the self was the heart, or the breath, or some other physical attribute. But all of these may be refuted by simple empirical observation. Sometimes a totem may be destroyed, yet a person lives. When you watch a person who is asleep, no little man may be observed leaving by the mouth. And when a trumpeter expels all their breath, they do not drop down dead.</p>
<p>So what then is this self if not something material? Perhaps, rather, it is feeling, the bliss experienced by one who goes to a beautiful realm after death. But this cannot be so, for feeling, too, is impermanent (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn15">DN 15</a>). Then could the self be perception (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn1">DN 1</a>)? But no, perception too is tricky and unreliable, like an illusion. Is self then one’s choices? A man, after all, is defined by the decisions he makes. But these too are seen to be impermanent and unreliable; oft-times one makes bad choices, or the results of a choice are not what one hopes.</p>
<p>Unsatisfied, the sages of the Upaniṣads rejected all such limited conceptions of the Self (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 3.9.26: <i lang="san" translate="no">neti! neti!</i>). They arrived at their most profound thesis: the self in its highest sense was awareness itself, the sheer mass of consciousness (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4.12: <i lang="san" translate="no">vijnāna-ghanam’eva</i>). The true nature of the self is the supreme divinity (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.4.10: <i lang="san" translate="no">ahaṁ brahmāsmīti</i>; cp. <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2">DN 1:2</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn11/en/sujato#81">DN 11:81</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn24/en/sujato#2">DN 24:2</a>: <i lang="san" translate="no">ahamasmi brahmā</i>). This insight is expressed in the Upaniṣads as the famous “thou art that” (Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.8.7: <i lang="san" translate="no">tat tvam asi</i>), and the Pali texts as “I am that” ( <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.8">SN 22.8</a>: <i lang="pli" translate="no">eso hamasmi</i>). “That” may be anything one identifies as self. But to one who understands rightly (<i lang="san" translate="no">ya evaṁ veda</i>) the divine self is nothing less than the entirety of the universe: “the self is identical with the cosmos” (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.81">SN 22.81</a>: <i lang="pli" translate="no">so attā so loko</i>, cp. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.2.7: <i lang="san" translate="no">tasyeme lokā ātmānaḥ</i>, 4.5.7: <i lang="san" translate="no">idaṁ brahmedaṁ kṣatram ime lokā ime devā ime vedā imāni bhūtānīdaṁ sarvaṁ yad ayam ātmā</i>). This philosophy is most closely associated with Yajnavalkya, a Brahmanical sage who lived in the same region as the Buddha (Mithilā), perhaps a century or two earlier.</p>
<p>While the exact form of these arguments may seem archaic, we still cling to the aggregates in similar ways. We think of our possessions and belongings—homes, clothes, cars—as expressions of our self, and are upset when they are damaged or criticized. We attach, too, to our physical bodies, reveling in health, or imagining that we will survive through the propagation of our DNA. We attach to pleasure, thinking that happiness will last. We attach to our perceptions, such as our sense of belonging to a nation or religion, or our idea of ourselves as a good person. We attach to our choices, taking pride in our ability to make decisions. Finally, we attach to our consciousness, especially as we purify awareness in meditation.</p>
<p>Thus one of the key functions of the aggregates was to categorize theories of the self, moving from simple to profound. This seems to have been familiar to philosophers before the Buddha. The aggregates are mentioned in passing in the first sermon as if it is taken for granted that the five ascetics would know them. Many of the sectarian views of self in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn1">DN 1</a> Brahmajala Sutta refer to the aggregates in one way or another. And elsewhere, the non-Buddhist ascetic Saccaka asserted that the five aggregates were the self (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn35">MN 35</a>). Nevertheless, the aggregates have not been identified in any pre-Buddhist texts.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the set of categories was pre-Buddhist, the Buddha treated them in his distinctive way, emphasizing that when examined, the aggregates turn out to lack the qualities of permanence, surety, and refuge that are intrinsic to the idea of a true self. But our grasping and identification are strong and have been built up over a long time, so it is not enough to merely acknowledge this on an intellectual level. Hence in the Khandha Saṁyutta we find the core teachings emphasized again and again. The Buddha constantly reminds the mendicants that the aggregates lead to sorrow and despair (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.7">SN 22.7</a>), that they are aggravating (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.79">SN 22.79</a>), that desire for them must be given up (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.137">SN 22.137</a>), that they are alien (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.33">SN 22.33</a>). One who identifies with the aggregates is like a man who hires an assassin as a servant (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.85">SN 22.85</a>). They are suffering in the past and future just as they are today (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.10">SN 22.10</a>).</p>
<p>The view that the aggregates are self is called “identity view” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">sakkāyadiṭṭhi</i>). It is possible to identify with any or all of the aggregates in a myriad of ways, commonly set out as twenty forms of identity view (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.1">SN 22.1</a>, etc.). Identity view leashes an unenlightened person to transmigration like a dog tied to a post, pointlessly running around and around (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.99">SN 22.99</a>).</p>
<p>Several discourses emphasize that to understand the aggregates it is essential to develop the deep stillness of immersion meditation (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.5">SN 22.5</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.6">SN 22.6</a>). But meditative realization is not something that just happens automatically; one must continually contemplate and observe the aggregates (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.40">SN 22.40</a>, etc.).</p>
<p>In this collection we find a large number of striking and lively narratives, showing how the aggregates could be a solace at the time of old age (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.1">SN 22.1</a>), a guide to the knotty theoretical debates on identity, or a framework for insight meditation.</p>
<h2 id="intro-item5">The Book of the Six Sense Fields</h2>
<p>The “Book of the Six Sense Fields” is the fourth of the five books of the Linked Discourses. It is named after the first and longest <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i>. The second <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i> on Feelings also deals with a major doctrinal topic, one that is closely related to the main theme. The remaining eight <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i> deal with secondary themes organized by subject or by person.</p>
<p>The number of discourses in the “Linked Discourses on the Six Sense Fields” varies between editions, mainly due to the way repetitions are counted; SuttaCentral follows Bhikkhu Bodhi’s translation in counting 248 discourses; see his introduction to this chapter for a discussion of the problems in counting the Suttas of this collection. They are collected in four <i lang="pli" translate="no">paṇṇasakas</i>.</p>
<p>This <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i> has an especially close relationship with the “Linked Discourses on the Aggregates”, one that goes far beyond the apparent thematic similarities. Many of the discourses in the two collections are constructed on virtually identical lines. Bhikkhu Bodhi explores these connections with his notion of “template parallels”, which are found throughout the Saṁyutta Nikāya, but especially with these two sections.</p>
<p>The six sense fields complement the five aggregates as the summary of the noble truth of suffering. Where the aggregates focus on the functional structure of experience as a basis for views of self, the emphasis here is on how sense experience stimulates desire.</p>
<p>The six sense fields are the means through which the world is known, and so each of them has two aspects. The “inner” aspect is the sense organs, for example the “eye” or the “ear”, which make it possible for an organism to experience the outside world by receiving sense stimuli. These are paired with the external sensory stimuli, such as “sights” or “sounds”, which impact the sense organ (contact, <i lang="pli" translate="no">phassa</i>) and give rise to the appropriate form of consciousness.</p>
<p>It’s best to avoid thinking of the external sense fields as “objects”, since in the suttas they are depicted in relation to the observing mind, and not as independently existing entities. There is no word for “object” in this sense in the early texts: existence is not objective, it is relational. The term <i lang="pli" translate="no">ārammaṇa</i>, which came to be used in this sense much later in the Abhidhamma, means “support” in the suttas.</p>
<p>The operation of the senses is relatively straightforward until we come to the last sense, the “mind” and “thoughts” or “mental phenomena”. To clear up possible confusion, this “sixth sense” is simply the mental faculty and has nothing to do with psychic powers. And unlike the five external senses, the “inner” sense field is not a physical organ: <i lang="pli" translate="no">mano</i> does not mean “brain”.</p>
<p>The exact meaning of “mind” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">mano</i>) in this context is not spelled out, so let us consider this first. The suttas use three main terms for the mind: <i lang="pli" translate="no">mano</i>, <i lang="pli" translate="no">citta</i>, and <i lang="pli" translate="no">viññāṇa</i>. In general, these are synonyms and it is not possible to draw hard and fast distinctions between them (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.60">AN 3.60</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn1/en/sujato#2">DN 1:2</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.61">SN 12.61</a>). Nevertheless, they tend to be used in different contexts, each with a distinct nuance. These contexts can be understood in terms of the four noble truths; thus the different terms refer to the same thing but imply a different aspect or response to that thing.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<i lang="pli" translate="no">Viññāṇa</i>
</dt>
<dd>In doctrinal contexts this is awareness itself, the sheer knowing of things. It appears in this sense in dependent origination, the aggregates, and the sense fields. Hence it pertains to the first noble truth, the suffering of the world, and it needs to be fully understood. In colloquial usage, however, it can take on a variety of shades of meaning, such as “understanding”.</dd>
<dt>
<i lang="pli" translate="no">Mano</i>
</dt>
<dd>The mind in action, one of the three spheres of <i lang="pli" translate="no">kamma</i>, a sense it inherits from the Upaniṣads. It is that which creates results, as in the famous first line of the Dhammapada: <i lang="pli" translate="no">mano pubbaṅgamā dhammā</i>, “mind is the forerunner of all things”. It is particularly used in ethical contexts, the performance of mental acts that bear fruit of either good or bad. So it may be understood as primarily relating to the second and third noble truths, the origination and ending of suffering.</dd>
<dt>
<i lang="pli" translate="no">Citta</i>
</dt>
<dd>The most general, and the least tightly bound to a particular technical sense. It is used widely as “mind”, “thought”, “heart”, etc. But when found in technical contexts it refers to <i lang="pli" translate="no">samādhi</i>, to the purified awareness of deep meditative immersion. For this reason, it is specially used in contexts relating to the path, the fourth noble truth.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the six senses, <i lang="pli" translate="no">mano</i> is clearly not identical with the “knowing” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">viññāṇa</i>), as it gives rise to it. Nor is it the “known”, the phenomena of which the mind is aware, for that is <i lang="pli" translate="no">dhammā</i>. Nor is it the turning towards or paying attention to the thing known, as is revealed in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn28">MN 28</a> <cite class="text-translated">The Longer Simile of the Elephant’s Footprint</cite> (<cite class="text-root">Mahāhatthipadopamasutta</cite>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though the mind is intact internally, so long as exterior thoughts don’t come into range and there’s no corresponding attention, there’s no manifestation of the corresponding type of consciousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage suggests that, like the physical sense organs, <i lang="pli" translate="no">mano</i> in some way pre-exists the actual moment of conscious awareness. This does not mean that it is some mystical substrata of consciousness, for as we have seen <i lang="pli" translate="no">mano</i> is consistently used in the sense of the mind that performs acts, especially those with a moral dimension. So the <i lang="pli" translate="no">mano</i> is that which has performed deeds in the past, fueling an ongoing mental continuum within which the results of those deeds may be experienced in the present. It is the mental faculty that bears the potential for conscious experience, created and conditioned by choices made in the past.</p>
<p>The “outer” aspect of the sixth sense is <i lang="pli" translate="no">dhammā</i>, a term so ambiguous its translation is always difficult. Here it refers to anything that may be known directly by the mind, distinct from the five physical senses. The most technically correct translation is probably “mental phenomena”. However, this is clumsy and opaque, so “thought” may be used as a more colloquial rendering, so long as it is understood to include ideas, imagination, and so on, not just verbalized cognition.</p>
<p>The term <i lang="pli" translate="no">āyatana</i> refers to something “stretched out”, a domain, field, or dimension of activity. However, the Visuddhimagga suggests that the sense of the word is primarily a “cause”, or perhaps “stimulus”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… base (<i lang="pli" translate="no">āyatana</i>) should be understood as such (a) because of its actuating (<i lang="pli" translate="no">āyatana</i>), (b) because of being the range (<i lang="pli" translate="no">tanana</i>) of the origins (<i lang="pli" translate="no">āya</i>), and (c) because of leading on (<i lang="pli" translate="no">nayana</i>) what is actuated (<i lang="pli" translate="no">āyata</i>). <cite class="text-translated">Path of Purification</cite>, XV.4, translated by Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoḷi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bhikkhu Ñāṇamoḷi rendered the term accordingly as “base”, which has been followed by Bhikkhu Bodhi. But this commentarial explanation is merely a series of false etymologies, or rather, puns. The point of such explanations is to provide material for teachers to reflect on and use in teaching, and they shouldn’t be taken uncritically. In fact the verbal root is not the obscure <i lang="pli" translate="no">āyatati</i> (“to actuate”) but <i lang="pli" translate="no">āyamati</i>, “to stretch, to extend”. <i lang="pli" translate="no">Āyatana</i> is commonly used in this sense and may be translated as “field”, “dimension”, etc.</p>
<p>As so often, the context draws upon and redefines Brahmanical terminology. The “six sense fields” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">saḷāyatana</i>) were first mentioned in the Buddha’s third teaching, the famous Fire Discourse (Ādittapariyāya Sutta) which appears in this collection at <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.28">SN 35.28</a>. This sermon was given to a large assembly of Brahmanical ascetics, following a period when the Buddha stayed in their “firehouse”, a kind of shrine room for worshiping the sacred flame. And in Sanskrit, this place is called an <i lang="pli" translate="no">āyatana</i>. The Upaniṣads also call the senses <i lang="pli" translate="no">āyatana</i> in the sense of fields or scopes of activity and experience (eg. Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 4.1.4: <i lang="san" translate="no">cakṣur evāyatanam</i>, Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 6.1.5: <i lang="san" translate="no">mano vā āyatanam</i>; Chāndogya Upaniṣad 5.1.5: <i lang="san" translate="no">mano ha vā āyatanam</i>).</p>
<p>When the Buddha told those ascetics that “all is burning”, he was not giving an Abhidhamma analysis, for it was many centuries before Abhidhamma was developed. He was speaking in terms that the brahmins could understand.</p>
<p>One of the key projects of the Brahmanical Upaniṣads was to reinterpret the deities of the Vedas. Rather than thinking of them as entities who lived in the sky, they became forces or essences that imbued all of reality. So for the brahmin ascetics, the flame (<i lang="san" translate="no">agni</i>) was worshiped as the embodiment of a sacred energy that was immanent in all things.</p>
<p>The teachings of the Fire Sermon respond to several key Upaniṣadic passages. In Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 1.3, it is told how evil entered into the world by the actions of the demons (<i lang="pli" translate="no">asuras</i>). While the gods (<i lang="pli" translate="no">devas</i>) were performing the ritual, they entered into the various senses and corrupted them, tainting them with evil and death. Hence when suffering is experienced through the senses, this is the reason. But those same senses can be freed from this corruption by being carried beyond death.</p>
<p>These purified, divine senses are further described at Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.5.1, the famous “Honey-Knowledge”, regarded as one of the highest and most secret teachings. It presents a template, applied to various kinds of things. These are not organized as rationally as the Buddhist doctrines but include quite different kinds of things in the same set, such as the elements, truth, the sun, etc. Nevertheless, the parallels with the teachings of the six senses are quite apparent.</p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p><i lang="san" translate="no">ayam ādityaḥ sarveṣāṁ bhūtānāṁ madhu</i> <br/>This sun is the honey of all beings. <br/><i lang="san" translate="no">asyādityasya sarvāṇi bhūtāni madhu</i> <br/>All beings are the honey of the sun. <br/><i lang="san" translate="no">yaś cāyam asminn āditye tejomayo ’mṛtamayaḥ puruṣo yaś cāyam adhyātmaṁ cākṣuṣas tejomayo ’mṛtamayaḥ puruṣo ’yam eva sa yo ’yam ātmā</i> <br/>This person in the sun made of fire and immortality, and this person in the internal eye made of fire and immortality: this is that—that which is the self. <br/><i lang="san" translate="no">idam amṛtam idaṁ brahmedaṁ sarvam</i> <br/>This is the immortal, this is the divine, this is the all. <br/>(Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.5.5, translation by myself.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Brahmanical view is that all creation stems from Brahmā and hence is, in its truest essence, overflowing with divinity and bliss—honey. Any suffering is merely a temporary imperfection.</p>
<p>This is how they handled the great challenge to any theistic system, the problem of evil. For the brahmins, to focus on suffering is to miss the point. This is not merely a facile “positive thinking” doctrine, it is a profoundly contemplative philosophy, worked out in great detail across many complex sacred texts, and informed by deep meditative practice. It does not deny the reality of suffering, but it evokes a deeper reality that suffering cannot reach.</p>
<p>Rather than tackling the textual and philosophical issues, the Buddha preferred to point directly at experience. Divested of theology, the experience of our senses is not “honey” but “fire”. And while our philosophy may say that fire is sacred, the reality is that it burns. The Buddha was showing the ascetics that there is no need to invoke deities and metaphysics to understand their experience: they could see how it worked right here.</p>
<p>The forces lighting that fire can be readily discerned: greed, hate, and delusion. This classic Buddhist presentation of the fundamental defilements appears first in this passage. It is correlated with the three feelings: pleasant feeling stimulates desire; painful feeling provokes hate; and neutral feeling slips into delusion (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn44/en/sujato#25">MN 44:25</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn128/en/sujato#28">MN 128:28</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn36.3">SN 36.3</a>).</p>
<p>The Fire Sermon, in its brevity, foreshadows several distinctive features of the teachings on the six senses as compared to the five aggregates. It is direct, emotional, and powerful, speaking of the world that is burning, in contrast with the more intellectual approach of the aggregates.</p>
<p>By invoking the idea of the “all”, the Fire Sermon suggests that the scope of the six senses includes all that is experienced and known. This idea was expanded in multiple Suttas (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.33">SN 35.33–52</a>). By contrast, no such claim to completeness is made of the aggregates. And the text treats sense experience as a conditioned process, the immediately visible dimension of dependent origination.</p>
<p>Since the sense fields make experience possible, it is through them that suffering comes to be (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.106">SN 35.106</a>). It is in order to understand this suffering that one undertakes the spiritual path (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.81">SN 35.81</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.152">SN 35.152</a>). The sense fields are, in fact, the world (<i lang="pli" translate="no">loka</i>) that wears away (<i lang="pli" translate="no">lujjati</i>; <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.82">SN 35.82</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.84">SN 35.84</a>), for “whatever in the world through which you perceive the world and conceive the world is called the world in the training of the noble one” (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.116">SN 35.116</a>). This world is empty of self (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.85">SN 35.85</a>).</p>
<p>Since the sense fields are produced by choices made in past lives, they are said to be “old kamma”; in this, they contrast with the aggregates, for they include “choices”, which are the kamma made in the present. Having inherited the senses as the result of past deeds, however, we proceed to respond to them through thinking or conceiving of them in terms of a “self”, a process known in Pali as “identifying” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">maññita</i>; <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.146">SN 35.146</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.30">SN 35.30–32</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.90">SN 35.90–91</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.248">SN 35.248</a>).</p>
<p>“Conceiving” and the closely related “conceit” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">māna</i>) refer to the tendency of the mind to shape experience in terms of the self. Much of our thought is devoted to justifying, explaining, and interpreting our experience in ways that reinforce our notion of self. This can end up spinning out of control, in which case it is called “proliferation” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">papañca</i>). To cut through this process the Buddha urges us to stop short with sense experience (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.94">SN 35.94</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.95">SN 35.95</a>).</p>
<p>It is significant that, while the texts repeatedly speak of how the aggregates form the basis for theories of self (<i lang="pli" translate="no">sakkāya</i>), the same is <em>not</em> said of the sense fields. If the aggregates provoke grasping to theories, the sense fields provoke grasping at <em>pleasure</em>, at the sheer vitality of sensory experience. Thus while the teachings on the aggregates emphasize <em>views</em>, here the focus shifts to <em>restraint</em>. A standard passage on sense restraint, familiar from the Gradual Training, speaks of preventing harmful qualities from invading the mind amid sense experience (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.120">SN 35.120</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.127">SN 35.127</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.239">SN 35.239</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.240">SN 35.240</a>). A person who chases the pleasure afforded by the senses is no less trapped by the pain they bring, and it is only by setting up mindfulness that one can achieve peace (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.132">SN 35.132</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.243">SN 35.243–244</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.247">SN 35.247</a>).</p>
<p>In this way, by choosing the sense fields as a locus of practice one cuts directly at the roots of craving. This is emphasized in the final two <i lang="pli" translate="no">vaggas</i>, which are especially rich in unforgettable imagery. The senses are an ocean traversed during the spiritual journey (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.228">SN 35.228</a>). We’d be better off being tortured by hot pokers than being caught up in sense experience (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.235">SN 35.235</a>). If you wish to train in meditation, you must learn to withdraw the senses like a tortoise drawing in its limbs, becoming safe from predators (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.240">SN 35.240</a>). Pleasant experiences are the bait of Māra (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.230">SN 35.230</a>). The six senses are like six very different animals, all tied together, and fighting to get to their territory (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.247">SN 35.247</a>).</p>
<h2 id="intro-item6">The Great Book</h2>
<p>The “Great Book” is the last and largest of the five books of the Linked Discourses. It consists of twelve <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i>, almost all of which deal with an aspect of Buddhist practice, or the path. The first of these, indeed, is the “Section on the Path” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">Magga Saṁyutta</i>), and in the northern canons the book as a whole is referred to as the “Book of the Path” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">Maggavagga</i>).</p>
<p>The first seven <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i> offer a detailed treatment of seven sets of factors on Buddhist practice. These sets came to be known to the later traditions as the 37 <i lang="pli" translate="no">bodhipakkhiyā dhammā</i>, or “qualities leading to awakening”. Note that this term is not used in this way in the suttas; it is, rather, applied to one of the sets, the five faculties (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.55">SN 48.55</a>, etc.). While the 37 factors are mentioned throughout the canon, it is in this book that we find the primary source for these teachings. Subsequent <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i> deal with the path from different perspectives, while the final two deal with stream-entry and the four noble truths respectively.</p>
<p>While most books of the Saṁyutta are dominated by one major collection, the Great Book features several <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i> of comparable importance. For this reason, I will briefly discuss most of the substantive <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i>. I leave aside those that are merely sets of template repetitions, and also the final two <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i> on stream entry and the truths, as I have covered these topics elsewhere. I preface the discussion of the individual <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i> with a general discussion of the “qualities leading to awakening”.</p>
<p>The <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i> in the Great Book display considerable complexity in their structure and use of repetitions. But for fear of overburdening the discussion, I refer anyone interested to the relevant sections of Ven Bodhi’s <cite class="book">Connected Discourses</cite>.</p>
<h3>The 37 Qualities Leading to Awakening</h3>
<p>For the early Buddhist texts, the primary concern was the spiritual practice that leads to the escape from suffering. This is the fourth noble truth. From the very first discourse, this was spelled out by a specific set of factors comprising the path to awakening: the noble eightfold path. During his long teaching career, the Buddha presented this path in many different ways, formally or informally, briefly or in detail, emphasizing different aspects to suit the occasion or the person.</p>
<p>Before his death, it seems, the Buddha had begun to systematize these various presentations, putting together seven sets of qualities pertaining to the path, totaling 37 factors. Each set presented the path to liberation from a slightly different perspective.</p>
<p>The seven primary <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i> of the Mahāvagga contain the same teachings, albeit in a different sequence. The Mahāvagga begins with the noble eightfold path, due to its prestige and importance as <em>the</em> teaching on the path. But when presented elsewhere in the suttas we find the sets arranged numerically.</p>

<p>A cursory glance at the Pali texts shows how influential and widespread this set of 37 qualities was. It appears in each of the four <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i> (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn28">DN 28</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn29">DN 29</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn16">DN 16</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn103">MN 103</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn104">MN 104</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.81">SN 22.81</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn22.101">SN 22.101</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn43.12">SN 43.12</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an8.19">AN 8.19</a>) as well as the Udāna (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/ud5.5">Ud 5.5</a>). It is one of the few doctrinal teachings to be mentioned several times in the Vinaya (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/pj4">Pj 4</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/pc8">Pc 8</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd19">Kd 19</a>). It occurs constantly in the late canonical texts of the Khuddaka (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/ne8">Ne 8</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/cnd12">Cnd 12</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/cnd15">Cnd 15</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/cnd20">Cnd 20</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/cnd22">Cnd 22</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mnd6">Mnd 6</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mnd7">Mnd 7</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mnd14">Mnd 14</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mnd16">Mnd 16</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/ps1.5">Ps 1.5</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/ps2.8">Ps 2.8</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/ps2.9">Ps 2.9</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mil3.1.13">Mil 3.1.13</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mil6.4.1">Mil 6.4.1</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mil6.4.2">Mil 6.4.2</a>, etc.) as well as the Abhidhamma (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/vb17">Vb 17</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/Dt1.2">Dt 1.2</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/Dt2.1">Dt 2.1</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/Dt2.6">Dt 2.6</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/kv4.3">Kv 4.3</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/kv12.5">Kv 12.5</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/kv14.9">Kv 14.9</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/kv15.6">Kv 15.6</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/kv21.1">Kv 21.1</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/kv21.5">Kv 21.5</a>, etc.).</p>
<p>But its influence was not to stop there, for it remained a central doctrinal principle in later forms of Buddhism. In the Mahāyāna, for example, the same 37 qualities came to be known as the “37 practices of the Bodhisattva”.</p>
<p>The Buddha declared that these teachings emerged from his direct knowledge. They are factors of practice, to be developed and experienced by those on the spiritual journey. However, from their earliest appearances, they were also treated as teachings to be learned, memorized, and recited. From <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn29">DN 29</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should all come together and recite in concert, without disputing, those things I have taught you from my direct knowledge, comparing meaning with meaning and phrasing with phrasing, so that this spiritual path may last for a long time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such passages place the 37 factors at the heart of the Buddha’s scriptural legacy. But what, exactly, was to be recited? Surely such momentous teaching must have entailed something more than simply listing the factors. There must have been an agreed-upon body of texts, a canon of scripture recited in unity by the early community. And what could that have been if not these very teachings, the collected discourses on the factors of the path found today in the Mahāvagga? This is not to deny that expansion and elaboration of these have occurred, but the core teachings of the Mahāvagga were, in all probability, the heart of the scriptures for the earliest Buddhists.</p>
<p>Certain of the sets focus on a specific area, such as mindfulness or effort, while others have a more overall view, such as the noble eightfold path. Nevertheless, they are deeply interconnected, with the same factors recurring in multiple sets. Overall, they strongly emphasize meditation, although other dimensions of spiritual practice, such as ethics and study, are also found. Here is a brief overview of the general distinctions in perspective between the groups. Note that the first three sets loosely correspond to the final three factors of the noble eightfold path: right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Four kinds of mindfulness meditation</dt>
<dd>The practice of undertaking meditation leading to serenity and insight.</dd>
<dt>Four right efforts</dt>
<dd>The putting forth of effort in mental cultivation.</dd>
<dt>Four bases of psychic power</dt>
<dd>Development of deep immersion leading to various extraordinary abilities.</dd>
<dt>Five faculties</dt>
<dd>The mental qualities that lead to liberation, and which characterize the mind of one on the path.</dd>
<dt>Five powers</dt>
<dd>The same as the faculties.</dd>
<dt>Seven factors of awakening</dt>
<dd>Retention and investigation of teachings lead to the progressive deepening of the emotional qualities that ripen in liberation.</dd>
<dt>Noble eightfold path</dt>
<dd>The broadest in scope of the sets and the only one to explicitly mention ethics.</dd>
</dl>
<p>As is common in the suttas, these sets sometimes refer to similar qualities with different terms. The quality of wisdom, for example, is called “observation of principles” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">dhamānupassanā</i>) as the fourth kind of mindfulness meditation, “inquiry” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">vīmaṁsa</i>) in the bases for psychic power, “wisdom” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">paññā</i>) in the faculties and powers, “investigation of principles” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">dhammavicaya</i>) in the factors of awakening, and “right view” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">sammādiṭṭhi</i>) in the noble eightfold path. The relations between all these terms are analyzed in detail in the Abhidhamma and commentarial texts.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, though, that each context has its own integrity, its specific purpose and orientation, and the choice of different terms is by no means arbitrary. “Right view”, being placed at the <em>start</em> of the path, emphasizes the theoretical understanding gained by hearing the teaching. “Investigation of principles”, similarly located near the beginning, refers to the reflection and inquiry into these teachings as realized in oneself. “Observation of principles” and “inquiry” occur after the development of deep stillness in absorption meditation and refer to the inquiry and investigation into the nature of that experience, and the meditative processes and conditions that shape such profound experiences. And “wisdom”, the culmination of all these, is the realization of the four noble truths, the liberating insight of the stream-enterer. So when considered on their own, as distinct mental factors, they can be regarded as synonyms. But their true depth is realized only by understanding the role they play in their context.</p>
<p>When surveying these teachings and reflecting on them as a spiritual path, there is something rather odd about them. They appear quite different from the practices that one normally considers to be “religious”. Where are the rituals? The sacrifice? The devotion to deity? The allegiance to an institution? The symbols, rites, and mythology? These things are starkly, dramatically absent. To be sure, some such things may be found, in one form or another, elsewhere in the canon, and more so in later Buddhist traditions. But here, in the teachings regarded by the Buddha himself as his core message and practice, we find only balanced and reasoned development of behavior, emotions, and intellect. It is an integrated and rational path, one that does not depend on cultural or historical specifics, but on universal human qualities. The factors that lead to awakening, all 37 of them, are things that every human may find within themselves. In pointing to these qualities, the Buddha was pointing to the spiritual potential of all beings and offering us the means to grow and develop the best parts of ourselves.</p>
<h3>SN 45: Linked Discourses on the Path</h3>
<p>The noble eightfold path was famously declared to be the “middle way” in the Buddha’s very first teaching (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn56.11">SN 56.11</a>). It covers the entire spiritual path (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.6">SN 45.6</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.19">SN 45.19</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.20">SN 45.20</a>), beginning with the acquisition of right view as the starting point (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.1">SN 45.1</a>), and leading to deep meditative immersion as the immediate precursor to the realization of the four noble truths.</p>
<p>The noble eightfold path is said to be a “divine vehicle” which carries us to awakening, its factors compared to the parts of a chariot (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.4">SN 45.4</a>). Practicing it leads to the end of suffering (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.5">SN 45.5</a>), but only if it begins with right view, else it will lead to harming oneself (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.9">SN 45.9</a>).</p>
<p>The factors are defined at <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.8">SN 45.8</a>, as well as several other places in the canon.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Right view (<i lang="pli" translate="no">sammādiṭṭhi</i>)</dt>
<dd>Understanding the four noble truths.</dd>
<dt>Right thought (<i lang="pli" translate="no">sammāsaṅkappa</i>)</dt>
<dd>Thoughts of letting go, love, and kindness.</dd>
<dt>Right speech (<i lang="pli" translate="no">sammāvācā</i>)</dt>
<dd>Speech that is true, harmonious, gentle, and meaningful.</dd>
<dt>Right action (<i lang="pli" translate="no">sammākammanta</i>)</dt>
<dd>Avoiding killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct.</dd>
<dt>Right livelihood (<i lang="pli" translate="no">sammāājīva</i>)</dt>
<dd>Avoiding harmful livelihood.</dd>
<dt>Right effort (<i lang="pli" translate="no">sammāvāyāma</i>)</dt>
<dd>The four right efforts.</dd>
<dt>Right mindfulness (<i lang="pli" translate="no">sammāsati</i>)</dt>
<dd>The four kinds of mindfulness meditation.</dd>
<dt>Right immersion (<i lang="pli" translate="no">sammāsamādhi</i>)</dt>
<dd>The four absorptions.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The eight factors have a clear progressive aspect, as made clear from the beginning of this collection (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.1">SN 45.1</a>). They follow the same general course that is spelled out in the Gradual Training, though with less emphasis on the monastic life, as both renunciates and lay folk should practice them (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.24">SN 45.24</a>). One hears the teaching and gains an initial understanding (right view). Then one determines to live following this (right thought), undertaking the essentials of ethical conduct in speech (right speech) and body (right action), and ensuring that one does not earn money in a manner that causes harm (right livelihood). With this foundation one makes an effort to purify the mind (right effort), undertaking meditation (right mindfulness) leading to deep absorption (right immersion) (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.28">SN 45.28</a>).</p>
<p>When all these factors have been fulfilled, the mind is ready to make the breakthrough to the realization of the four noble truths. In this way the understanding of four noble truths, beginning as a concept accepted on faith, gradually deepens throughout the spiritual journey, nourished by experience and reflection. Right view guides us on each step of the path, learning from mistakes, revealing our hidden motivations, and uncovering unexpected possibilities. Ultimately it transforms into the liberating insight of the noble ones (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.13">SN 45.13</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.35">SN 45.35</a>, etc.). The key to this transformation is the brilliant clarity and stillness of meditative absorption, a higher consciousness that sees further and deeper than ever before, and which has the power to completely eradicate greed, hate, and delusion (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.36">SN 45.36</a>, etc.).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite this progression, it is not the case that the factors are to be undertaken in a literal one-at-a-time fashion. The “path” is only a metaphor, and in real life, spiritual development is more complex.</p>
<p>The factors of the path are best seen as providing a framework for reflecting on and if necessary changing one’s own life and practice. Each of these factors is essential, and if you find yourself missing out on higher factors, try asking whether you’ve put enough work into the basics. Sometimes people seem enthusiastic to get to the higher states of consciousness, without laying the broad and secure foundations offered by the simpler factors of the path. If developing deep meditation is proving difficult, then the answer is not to try to force it to ripen quicker, nor, worse, to explain it away as being somehow unnecessary. Rather, pay closer attention to improving right view through study and discussion of Dhamma; to developing right thought by becoming more generous and open-hearted; or to being more careful in one’s ethical and business conduct (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.50">SN 45.50–54</a>).</p>
<p>And remember, this path is not walked alone. For all the emphasis on solitary meditation, this <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i> reminds us that good friendship is the whole of the spiritual life (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.2">SN 45.2</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.3">SN 45.3</a>), for good friendship precedes the noble eightfold path (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.49">SN 45.49</a>).</p>
<h3>SN 46: Linked Discourses on the Awakening Factors</h3>
<p>These seven factors are called the “awakening factors” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">bojjaṅga</i>, i.e. <i lang="pli" translate="no">bodhi</i> + <i lang="pli" translate="no">aṅga</i>) because they lead to awakening (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn46.5">SN 46.5</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn46.21">SN 46.21</a>). Of themselves, they focus on the psychology of contemplation, but the <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i> makes it clear from the start that, like all presentations of the path, they rest on ethics (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn46.1">SN 46.1</a>).</p>
<p>Unlike the factors of the path, there is no explicit definition. Nevertheless, we should of course interpret these factors in the same way as they occur in the eightfold path and elsewhere. However, there are some new factors, as well as a few places that offer a new perspective on some familiar factors. Most of the following details come from <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn46.52">SN 46.52</a>.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Mindfulness (<i lang="pli" translate="no">sati</i>)</dt>
<dd>Includes both the recollection of teachings (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn46.3">SN 46.3</a>) as well as mindful awareness of phenomena internal and external.</dd>
<dt>Investigation of principles (<i lang="pli" translate="no">dhammavicaya</i>)</dt>
<dd>Includes both reflection and investigation of the teachings (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn46.3">SN 46.3</a>) as well as investigation into phenomena internal and external.</dd>
<dt>Energy (<i lang="pli" translate="no">viriya</i>)</dt>
<dd>Both mental and physical.</dd>
<dt>Rapture (<i lang="pli" translate="no">pīti</i>)</dt>
<dd>This is the experience of uplifting joy that emerges as the mind becomes peaceful in meditation. It includes the rapture of the first and second absorptions.</dd>
<dt>Tranquility (<i lang="pli" translate="no">passadhi</i>)</dt>
<dd>Both physical and mental</dd>
<dt>Immersion (<i lang="pli" translate="no">samādhi</i>)</dt>
<dd>The absorptions.</dd>
<dt>Equanimity (<i lang="pli" translate="no">upekkhā</i>)</dt>
<dd>This may be both the equanimity of the higher states of immersion as well as that of deep insight.</dd>
</dl>
<p>One detail of the preceding probably needs further explanation; that is, the idea that mindfulness includes recollection of the teachings. Mindfulness is defined throughout the suttas as the ability to recollect things that were said and done long ago (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn33">DN 33</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn34">DN 34</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn53">MN 53</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.9">SN 48.9</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.50">SN 48.50</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.35">AN 4.35</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an8.13">AN 8.13</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an10.17">AN 10.17</a>, etc.). The root meaning of the word <i lang="pli" translate="no">sati</i> is in fact “memory” and in the Brahmanical traditions it refers to the memorized scriptures. But of course today we understand mindfulness as “clear awareness” of phenomena in the present.</p>
<p>This <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i> offers a clue that helps resolve these two senses. In <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn46.56">SN 46.56</a>, a brahmin asks the Buddha why he can sometimes remember his chanting and sometimes cannot. The Buddha explains that the presence of the hindrances obscures his memory, giving an elaborate series of similes comparing water in various states with the various hindrances. How, we might wonder, does a reciter of oral texts achieve this? <em>By maintaining continued and clear focus during the act of recitation</em>. When the mind wanders and gets distracted, the recitation is lost. <i lang="pli" translate="no">Sati</i> does not mean the unstructured memories that happen to come to mind, but the steady flow and continuity of consciously focused awareness. And in this way, the act of recollecting scriptures suddenly seems a lot like keeping attention on one’s meditation.</p>
<p>The factors are sequential, with each serving as condition or fuel for the next (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn46.3">SN 46.3</a>). Multiple suttas stress this aspect of conditionality. Each of the awakening factors is nourished by a specific kind of fuel (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn46.51">SN 46.51</a>). The set as a whole emerges from the practice of the four kinds of mindfulness meditation and the series of practices that underlie them (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn45.6">SN 45.6</a>). They affect and condition the mind in distinct ways; thus when the mind is tired, it’s best to develop investigation, energy, and rapture, but when restless, develop tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. But mindfulness is always useful (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn46.53">SN 46.53</a>). And the factors themselves are the condition for awakening (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn46.56">SN 46.56</a>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even the perfected ones continue to practice them, donning any one of them whenever they wish, like a garment (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn46.4">SN 46.4</a>). Such a one has “acquired the path” and understands the true power of the awakening factors to lead to the end of rebirth (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn46.30">SN 46.30</a>).</p>
<p>The <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i> repeatedly opposes the awakening factors with their dark counterparts, the five hindrances of sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. These are compared to corruptions in gold (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn46.33">SN 46.33</a>) or to parasites (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn46.39">SN 46.39</a>).</p>
<p>A unique aspect of the awakening factors is that their recitation is said to be effective in helping cure disease. Several suttas speak of how a sick monk—and even the Buddha himself—becomes inspired by hearing them recited and rises cured (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn46.14">SN 46.14–16</a>). Understandably, this has ensured that reciting passages on the awakening factors for sick people remains popular in Theravadin culture. If such recitation seems less effective today than in the suttas, it should be borne in mind that these are cases of advanced and experienced meditators, perfected ones indeed, who had already developed these factors to completion. Their inspiration is on a different level than that of an ordinary person. And even so, there is no guarantee: there are plenty of cases in the early texts where perfected ones fall ill with no cure.</p>
<p>Most of the awakening factors refer to the emotional aspects of the spiritual path, the joy and peace of meditation. This is further emphasized in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn46.54">SN 46.54</a>, which connects the awakening factors with the four immeasurables or divine meditations—love, compassion, rejoicing, and equanimity. The Buddhist mendicants are challenged by followers of other paths, who say that they too teach the development of these things. The Buddha points out, however, that he describes <em>how</em> to develop these things to their fullest potential. And to do this the immeasurables are empowered by the awakening factors.</p>
<h3>SN 47: Linked Discourses on Mindfulness Meditation</h3>
<p>The Pali term <i lang="pli" translate="no">satipaṭṭhāna</i> means the “establishing of mindfulness”. I usually render it more colloquially as simply “mindfulness meditation”. While elsewhere <i lang="pli" translate="no">sati</i> is defined as “memory”, here it is described as <i lang="pli" translate="no">anupassanā</i>, “sustained observation”. It refers to the meditative practice of setting up and maintaining continued and unbroken awareness in four distinct arenas:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Body (<i lang="pli" translate="no">kāya</i>)</dt>
<dd>Any aspect of the physical, including the breath, the postures, parts of the body, and so on.</dd>
<dt>Feelings (<i lang="pli" translate="no">vedanā</i>)</dt>
<dd>Different kinds of feeling, whether painful, pleasurable, or neutral, spiritual or carnal.</dd>
<dt>Mind (<i lang="pli" translate="no">citta</i>)</dt>
<dd>States of awareness, whether under the influence of greed, hate, and delusion, or free of such.</dd>
<dt>Principles (<i lang="pli" translate="no">dhammā</i>)</dt>
<dd>Understanding the causal relations that lead to suffering or to peace, especially by reflecting on the process of meditation itself.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Each of these can include a diverse range of experience. But in meditation, it is important to keep focus. The standard formula phrases this through the use of the reflexive idiom <i lang="pli" translate="no">kāye kāyānupassī</i>. Here the locative case is used quite literally to mean “one of the bodies in the body”, or as we would say in English, a particular aspect of the body. Thus the meditator does not continually shift attention to whatever comes into mind but maintains a steady, continuous awareness of a specific aspect of physical experience.</p>
<p>This is a progressive practice. The nature of this progress becomes more clear when it is recognized that mindfulness of breathing is a form of <i lang="pli" translate="no">satipaṭṭhāna</i> practice.</p>
<ol>
<li>Meditation begins with attention to the relatively coarse phenomena of the physical breath until it becomes calm and still.</li>
<li>A subtle sense of joy and bliss pervades the breath and the body.</li>
<li>The mind becomes free, immersed in the singular experience of the bliss of release.</li>
<li>One contemplates the changing process of meditation that has led to this point. The mind, empowered by immersion, lets go.</li>
</ol>
<p>But <i lang="pli" translate="no">satipaṭṭhāna</i> is broader than I have indicated here, for it includes not only the positive experiences that evolve during meditation but also the negative ones: the pain, the constricted mind, the hindrances. By encompassing the full range of experience, <i lang="pli" translate="no">satipaṭṭhāna</i> promotes a broad, inclusive approach to meditation, one based on awareness rather than control, laying the groundwork for the flowering of wisdom.</p>
<p>This <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i> presents a series of insightful and often delightful suttas on <i lang="pli" translate="no">satipaṭṭhāna</i>, but it does not define the scope of the meditation. The definitions above are derived from the longer discourses today found at <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn10">MN 10</a> and <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn22">DN 22</a>. However, these have undergone considerable late development as compared with the short discourses of the <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i>, and one cannot simply assume that everything in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn10">MN 10</a> and <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn22">DN 22</a> applies in the <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i>.</p>
<p>The Pali compound <i lang="pli" translate="no">satipaṭṭhāna</i> resolves to <i lang="pli" translate="no">sati</i> + <i lang="pli" translate="no">upaṭṭhāna</i>. This phrase is familiar from the Gradual Training, where it refers to the moment when a practitioner sits down in seclusion and begins meditation by “establishing mindfulness” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">satiṁ upaṭṭhapetvā</i>). It thus refers primarily to the formal practice of meditation.</p>
<p>Today it is common to speak of “mindfulness in daily life”, but in the suttas, this is called <i lang="pli" translate="no">sampajañña</i>, which I translate as “situational awareness”. This is one of the series of practices in the Gradual Training that lays the groundwork for formal meditation. <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn47.2">SN 47.2</a> makes plain the distinction between these two by treating them as two qualities the mendicant should develop. This is not to say, of course, that they are completely separate, for nothing in spiritual and mental development happens in isolation. <i lang="pli" translate="no">Sampajañña</i> is not limited to “mindfulness in daily life”, but plays a role in absorptions and insight as well (see <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn47.35">SN 47.35</a>). But it is to say that these two practices are primarily distinct, with situational awareness helping to prepare the mind for mindfulness meditation.</p>
<p>The standard formula describes the mindful meditator with four terms. These refer back to the fundamental helper practices of the Gradual Training, reminding us that <i lang="pli" translate="no">satipaṭṭhāna</i> meditation does not happen in isolation:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Keen (<i lang="pli" translate="no">ātāpī</i>)</dt>
<dd>possessing persistent and unflagging energy.</dd>
<dt>Aware (<i lang="pli" translate="no">sampajāno</i>)</dt>
<dd>possessing situational awareness.</dd>
<dt>Mindful (<i lang="pli" translate="no">satimā</i>)</dt>
<dd>possessing mindfulness.</dd>
<dt>Rid of desire and aversion for the world (<i lang="pli" translate="no">vineyya loke abhijjhādomanassaṁ</i>)</dt>
<dd>having eliminated the overt forms of desire and aversion through the practice of sense restraint. The phrase <i lang="pli" translate="no">abhijjhādomanassa</i> is elsewhere used only in the context of sense restraint (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn10">DN 10</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn33">MN 33</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn35.120">SN 35.120</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.14">AN 4.14</a>, etc.).</dd>
</dl>
<p>In the eightfold path, the awakening factors, the faculties, and the powers, mindfulness meditation is one of the key factors leading to deep meditative stillness and immersion. It is defined elsewhere as “the basis for immersion in <i lang="pli" translate="no">samādhi</i>” (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn44">MN 44</a>: <i lang="pli" translate="no">cattāro satipaṭṭhānā samādhinimittā</i>). With the charming parable of a cook, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn47.8">SN 47.8</a> shows how a skillful mindfulness meditator, by understanding the characteristics of their mind, enters immersion and abandons defilements, while a poor meditator fails. In <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn47.4">SN 47.4</a> the Buddha urges all meditators, whether beginners or advanced, to practice mindfulness to the level of full immersion (<i lang="pli" translate="no">ekodibhūtā vippasannacittā samāhitā ekaggacittā</i>; “at one, with minds that are clear, immersed in <i lang="pli" translate="no">samādhi</i>, and unified”).</p>
<p>The centrality of meditative immersion is reinforced by the saying that <i lang="pli" translate="no">satipaṭṭhāna</i> is the “path to convergence” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">ekāyano maggo</i>). This saying is famous from <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn10">MN 10</a> but sourced from the Saṁyutta, where the saying is placed in the mouth of Brahmā (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn47.1">SN 47.1</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn47.18">SN 47.18</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn47.43">SN 47.43</a>). It is a term from the Upaniṣads, which in contemplative contexts means “the place where all things come together as one” (Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad 2.4:11).</p>
<p>The meditative absorptions (<i lang="pli" translate="no">jhānas</i>) are explicitly brought into <i lang="pli" translate="no">satipaṭṭhāna</i> in the extended and late passage on the four noble truths in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn22">DN 22</a>. However they are implicit in many places, including the observation of feelings under the notions of “spiritual rapture” and “spiritual bliss”, which are defined in terms of the absorptions (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn36.31">SN 36.31</a>); as well as in the observation of mind under the mind that is “expansive”, “unexcelled”, “immersed”, “freed”, all of which are terms for deep states of absorption; or the discussion at <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn125">MN 125</a>.</p>
<p>This is not to say that insight (or discernment, <i lang="pli" translate="no">vipassanā</i>) has no place in <i lang="pli" translate="no">satipaṭṭhāna</i>. On the contrary, the fourth of the <i lang="pli" translate="no">satipaṭṭhānas</i>, the observation of principles, is primarily concerned with the insight that follows from meditative immersion. Here, as described in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn10">MN 10</a>, one does not merely observe the presence and absence of various factors, one understands the reason why they appear and disappear. And understanding causality is the heart of insight. This is reinforced in the teaching on mindfulness of breathing, which introduces the contemplation of impermanence at this point.</p>
<p>Two suttas bring the <i lang="pli" translate="no">vipassanā</i> aspect to the fore. In <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn47.40">SN 47.40</a>, the Buddha first teaches the standard <i lang="pli" translate="no">satipaṭṭhāna</i> practice, then introduces the “development” of <i lang="pli" translate="no">satipaṭṭhāna</i>. In the suttas, “development” means the enhancement and expansion of what is already there. (<i lang="pli" translate="no">Bhāvanā</i> is derived from the causative form of the word “to be”, i.e. “to make be more”.) This further development involves contemplating all four of the <i lang="pli" translate="no">satipaṭṭhānas</i> in terms of origin and cessation. The exact meaning of this is spelled out in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn47.42">SN 47.42</a>, which gives the origin of each of the four.</p>
<p>A distinctive feature of this collection is the number of charming parables, which are as memorable as they are amusing. In addition to the story of the cook which we mentioned above (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn47.8">SN 47.8</a>), we hear how a quail learned to escape a hawk (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn47.6">SN 47.6</a>), how a foolish monkey got trapped in tar (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn47.7">SN 47.7</a>), and how two acrobats support each other (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn47.19">SN 47.19</a>). Another discourse sets a seemingly impossible challenge for mindfulness practice: to walk, carrying a bowl of oil filled to the brim, between a popular performer and the crowd jostling to see her, while a man with a drawn sword waits to chop off your head if you spill a drop (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn47.20">SN 47.20</a>)!</p>
<h3>SN 48: Linked Discourses on the Faculties</h3>
<p>The word <i lang="pli" translate="no">indriya</i> has a rather interesting history. It occurs 39 times in the Ṛg Veda in the general sense of “the power of Indra”, the great warrior-god and dragon-slayer known in Pali as Sakka. But the nature of this power is perhaps not what one might imagine, for more than two-thirds of these cases connect <i lang="pli" translate="no">indriya</i> with <i lang="pli" translate="no">soma</i>.</p>
<p>Now, <i lang="pli" translate="no">soma</i> was of course a drug, probably a preparation from the amphetamine-like stimulant ephedra. It was drunk by the ancient Indo-Europeans to imbue warriors with berserk energy on the battlefield. As well as taming the horse and inventing the fast two-wheeled chariot, drug-enhanced combat was one of the key innovations underlying the military success of the Indo-Europeans.</p>
<p>In the Vedic culture this was ritualized as religious practice: Indra himself drinks <i lang="pli" translate="no">soma</i> to magnify his potency. He becomes unstoppable and crushes all his enemies before him. His devotees follow his example, manifesting the power of the god within themselves. The drug-induced high gave them the might of the gods. But the crucial point is that the power is not borrowed from Indra; rather, both god and devotee draw power from the same source. It was inside them all along, it just needed the <i lang="pli" translate="no">soma</i> to bring it out.</p>
<p>By the time of the Buddha, the Vedic age was long-gone and the <i lang="pli" translate="no">soma</i> was largely forgotten. Later commentators, unfamiliar with its Vedic roots, defined <i lang="pli" translate="no">indriya</i> as “rulership”, and the various <i lang="pli" translate="no">indriyas</i> in Buddhism as the governing faculties that exercise control over their domains. But the use in the suttas shows that the meaning lies closer to the Vedic sense of “potency”. The <i lang="pli" translate="no">indriyas</i> are innate potentials that can be manifested in the right conditions.</p>
<p>This is why, after the Buddha’s awakening, he surveyed the world and assessed the <i lang="pli" translate="no">indriyas</i> of the many different beings in it. He saw the spiritual potential latent within each person to different degrees, and realized that this hidden potential could be drawn out with the right teaching and encouragement (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn6.1">SN 6.1</a>).</p>
<p>To formulate a teaching on the <i lang="pli" translate="no">indriyas</i>, the Buddha drew upon a set of five qualities he had developed under his former teachers Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn26/en/sujato#17">MN 26:17</a>, etc.). That these are a set of teachings in the Brahmanical tradition is confirmed by their mention in the Yogasūtra (1.20). He called this set the five <i lang="pli" translate="no">indriyas</i>.</p>
<p>The same qualities were also known as the <i lang="pli" translate="no">balas</i> or “powers”. At <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.43">SN 48.43</a> the Buddha discusses the relation between these two sets, saying they are like a river that flows around an island. They are part of the same stream and go to the same place, but from a certain perspective, they can be distinguished. The term <i lang="pli" translate="no">bala</i>, like <i lang="pli" translate="no">indriya</i>, is Vedic, with the same basic sense of potency or strength, and occurs in contexts featuring Indra and his <i lang="pli" translate="no">soma</i>. The <i lang="pli" translate="no">balas</i> have only some repetition templates in the <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i>, and are defined in the Aṅguttara (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an5.14">AN 5.14</a>).</p>
<p>The <i lang="pli" translate="no">indriyas</i> (together with the <i lang="pli" translate="no">balas</i>) came to be included in the 37 <i lang="pli" translate="no">bodhipakkhiyadhammā</i>, and form the heart of the Indriya Saṁyutta, where they are defined as follows (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.8">SN 48.8</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.9">SN 48.9</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.10">SN 48.10</a>):</p>
<dl>

<dd>Faith in the Buddha’s awakening.</dd>
<dt>Energy (<i lang="pli" translate="no">viriya</i>)</dt>

<dt>Wisdom (<i lang="pli" translate="no">paññā</i>)</dt>
<dd>Understanding impermanence and the four noble truths.</dd>
</dl>
<p>By beginning with faith (<i lang="pli" translate="no">saddhā</i>), the text introduces a quality not explicitly mentioned in the earlier sets. In Buddhism, faith is essential. In traditional Buddhist lands to this day, the quiet yet steadfast faith and devotion to the Buddha and his teachings is ever-present, expressed through offerings of flowers, through grace and humility in the presence of the sacred, or uplifting recollection of the Buddha’s words. It is an emotional quality, often paired with <i lang="pli" translate="no">pema</i>, “affection”. But the Buddha explicitly rejected blind or “baseless faith” (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn95/en/sujato#13">MN 95:13</a>: <i lang="pli" translate="no">amūlikā saddhā</i>) and urged his followers to develop a “grounded faith” (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn47/en/sujato#16">MN 47:16</a>: <i lang="pli" translate="no">ākāravatī saddhā</i>) based on careful and critical inquiry.</p>
<p>This is a faith that is akin to the confidence and trust that a scientist needs when relying on the findings and theories of others in their field. It is essential in order to get anywhere; but at the same time, it is completely provisional. If there is anything that is contradicted by the evidence, it should be rejected. And once you have seen the truth for yourself, there is no need for faith, as pointed out by Venerable Sāriputta in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.44">SN 48.44</a>.</p>
<p>Following the pattern we have seen in previous sets of qualities, the mention of faith aligns the faculties with the progress of one following the Gradual Training. First, one hears the teaching and gains faith, then one goes forth and applies energy in practice, undertaking mindfulness meditation, realizing the absorptions and the wisdom into impermanence that follows on from them. At this point, a practitioner goes beyond simple belief or reasoned argument and sees the truth for themselves. Their faith is described as <i lang="pli" translate="no">aveccappasāda</i>, “experiential” or “confirmed” confidence. The word <i lang="pli" translate="no">avecca</i> literally means “having undergone”. It is only at this point that faith is unshakable.</p>
<p>Many suttas on the five faculties are built along the same kinds of patterns and templates as the <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i> on the noble eightfold path or the awakening factors. But in two related respects they are quite distinctive. And both of these distinctive features stem from the root sense of <i lang="pli" translate="no">indriya</i> as “potency” or “potential”.</p>
<p>The first of these two features is the use of the faculties to grade practitioners. One who truly understands the faculties is a stream-enterer (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.2">SN 48.2</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.3">SN 48.3</a>), while one who, based on this understanding, completely lets go is a perfected one (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.4">SN 48.4</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.5">SN 48.5</a>). This grading of practitioners based on their development of the faculties is extended in more detail in a further series of discourses (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.12">SN 48.12–18</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.24">SN 48.24</a>).</p>
<p>So while, in one sense, we all have these faculties within us as a hidden potential, they do not manifest their strength until empowered by the path. Once that happens, at the moment of stream-entry, they are as unstoppable as Indra on a dragon-slaying rampage.</p>
<p>To understand the second distinctive feature, recall that in these <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i> we are dealing with the path, the fourth of the noble truths, which is “to be developed” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">bhāvetabba</i>). And while the Indriya Saṁyutta, like other <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyuttas</i> on the path, does indeed speak of the “development of the faculties”, a series of suttas also speaks of understanding the faculties in light of the four noble truths (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.2">SN 48.2–7</a>). Normally such phrasing is found in discourses dealing with the first noble truth, such as those on the aggregates or sense fields, which are “to be fully understood”. Here the texts are blurring the distinction between the first and fourth noble truths. To be sure, this is not unique; we have already noted that a couple of discourses on <i lang="pli" translate="no">satipaṭṭhāna</i> do a similar thing differently. But it is unusual, and certainly the emphasis is unique.</p>
<p>There is nothing doctrinally difficult about this; after all, the path is conditioned (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.34">AN 4.34</a>), and all conditioned things are suffering. But the Buddha usually spoke of the path in glowingly positive terms, not about its suffering and drawbacks.</p>
<p>Once again, this makes sense when we consider the faculties as inner potentials, as something that we already possess in a latent form to one degree or another. In understanding the faculties we are understanding <em>who we are</em> and <em>who we might become</em>.</p>
<p>This idea that an <i lang="pli" translate="no">indriya</i> is a potency or ability or strength possessed by a person is further developed in the remainder of the <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i>, which introduces a series of faculties beyond the basic five. Together with the five faculties, these make up a list of 22 faculties, which became a standard set in the Abhidhamma (see <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/vb5">Vb 5</a>). Here they are in the Abhidhamma sequence:</p>
<ul>
<li>The six sense faculties (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.25">SN 48.25</a>).</li>
<li>Three biological faculties: femininity, masculinity, and vitality (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.22">SN 48.22</a>).</li>
<li>Five kinds of feeling as faculties (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.31">SN 48.31</a>).</li>
<li>The five spiritual faculties.</li>
<li>Three faculties relating to stages of awakening (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn48.23">SN 48.23</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Senses, feelings, and even biological attributes, are things that everyone possesses. They must be understood as part of conditioned reality, and hence suffering, but they can be harnessed to empower the spiritual path.</p>
<h3>SN 51: Linked Discourses on the Bases for Psychic Power</h3>
<p>We have learned that the terms <i lang="pli" translate="no">indriya</i> and <i lang="pli" translate="no">bala</i>, which we translate as “faculty” and “power” were Vedic terms closely associated with the divine might of the war-god Indra. The current <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i> deals with <i lang="pli" translate="no">iddhi</i>, another Vedic term with a similar meaning of “success, power, potency”. Note that the Pali <i lang="pli" translate="no">iddhi</i> is identical in meaning with two Vedic terms, <i lang="pli" translate="no">siddhi</i> and <i lang="pli" translate="no">ṛddhi</i>, but formally it is derived from the latter. <i lang="pli" translate="no">Pāda</i> literally means “foot”, and since <i lang="pli" translate="no">iddhipāda</i> is defined as the “path or practice to gaining <i lang="pli" translate="no">iddhi</i>” (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn51.27">SN 51.27</a>), it’s tempting to maintain the metaphor by speaking of the “four footsteps to psychic power”.</p>
<p><i lang="pli" translate="no">Iddhis</i> may refer to various kinds of success, potency, or power, but in this context, they consist of various astonishing feats of psychic power or superpowers. Such feats have a long and colorful history in India. In the Vedas, as we have seen, they originated in the legendary military prowess of the gods, to which mortals aspired with the aid of stimulants. As the <i lang="pli" translate="no">soma</i> vanished, it seems, other means of transcending normal human and physical limits were sought. Ascetics undertook punishing mortifications (<i lang="pli" translate="no">tapas</i>), torturing their bodies in search of superpowers. While some pre-Buddhist religious practitioners—notably those of the Jains and the Upaniṣads—had set themselves more lofty and worthy goals than mere powers, there remained many for whom spiritual practice was a means to these decidedly worldly ends.</p>
<p>The modern cultural fascination with superheroes shows that this is not bound to a specific cultural time or place. It is about the very human longing for transcendence and transformation, becoming other, becoming more. Superheroes display many of the same kinds of powers talked about in the Buddhist and other ancient Indian texts: mind-reading, enhanced senses, the ability to control the elements or to multiply one’s form, to fly in the sky and even through space (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn51.11">SN 51.11</a>). And the means by which powers are gained remain similar to the pre-Buddhist traditions: they may be of divine or alien origin; or derived from a drug or chemical agent; or the outcome of enduring trials and suffering.</p>
<p>Dispensing with these methods, however, the Buddha said that superpowers are gained through pure mental development or meditation. The focus shifted from the powers themselves to the means for attaining them; which, it turns out, also happens to be the path to awakening. The various powers extend or enhance ordinary human abilities, and they may be developed in the same way as any other ability is developed: by practice.</p>
<p>Despite their frequent mention in Buddhist texts, psychic powers are notably omitted when it comes to the really important things. They are side-effects of the spiritual path, things that may be fun and of some worth as preliminary exercises, but far from the true goal (see <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn12.70">SN 12.70</a>). The Buddha had a decidedly ambiguous attitude to powers, especially when they were shown off. He forbade the monastics from displaying them publicly, saying monks who make such displays were like a woman who shows her private parts for a cheap coin (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15#8.2">Kd 15:8.2</a>). Displays of psychic powers are moreover criticized because they seem like mere magic (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn11/en/sujato#5">DN 11:5</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.60">AN 3.60</a>). And the possession of superpowers was by no means a sign of genuine spiritual attainment, for even Devadatta, the Buddha’s arch-nemesis, was said to have attained them (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd17#1.4">Kd 17:1.4</a>).</p>
<p>None of this addresses the question of whether such powers are real. The suttas assume throughout that they are, and there is no reason to think this does not reflect the Buddha’s views. Traditional Buddhism has always accepted the reality of experiences and powers beyond the normal, and Buddhist cultures are full of anecdotes and stories about such events. Rigorous studies, however, are harder to come by. The extraordinary <cite class="book">Irreducible Mind</cite>, a sustained critique of reductionist theories of mind, assembles hundreds of studies into various kinds of extraordinary phenomena. While a reasonable person may well remain skeptical, it seems there is a significant body of evidence in support of such things as mind-reading or recollection of past lives. The ability to fly or to touch the sun remain, sadly, unattested.</p>
<p>Normally in the suttas the term <i lang="pli" translate="no">iddhi</i> is used for a specific set of psychic powers, which primarily exhibit mastery over the physical realm (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn51.19">SN 51.19</a>, etc.). These are typically included within a broader set of six “direct knowledges” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">abhiññā</i>), which are also mentioned in this <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṁyutta</i> (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn51.11">SN 51.11</a>). The final one of these is the ending of defilements and rebirth, the true goal of Buddhist practice.</p>
<p>As to the substance of the <i lang="pli" translate="no">iddhipādas</i>, there are four basic terms:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Enthusiasm (<i lang="pli" translate="no">chanda</i>)</dt>
<dd>This is one of the most common words for “desire”. While not formally mentioned as an item in the other lists of the <i lang="pli" translate="no">bodhipakkhiyadhammā</i>, it appears in the formula for the four right efforts. It is the desire to do good, to practice, to escape suffering.</dd>
<dt>Energy (<i lang="pli" translate="no">viriya</i>)</dt>
<dd>This is the single most common factor among the 37 <i lang="pli" translate="no">bodhipakkhiyadhammā</i>. However, in the bases for psychic power it receives special emphasis as it is not only one of the factors, but also qualifies each of the factors.</dd>
<dt>Mind (<i lang="pli" translate="no">citta</i>)</dt>
<dd>Thought, idea, resolve, or awareness (see below).</dd>
<dt>Inquiry (<i lang="pli" translate="no">vīmaṁsā</i>)</dt>
<dd>Inquiry or investigation into the Dhamma, but especially into what obstructs meditation and what helps it. In this context, it is not too far in meaning from “curiosity”.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Curiously enough, though the word <i lang="pli" translate="no">citta</i> has a wide range of meanings, it is not clearly defined in this context. Even the Abhidhamma and commentaries offer little more than the usual list of synonyms for “mind” (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/vb9">Vb 9</a>). Normally in the context of the path, the mind is “to be developed” (see <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn51.9">SN 51.9</a>) and such “development of mind” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">cittabhāvanā</i>) is a term for <i lang="pli" translate="no">samādhi</i> and the path to it. Accordingly, <i lang="pli" translate="no">citta</i> falls between the energy and wisdom factors, in the place normally occupied by <i lang="pli" translate="no">samādhi</i> and mindfulness, and is said to be developed in the normal way of <i lang="pli" translate="no">samādhi</i> (see <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn51.11">SN 51.11</a>). And <i lang="pli" translate="no">samādhi</i> itself, like energy, is constantly emphasized as essential to this practice at every point.</p>
<p>However, <i lang="pli" translate="no">citta</i> is also the thought or intention that gets you to your destination (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn51.15">SN 51.15</a>). In line with this, one gains <i lang="pli" translate="no">samādhi</i> by relying on <i lang="pli" translate="no">citta</i> (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn51.13">SN 51.13</a>), which suggests that <i lang="pli" translate="no">citta</i> cannot be exactly identical with <i lang="pli" translate="no">samādhi</i>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the term <i lang="pli" translate="no">citta</i> was used here precisely because of its breadth of meaning. It encompasses the “thought” of the Dhamma, of practice, or of the goal; the “idea” one has in mind that leads one on; the “resolve” that keeps attention focused; the growing “awareness” as the goal comes into view; and the purified “consciousness” of deep meditation. In this way <i lang="pli" translate="no">citta</i> here covers the same ground as it does as one of the four <i lang="pli" translate="no">satipaṭṭhānas</i>: it refers to the mental state with which one develops the path, including, but not limited to, states of <i lang="pli" translate="no">samādhi</i>.</p>
<p>The four bases are almost always presented in a stock formula that consists of a long compound, the meaning of which is explained at <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn51.13">SN 51.13</a>. Each of the four qualities may be relied on to develop deep unification of mind, or <i lang="pli" translate="no">samādhi</i>. This process involves making an active effort, defined in terms of the four right efforts. Thus each of the <i lang="pli" translate="no">iddhipādas</i> consists of these three aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>One of the four qualities.</li>
<li>The meditative immersion that results.</li>
<li>The effort required.</li>
</ol>
<p>At <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn51.20">SN 51.20</a> we find the most detailed explanation of how these are applied in practice. This sutta brings in several practices familiar from elsewhere in the suttas, such as the contemplation of the 31 parts of the body. While most of these are straightforward, there is a somewhat obscure Pali idiom that begs a little clarification. That is the phrase “as before, so after; as after, so before” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">yathā pure tathā pacchā, yathā pacchā tathā pure</i>), called the “perception of continuity” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">pacchāpuresaññā</i>). Similar phrases are found in several places in the context of meditation (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/thag6.4">Thag 6.4</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn47.10">SN 47.10</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an7.61">AN 7.61</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.90">AN 3.90</a>). In the Vinaya, the same phrase is used to emphasize that the status of a mendicant remains unchanged. In meditation, it points to the need for constant and consistent effort in maintaining one’s focus. As part of a series of related idioms—as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as this is, so is that—it indicates how the process of meditation moves from diversity and differentiation towards unity and oneness.</p>
<p>When first encountering the bases for psychic power, students are often puzzled by an apparent paradox. Desire, so we’re told, is the cause of suffering, yet here we are supposed to develop it. This problem is addressed directly in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/sn51.15">SN 51.15</a>, where Ānanda explains to the brahmin Uṇṇābha that the spiritual path is lived to give up desire, which is accomplished by developing the four bases of psychic power. But Uṇṇābha protests, for desire is itself one of the four bases, and desire cannot be given up using desire. Ānanda resolves the contradiction with the simile of a man walking to a park. Before setting out, one has the desire, the energy, the idea, or the curiosity to reach the park. But when you get there, those things vanish. In the same way, the desire or enthusiasm to reach the goal of spiritual practice carries you to the goal, but once there it is no longer needed.</p>
<h2 id="intro-item7">A Brief Textual History</h2>
<p>The Saṁyutta Nikāya was edited by M. Léon Feer on the basis of manuscripts in Sinhalese and Burmese scripts and published in Latin script by the Pali Text Society from 1884 to 1898. The first translation followed in 1917–30 by Mrs. C.A.F. Rhys Davids (vols. 1–2) and F.L. Woodward (vols. 3–5) under the title <cite class="book">The Book of the Kindred Sayings</cite>. In 1999 the PTS issued a new edition of the Pali text of vol. 1 Sagāthāvagga, edited by G.A. Somaratne.</p>
<p>While several partial translations were subsequently made, there was no complete new translation in English until 2002, when Bhikkhu Bodhi published his <cite class="book">The Connected Discourses of the Buddha</cite>. As with his translation of the <cite class="book">The Middle-Length Discourses of the Buddha</cite>, this constituted a major leap forward, essentially rendering the earlier translations obsolete. Unlike the <cite class="book">Middle-Length Discourses</cite>, this was an entirely new translation. In an extensive introduction, Bhikkhu Bodhi spelled out his evolving approach to translation and presented a detailed thematic and structural analysis of the text.</p>
<p>Where the Pali was unclear I frequently referred to the earlier work of Bodhi, and rarely to Woodward/Rhys Davids and various translations of specific texts.</p>

<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
<p>I remember with gratitude all those from whom I have learned the Dhamma, especially Ajahn Brahm and Bhikkhu Bodhi, the two monks who more than anyone else showed me the depth, meaning, and practical value of the Suttas.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Dustin and Keiko Cheah and family, who sponsored my stay in Qi Mei while I made this translation.</p>
<p>Thanks also for Blake Walshe, who provided essential software support for my translation work.</p>
<p>Throughout the process of translation, I have frequently sought feedback and suggestions from the SuttaCentral community on our forum, “Discuss and Discover”. I want to thank all those who have made suggestions and contributed to my understanding, as well as to the moderators who have made the forum possible. These translations were significantly improved due to the careful work of my proofreaders: Ayyā Pāsādā, John and Lynn Kelly, and Derek Sola. Special thanks are due to Sabbamittā, a true friend of all, who has tirelessly and precisely checked my work.</p>
<p>Finally my everlasting thanks to all those people, far too many to mention, who have supported SuttaCentral, and those who have supported my life as a monastic. None of this would be possible without you.</p>

<p id="sn56.41:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: </p>
<p id="sn56.41:1.3">“Once upon a time, mendicants, a certain person left Rājagaha, thinking ‘I’ll speculate about the world.’ They went to the Sumāgadhā lotus pond and sat down on the bank speculating about the world. Then that person saw an army of four divisions enter a lotus stalk. When he saw this he thought, ‘I’ve gone mad, really, I’ve lost my mind! I’m seeing things that don’t exist in the world.’ </p>
<p id="sn56.41:2.1">Then that person entered the city and informed a large crowd, ‘I’ve gone mad, really, I’ve lost my mind! I’m seeing things that don’t exist in the world.’ </p>
<p id="sn56.41:2.4">‘But how is it that you’re mad? How have you lost your mind? And what have you seen that doesn’t exist in the world?’ </p>
<p id="sn56.41:2.6">‘Sirs, I left Rājagaha, thinking “I’ll speculate about the world.” I went to the Sumāgadhā lotus pond and sat down on the bank speculating about the world. Then I saw an army of four divisions enter a lotus stalk. That’s why I’m mad, that’s why I’ve lost my mind. And that’s what I’ve seen that doesn’t exist in the world.’ </p>
<p id="sn56.41:2.10">‘Well, mister, you’re definitely mad, you’ve definitely lost your mind. And you’re seeing things that don’t exist in the world.’ </p>
<p id="sn56.41:3.1">But what that person saw was in fact real, not unreal. Once upon a time, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons. In that battle the gods won and the demons lost. The defeated and terrified demons entered the citadel of the demons through the lotus stalk only to confuse the gods. </p>
<p id="sn56.41:4.1">So mendicants, don’t speculate about the world. For example: the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist. Why is that? Because those thoughts aren’t beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. </p>
<p id="sn56.41:5.1">When you think something up, you should think: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.

<p id="sn56.11:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana. There the Buddha addressed the group of five mendicants: </p>
<p id="sn56.11:2.1">“Mendicants, these two extremes should not be cultivated by one who has gone forth. What two? Indulgence in sensual pleasures, which is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And indulgence in self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless. Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One woke up by understanding the middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment. </p>
<p id="sn56.11:3.1">And what is that middle way of practice? It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. This is that middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment. </p>
<p id="sn56.11:4.1">Now this is the noble truth of suffering. Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; illness is suffering; death is suffering; association with the disliked is suffering; separation from the liked is suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering. </p>
<p id="sn56.11:4.3">Now this is the noble truth of the origin of suffering. It’s the craving that leads to future lives, mixed up with relishing and greed, chasing pleasure in various realms. That is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving to continue existence, and craving to end existence. </p>
<p id="sn56.11:4.6">Now this is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering. It’s the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over; giving it away, letting it go, releasing it, and not adhering to it. </p>
<p id="sn56.11:4.8">Now this is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. </p>
<p id="sn56.11:5.1">‘This is the noble truth of suffering.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another. ‘This noble truth of suffering should be completely understood.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … ‘This noble truth of suffering has been completely understood.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … </p>
<p id="sn56.11:6.1">‘This is the noble truth of the origin of suffering.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … ‘This noble truth of the origin of suffering should be given up.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … ‘This noble truth of the origin of suffering has been given up.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … </p>
<p id="sn56.11:7.1">‘This is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … ‘This noble truth of the cessation of suffering should be realized.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … ‘This noble truth of the cessation of suffering has been realized.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … </p>
<p id="sn56.11:8.1">‘This is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … ‘This noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering should be developed.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … ‘This noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering has been developed.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another. </p>
<p id="sn56.11:9.1">As long as my true knowledge and vision about these four noble truths was not fully purified in these three perspectives and twelve aspects, I didn’t announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. </p>
<p id="sn56.11:10.1">But when my true knowledge and vision about these four noble truths was fully purified in these three perspectives and twelve aspects, I announced my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. </p>
<p id="sn56.11:10.2">Knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘My freedom is unshakable; this is my last rebirth; now there’ll be no more future lives.’” </p>
<p id="sn56.11:10.4">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the group of five mendicants was happy with what the Buddha said. </p>
<p id="sn56.11:11.1">And while this discourse was being spoken, the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in Venerable Koṇḍañña: “Everything that has a beginning has an end.” </p>
<p id="sn56.11:12.1">And when the Buddha rolled forth the Wheel of Dhamma, the earth gods raised the cry: “Near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.” </p>
<p id="sn56.11:12.3">Hearing the cry of the Earth Gods, the Gods of the Four Great Kings … the Gods of the Thirty-Three … the Gods of Yama … the Joyful Gods … the Gods Who Love to Create … the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others … the Gods of Brahmā’s Host raised the cry: “Near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.” </p>
<p id="sn56.11:13.1">And so at that moment, in that instant, the cry soared up to the Brahmā realm. And this galaxy shook and rocked and trembled. And an immeasurable, magnificent light appeared in the world, surpassing the glory of the gods. </p>
<p id="sn56.11:14.1">Then the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: “Koṇḍañña has really understood! Koṇḍañña has really understood!” </p>
<p id="sn56.11:14.3">And that’s how Venerable Koṇḍañña came to be known as “Koṇḍañña Who Understood”. </p>

<p id="sn56.10:1.1">“Mendicants, don’t engage in all kinds of low talk, such as talk about kings, bandits, and ministers; talk about armies, threats, and wars; talk about food, drink, clothes, and beds; talk about garlands and fragrances; talk about family, vehicles, villages, towns, cities, and countries; talk about women and heroes; street talk and talk at the well; talk about the departed; motley talk; tales of land and sea; and talk about being reborn in this or that state of existence. Why is that? Because those discussions aren’t beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life.

What, you understand this teaching and training? You’re practicing wrong. I’m practicing right. I stay on topic, you don’t. You said last what you should have said first.

<p id="sn55.54:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. </p>
<p id="sn55.54:1.2">At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering. </p>
<p id="sn55.54:1.4">Mahānāma the Sakyan heard about this. Then he went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him that he had heard that the Buddha was leaving. He added, “Sir, I haven’t heard and learned it in the presence of the Buddha how a wise lay follower should advise another wise lay follower who is sick, suffering, gravely ill.” </p>
<p id="sn55.54:2.1">“Mahānāma, a wise lay follower should put at ease another wise lay follower who is sick, suffering, gravely ill with four consolations. ‘Be at ease, sir. You have experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … And you have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.’ </p>
<p id="sn55.54:3.1">When a wise lay follower has put at ease another wise lay follower who is sick, suffering, gravely ill with these four consolations, they should say: ‘Are you concerned for your mother and father?’ If they reply, ‘I am,’ they should say: ‘But sir, it’s your nature to die. Whether or not you are concerned for your mother and father, you will die anyway. It would be good to give up concern for your mother and father.’ </p>
<p id="sn55.54:4.1">If they reply, ‘I have given up concern for my mother and father,’ they should say: ‘But are you concerned for your partners and children?’ If they reply, ‘I am,’ they should say: ‘But sir, it’s your nature to die. Whether or not you are concerned for your partners and children, you will die anyway. It would be good to give up concern for your partners and children.’ </p>
<p id="sn55.54:5.1">If they reply, ‘I have given up concern for my partners and children,’ they should say: ‘But are you concerned for the five kinds of human sensual stimulation?’ If they reply, ‘I am,’ they should say: ‘Good sir, heavenly sensual pleasures are better than human sensual pleasures. It would be good to turn your mind away from human sensual pleasures and fix it on the gods of the Four Great Kings.’ </p>
<p id="sn55.54:6.1">If they reply, ‘I have done so,’ they should say: ‘Good sir, the gods of the Thirty-Three are better than the gods of the Four Great Kings … </p>
<p id="sn55.54:7.1">Good sir, the gods of Yama … the Joyful Gods … the Gods Who Love to Create … the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others … the Gods of the Brahmā realm are better than the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others. It would be good to turn your mind away from the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others and fix it on the Gods of the Brahmā realm.’ If they reply, ‘I have done so,’ they should say: ‘Good sir, the Brahmā realm is impermanent, not lasting, and included within identity. It would be good to turn your mind away from the Brahmā realm and apply it to the cessation of identity.’ </p>
<p id="sn55.54:8.1">If they reply, ‘I have done so,’ then there is no difference between a lay follower whose mind is freed in this way and a mendicant whose mind is freed from defilements; that is, between the freedom of one and the other.” </p>

<p id="sn55.53:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana. Then the lay follower Dhammadinna, together with five hundred lay followers, went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="sn55.53:1.3">“May the Buddha please advise and instruct us. It will be for our lasting welfare and happiness.” </p>
<p id="sn55.53:2.1">“So, Dhammadinna, you should train like this: ‘From time to time we will undertake and dwell upon the discourses spoken by the Realized One that are deep, profound, transcendent, dealing with emptiness.’ That’s how you should train yourselves.” </p>
<p id="sn55.53:2.4">“Sir, we live at home with our children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, perfumes, and makeup, and accepting gold and money. It’s not easy for us to undertake and dwell from time to time upon the discourses spoken by the Realized One that are deep, profound, transcendent, dealing with emptiness.

There are more mendicants who, having ended the five lower fetters, are reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.’ </p>
<p id="sn55.52:6.1">In addition, I heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha: ‘There are fewer mendicants who, having ended the five lower fetters, are reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. There are more mendicants who, with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, are once-returners, who come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.’ </p>

<p id="sn55.30:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then Nandaka the Licchavi minister went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: </p>
<p id="sn55.30:2.1">“Nandaka, a noble disciple who has four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. What four? It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.

<p id="sn55.30:4.1">When he had spoken, a certain person said to Nandaka: </p>
<p id="sn55.30:4.2">“Sir, it is time to bathe.” </p>

<p id="sn55.28:1.1">At Sāvatthī. </p>
<p id="sn55.28:1.2">Seated to one side, the Buddha said to the householder Anāthapiṇḍika: </p>
<p id="sn55.28:1.3">“Householder, when a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble system with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’ </p>
<p id="sn55.28:2.1">What are the five dangers and threats they have quelled? Anyone who kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from killing living creatures. Anyone who steals … Anyone who commits sexual misconduct … Anyone who lies … Anyone who uses alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. These are the five dangers and threats they have quelled. </p>
<p id="sn55.28:3.1">What are the four factors of stream-entry that they have? It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion. These are the four factors of stream-entry that they have. </p>
<p id="sn55.28:4.1">And what is the noble system that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom? A noble disciple properly attends to dependent origination itself: ‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises. When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases.' That is: Ignorance is a condition for choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are a condition for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases. This is the noble system that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom. </p>
<p id="sn55.28:5.1">When a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble system with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’” </p>

And if anyone should rightly be said to have for a long time gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, it’s Sarakāni the Sakyan. Sarakāni the Sakyan has for a long time gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. How could he go to the underworld? </p>
<p id="sn55.24:4.1">Take a certain person who has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … They have laughing wisdom and swift wisdom, and are endowed with freedom. They’ve realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. This person is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld. </p>
<p id="sn55.24:5.1">Take another person who has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … They have laughing wisdom and swift wisdom, but are not endowed with freedom. With the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. This person, too, is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld. </p>

<p id="sn55.7:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Bamboo Gate. The brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate heard: </p>
<p id="sn55.7:1.4">“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Bamboo Gate, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.” </p>
<p id="sn55.7:2.1">Then the brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Seated to one side they said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="sn55.7:2.2">“Master Gotama, these are our wishes, desires, and hopes. We wish to live at home with our children; to use sandalwood imported from Kāsi; to wear garlands, perfumes, and makeup; and to accept gold and money. And when our body breaks up, after death, we wish to be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. Given that we have such wishes, may the Buddha teach us the Dhamma so that we may achieve them.” </p>
<p id="sn55.7:3.1">“Householders, I will teach you an explanation of the Dhamma that applies to oneself. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="sn55.7:3.3">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="sn55.7:4.1">“And what is the explanation of the Dhamma that applies to oneself? </p>
<p id="sn55.7:4.2">It’s when a noble disciple reflects: ‘I want to live and don’t want to die; I want to be happy and recoil from pain. Since this is so, if someone were to take my life, I wouldn’t like that. But others also want to live and don’t want to die; they want to be happy and recoil from pain. So if I were to take the life of someone else, they wouldn’t like that either. The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others. Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on someone else?’ Reflecting in this way, they give up killing living creatures themselves. And they encourage others to give up killing living creatures, praising the giving up of killing living creatures. So their bodily behavior is purified in three points. </p>
<p id="sn55.7:5.1">Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: ‘If someone were to steal from me, I wouldn’t like that. But if I were to steal from someone else, they wouldn’t like that either. The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others. Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on someone else?’ Reflecting in this way, they give up stealing themselves. And they encourage others to give up stealing, praising the giving up of stealing. So their bodily behavior is purified in three points. </p>
<p id="sn55.7:6.1">Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: ‘If someone were to have sexual relations with my wives, I wouldn’t like it. But if I were to have sexual relations with someone else’s wives, he wouldn’t like that either. The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others. Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on others?’ Reflecting in this way, they give up sexual misconduct themselves. And they encourage others to give up sexual misconduct, praising the giving up of sexual misconduct. So their bodily behavior is purified in three points. </p>
<p id="sn55.7:7.1">Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: ‘If someone were to distort my meaning by lying, I wouldn’t like it. But if I were to distort someone else’s meaning by lying, they wouldn’t like it either. The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by someone else. Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on others?’ Reflecting in this way, they give up lying themselves. And they encourage others to give up lying, praising the giving up of lying. So their verbal behavior is purified in three points. </p>
<p id="sn55.7:8.1">Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: ‘If someone were to break me up from my friends by divisive speech, I wouldn’t like it. But if I were to break someone else from their friends by divisive speech, they wouldn’t like it either. …’ So their verbal behavior is purified in three points. </p>
<p id="sn55.7:9.1">Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: ‘If someone were to attack me with harsh speech, I wouldn’t like it. But if I were to attack someone else with harsh speech, they wouldn’t like it either. …’ So their verbal behavior is purified in three points. </p>
<p id="sn55.7:10.1">Furthermore, a noble disciple reflects: ‘If someone were to annoy me by talking silliness and nonsense, I wouldn’t like it. But if I were to annoy someone else by talking silliness and nonsense, they wouldn’t like it either.’ The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by another. Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on another?’ Reflecting in this way, they give up talking nonsense themselves. And they encourage others to give up talking nonsense, praising the giving up of talking nonsense. So their verbal behavior is purified in three points. </p>
<p id="sn55.7:11.1">And they have experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion. When a noble disciple has these seven good qualities and these four desirable states they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’” </p>
<p id="sn55.7:12.1">When he had spoken, the brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate said to the Buddha, “Excellent, Master Gotama! … We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<p id="sn55.6:1.1">At Sāvatthī. At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering. Now at that time the chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa were residing in Sādhuka on some business. They heard about this. </p>
<p id="sn55.6:2.1">So they posted someone on the road, saying: </p>
<p id="sn55.6:2.2">“My good man, let us know when you see the Blessed One coming, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.” And that person stood there for two or three days before they saw the Buddha coming off in the distance. When they saw him, they went to the chamberlains and said: </p>
<p id="sn55.6:2.5">“Sirs, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is coming. Please come at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="sn55.6:3.1">Then the chamberlains went up to the Buddha, bowed, and followed behind him. And then the Buddha left the road, went to the root of a certain tree, and sat down on the seat spread out. The chamberlains Isidatta and Purāṇa bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="sn55.6:4.1">“Sir, when we hear that you will be setting out from Sāvatthī to wander in the Kosalan lands, we’re sad and upset, thinking that you will be far from us.

<p id="sn55.6:14.3">“Sir, for us there is something that’s even more cramped than that, and is considered as such.” </p>
<p id="sn55.6:14.4">“What is that?” </p>
<p id="sn55.6:15.1">“Sir, it’s when King Pasenadi of Kosala wants to go and visit a park. We have to harness and prepare his royal elephants. Then we have to seat his dear and beloved wives on the elephants, one in front of us, and one behind. Those sisters smell like a freshly opened perfume box; that’s how the royal ladies smell with makeup on. The touch of those sisters is like a tuft of cotton-wool or kapok; that’s how dainty the royal ladies are. Now at that time we must look after the elephants, the sisters, and ourselves. But we don’t recall having a bad thought regarding those sisters. This is that thing that’s even more cramped than that, and is considered as such.” </p>
<p id="sn55.6:16.1">“Well then, chamberlains, living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. Just this much is enough to be diligent. A noble disciple who has four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. </p>

<p id="sn55.3:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. </p>
<p id="sn55.3:1.2">Now at that time the lay follower Dīghāvu was sick, suffering, gravely ill. Then he addressed his father, the householder Jotika, “Please, householder, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him: ‘Sir, the lay follower Dīghāvu is sick, suffering, gravely ill. He bows with his head to your feet.’ And then say: ‘Sir, please visit him at his home out of compassion.’” </p>
<p id="sn55.3:1.9">“Yes, dear,” replied Jotika. He did as Dīghāvu asked. The Buddha consented with silence. </p>
<p id="sn55.3:2.1">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the lay follower Dīghāvu, sat down on the seat spread out, and said to him, “I hope you’re keeping well, Dīghāvu; I hope you’re alright. I hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.” </p>
<p id="sn55.3:2.3">“Sir, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.” </p>
<p id="sn55.3:2.4">“So, Dīghāvu, you should train like this: ‘I will have experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … And I will have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.’ That’s how you should train.” </p>
<p id="sn55.3:3.1">“Sir, these four factors of stream-entry that were taught by the Buddha are found in me, and I exhibit them. For I have experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the Saṅgha … And I have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.” </p>
<p id="sn55.3:3.6">“In that case, Dīghāvu, grounded on these four factors of stream-entry you should further develop these six things that play a part in realization. You should meditate observing the impermanence of all conditions, perceiving suffering in impermanence, perceiving not-self in suffering, perceiving giving up, perceiving fading away, and perceiving cessation. That’s how you should train.” </p>
<p id="sn55.3:4.1">“These six things that play a part in realization that were taught by the Buddha are found in me, and I exhibit them.

<p id="sn55.3:4.3">But still, sir, I think, ‘I hope Jotika doesn’t suffer anguish when I’ve gone.’” Jotika said, “Dear Dīghāvu, don’t focus on that. Come on, dear Dīghāvu, you should closely focus on what the Buddha is saying.” </p>
<p id="sn55.3:5.1">When the Buddha had given this advice he got up from his seat and left. Not long after the Buddha left, Dīghāvu passed away. Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>

<p id="sn55.1:2.4">They have experiential confidence in the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ </p>
<p id="sn55.1:2.6">They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ </p>
<p id="sn55.1:2.8">Furthermore, a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. </p>
<p id="sn55.1:2.9">These are the four qualities that they have. </p>
<p id="sn55.1:2.10">And, mendicants, gaining these four continents is not worth a sixteenth part of gaining these four things.” </p>

It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in front of them. Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. Breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ … They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="sn54.13:5.1">There’s a time when a mendicant is breathing in heavily, and they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ … They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling physical processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling physical processes.’ At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world.

Why is that? Because there is no development of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing for someone who is unmindful and lacks awareness, I say.

<p id="sn54.12:1.1">At one time Venerable Lomasavaṅgīsa was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to Venerable Lomasavaṅgīsa, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, is the meditation of a trainee just the same as the meditation of a Realized One? Or is the meditation of a trainee different from the meditation of a Realized One?” </p>
<p id="sn54.12:2.1">“Reverend Mahānāma, the meditation of a trainee and a realized one are not the same; they are different. Those mendicants who are trainees haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring for the supreme sanctuary. They meditate after giving up the five hindrances. What five? The hindrances of sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. </p>
<p id="sn54.12:3.1">Those who are trainee mendicants … meditate after giving up the five hindrances. </p>
<p id="sn54.12:4.1">Those mendicants who are perfected—who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment—for them, the five hindrances are cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. What five? The hindrances of sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. </p>
<p id="sn54.12:5.1">Those mendicants who are perfected—who have ended the defilements … for them, the five hindrances are cut off at the root … and unable to arise in the future. And here’s another way to understand how the meditation of a trainee and a realized one are different. </p>
<p id="sn54.12:6.1">At one time the Buddha was staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. There he addressed the mendicants, ‘Mendicants, I wish to go on retreat for three months. No-one should approach me, except for the one who brings my almsfood.’ </p>
<p id="sn54.12:6.5">‘Yes, sir,’ replied those mendicants. And no-one approached him, except for the one who brought the almsfood. </p>
<p id="sn54.12:7.1">Then after three months had passed, the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants: </p>
<p id="sn54.12:7.2">‘Mendicants, if wanderers who follow another religion were to ask you: “Reverends, what was the ascetic Gotama’s usual meditation during the rainy season residence?” You should answer them like this: “Reverends, the ascetic Gotama’s usual meditation during the rainy season residence was immersion due to mindfulness of breathing.” </p>
<p id="sn54.12:7.5">In this regard: mindful, I breathe in. Mindful, I breathe out. </p>
<p id="sn54.12:7.6">Breathing in heavily I know: “I’m breathing in heavily.” Breathing out heavily I know: “I’m breathing out heavily.” … </p>
<p id="sn54.12:7.7">I know: “I’ll breathe in observing letting go.” I know: “I’ll breathe out observing letting go.” </p>
<p id="sn54.12:8.1">For if anything should be rightly called “the meditation of a noble one”, or else “the meditation of a Brahmā”, or else “the meditation of a realized one”, it’s immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. </p>
<p id="sn54.12:9.1">For those mendicants who are trainees—who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring for the supreme sanctuary—the development and cultivation of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing leads to the ending of defilements. </p>
<p id="sn54.12:10.1">For those mendicants who are perfected—who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment—the development and cultivation of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing leads to blissful meditation in the present life, and to mindfulness and awareness. </p>

<p id="sn54.11:1.5">“Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. And no-one approached him, except for the one who brought the almsfood. </p>
<p id="sn54.11:2.1">Then after three months had passed, the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants: </p>
<p id="sn54.11:2.2">“Mendicants, if wanderers who follow another religion were to ask you: ‘Reverends, what was the ascetic Gotama’s usual meditation during the rainy season residence?’ You should answer them like this. ‘Reverends, the ascetic Gotama’s usual meditation during the rainy season residence was immersion due to mindfulness of breathing.’ </p>
<p id="sn54.11:2.5">In this regard: mindful, I breathe in. Mindful, I breathe out. </p>
<p id="sn54.11:2.6">Breathing in heavily I know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily I know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ When breathing in lightly I know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ Breathing out lightly I know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’ I know: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ … </p>
<p id="sn54.11:2.9">I know: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ I know: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ </p>
<p id="sn54.11:3.1">For if anything should be rightly called ‘the meditation of a noble one’, or else ‘the meditation of a Brahmā’, or else ‘the meditation of a realized one’, it’s immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. </p>
<p id="sn54.11:3.5">For those mendicants who are trainees—who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary—the development and cultivation of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing leads to the ending of defilements. </p>
<p id="sn54.11:3.6">For those mendicants who are perfected—who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment—the development and cultivation of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing leads to blissful meditation in the present life, and to mindfulness and awareness. </p>
<p id="sn54.11:4.1">For if anything should be rightly called ‘the meditation of a noble one’, or else ‘the meditation of a Brahmā’, or else ‘the meditation of a realized one’, it’s immersion due to mindfulness of breathing.” </p>

<p id="sn54.10:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Kimbilā in the Freshwater Mangrove Wood. Then the Buddha said to Venerable Kimbila, “Kimbila, how is immersion due to mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is very fruitful and beneficial?” </p>
<p id="sn54.10:2.1">When he said this, Kimbila kept silent. </p>
<p id="sn54.10:2.2">For a second time … </p>
<p id="sn54.10:2.3">And for a third time, the Buddha said to him, “How is immersion due to mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is very fruitful and beneficial?” And a second time and a third time Kimbila kept silent. </p>
<p id="sn54.10:3.1">When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, “Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! Let the Buddha speak on immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” </p>
<p id="sn54.10:4.1">“Well then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="sn54.10:4.2">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="sn54.10:4.4">“Ānanda, how is immersion due to mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is very fruitful and beneficial? It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in front of them. </p>
<p id="sn54.10:4.6">Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. … </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="sn54.10:4.7">They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ That’s how immersion due to mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated, is very fruitful and beneficial. </p>
<p id="sn54.10:5.1">There’s a time when a mendicant is breathing in heavily, and they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ Breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling physical processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling physical processes.’ At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. Why is that? Because the breath is a certain aspect of the body, I say. Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="sn54.10:6.1">There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing rapture.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing rapture.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing bliss.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing bliss.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling mental processes.’ At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. Why is that? Because close focus on the breath is a certain aspect of feelings, I say. Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="sn54.10:7.1">There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in gladdening the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out gladdening the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in immersing the mind in samādhi.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out immersing the mind in samādhi.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in freeing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out freeing the mind.’ At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. Why is that? Because there is no development of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing for someone who is unmindful and lacks awareness, I say. Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="sn54.10:8.1">There’s a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing impermanence.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing impermanence.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing fading away.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing fading away.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing cessation.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing cessation.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. Having seen with wisdom the giving up of covetousness and bitterness, they watch closely over with equanimity. Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. </p>
<p id="sn54.10:9.1">Suppose there was a large heap of sand at the crossroads. And a cart or chariot were to come by from the east, west, north, or south and destroy that heap of sand. </p>
<p id="sn54.10:9.6">In the same way, when a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body, feelings, mind, or principles, they destroy bad, unskillful qualities.” </p>

<p id="sn54.9:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Now at that time the Buddha spoke in many ways to the mendicants about the meditation on ugliness. He praised the meditation on ugliness and its development. </p>
<p id="sn54.9:2.1">Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, “Mendicants, I wish to go on retreat for a fortnight. No-one should approach me, except for the one who brings my almsfood.” </p>
<p id="sn54.9:2.4">“Yes, sir,” replied those mendicants. And no-one approached him, except for the one who brought the almsfood. </p>
<p id="sn54.9:3.1">Then those mendicants thought, “The Buddha spoke in many ways about the meditation on ugliness. He praised the meditation on ugliness and its development.” They committed themselves to developing the many different facets of the meditation on ugliness. Becoming horrified, repelled, and disgusted with this body, they looked for someone to slit their wrists. Each day ten, twenty, or thirty mendicants slit their wrists. </p>
<p id="sn54.9:4.1">Then after a fortnight had passed, the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed Ānanda, “Ānanda, why does the mendicant Saṅgha seem so diminished?” </p>
<p id="sn54.9:4.3">Ānanda told the Buddha all that had happened, and said, “Sir, please explain another way for the mendicant Saṅgha to get enlightened.” </p>
<p id="sn54.9:5.1">“Well then, Ānanda, gather all the mendicants staying in the vicinity of Vesālī together in the assembly hall.” </p>
<p id="sn54.9:5.2">“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He did what the Buddha asked, went up to him, and said, “Sir, the mendicant Saṅgha has assembled. Please, sir, come at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="sn54.9:6.1">Then the Buddha went to the assembly hall, sat down on the seat spread out, and addressed the mendicants: </p>
<p id="sn54.9:6.3">“Mendicants, when this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it’s peaceful and sublime, a deliciously pleasant meditation. And it disperses and settles unskillful qualities on the spot whenever they arise. </p>
<p id="sn54.9:7.1">In the last month of summer, when the dust and dirt is stirred up, a large sudden storm disperses and settles it on the spot. </p>
<p id="sn54.9:7.2">In the same way, when this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it’s peaceful and sublime, a deliciously pleasant meditation. And it disperses and settles unskillful qualities on the spot whenever they arise. And how is it so developed and cultivated? </p>
<p id="sn54.9:8.1">It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in front of them. </p>

<p id="sn54.8:3.1">Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too usually practiced this kind of meditation. And while I was usually practicing this kind of meditation neither my body nor my eyes became fatigued. And my mind was freed from defilements by not grasping. </p>
<p id="sn54.8:4.1">Now, a mendicant might wish: ‘May neither my body nor my eyes became fatigued. And may my mind be freed from the defilements by not grasping.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. </p>
<p id="sn54.8:5.1">Now, a mendicant might wish: ‘May I give up memories and thoughts of the lay life.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. </p>
<p id="sn54.8:6.1">Now, a mendicant might wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. </p>
<p id="sn54.8:7.1">Now, a mendicant might wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. </p>

<p id="sn54.8:10.1">Now, a mendicant might wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. </p>
<p id="sn54.8:11.1">Now, a mendicant might wish: ‘Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, may I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. </p>
<p id="sn54.8:12.1">Now, a mendicant might wish: ‘As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, may I enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. </p>
<p id="sn54.8:13.1">Now, a mendicant might wish: ‘With the fading away of rapture, may I enter and remain in the third absorption, where I will meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, “Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.”’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. </p>
<p id="sn54.8:14.1">Now, a mendicant might wish: ‘With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, may I enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. </p>
<p id="sn54.8:15.1">Now, a mendicant might wish: ‘Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that “space is infinite”, may I enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. </p>

<p id="sn54.8:17.1">Now, a mendicant might wish: ‘Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that “there is nothing at all”, may I enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. </p>
<p id="sn54.8:18.1">Now, a mendicant might wish: ‘Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, may I enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. </p>
<p id="sn54.8:19.1">Now, a mendicant might wish: ‘Going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, may I enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. </p>
<p id="sn54.8:20.1">When immersion due to mindfulness of breathing has been developed and cultivated in this way, if they feel a pleasant feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. If they feel a painful feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. If they feel a neutral feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. </p>
<p id="sn54.8:21.1">If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it detached. If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it detached. If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it detached. Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’ They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here.’ </p>
<p id="sn54.8:22.1">Suppose an oil lamp depended on oil and a wick to burn. As the oil and the wick are used up, it would be extinguished due to lack of fuel.

<p id="sn54.1:1.3">“Mendicants, when one thing is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. What one thing? Mindfulness of breathing. </p>
<p id="sn54.1:1.6">And how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial? </p>
<p id="sn54.1:1.7">It’s when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in front of them. </p>

<p id="sn54.1:2.1">Breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ Breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling physical processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling physical processes.’ </p>

<p id="sn54.1:4.1">They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in gladdening the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out gladdening the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in immersing the mind in samādhi.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out immersing the mind in samādhi.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in freeing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out freeing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing impermanence.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing impermanence.’ </p>
<p id="sn54.1:5.1">They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing fading away.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing fading away.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing cessation.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing cessation.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ </p>

<p id="sn52.9:1.1">At one time the venerables Anuruddha and Sāriputta were staying near Vesālī, in Ambapālī’s Mango Grove. Then in the late afternoon, Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Anuruddha, and said to him: </p>
<p id="sn52.9:2.1">“Reverend Anuruddha, your faculties are so very clear, and your complexion is pure and bright. What kind of meditation are you usually practicing these days?” </p>
<p id="sn52.9:2.3">“These days, reverend, I usually meditate with my mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. What four? I meditate observing an aspect of the body … feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. These days I usually meditate with my mind firmly established in these four kinds of mindfulness meditation. A mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—usually meditates with their mind firmly established in these four kinds of mindfulness meditation.” </p>

<p id="sn52.8:1.1">At one time Venerable Anuruddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the frankincense-tree hut. There Venerable Anuruddha addressed the mendicants: “Reverends, suppose that, although the Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east, a large crowd were to come along with a spade and basket, saying: ‘We’ll make this Ganges river slant, slope, and incline to the west!’ What do you think, reverends? Would they succeed?” </p>
<p id="sn52.8:1.7">“No, reverend. Why is that? The Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east. It’s not easy to make it slant, slope, and incline to the west. That large crowd will eventually get weary and frustrated.” </p>
<p id="sn52.8:2.1">“In the same way, while a mendicant develops and cultivates the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, if rulers or their ministers, friends or colleagues, relatives or family should invite them to accept wealth, saying: ‘Please, mister, why let these ocher robes torment you? Why follow the practice of shaving your head and carrying an alms bowl? Come, return to a lesser life, enjoy wealth, and make merit!’ </p>
<p id="sn52.8:3.1">It’s simply impossible for a mendicant who is developing and cultivating the four kinds of mindfulness meditation to resign the training and return to a lesser life. Why is that? Because for a long time that mendicant’s mind has slanted, sloped, and inclined to seclusion. So it’s impossible for them to return to a lesser life. </p>
<p id="sn52.8:3.4">And how does a mendicant develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body … feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. That’s how a mendicant develops and cultivates the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.” </p>

<p id="sn51.20:1.1">“Mendicants, when the four bases of psychic power are developed and cultivated they’re very fruitful and beneficial. </p>
<p id="sn51.20:2.1">How so? It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort. They think: ‘My enthusiasm won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.’ And they meditate perceiving continuity: as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance. </p>
<p id="sn51.20:2.9">They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy … mental development … inquiry, and active effort. They think: ‘My inquiry won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.’ And they meditate perceiving continuity: as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance. </p>
<p id="sn51.20:3.1">And what is enthusiasm that’s too lax? It’s when enthusiasm is combined with laziness. This is called lax enthusiasm. </p>
<p id="sn51.20:4.1">And what is enthusiasm that’s too tense? It’s when enthusiasm is combined with restlessness. This is called tense enthusiasm. </p>
<p id="sn51.20:5.1">And what is enthusiasm that’s constricted internally? It’s when enthusiasm is combined with dullness and drowsiness. This is called enthusiasm constricted internally. </p>
<p id="sn51.20:6.1">And what is enthusiasm that’s distracted externally? It’s when enthusiasm is frequently distracted and diffused externally on account of the five kinds of sensual stimulation. This is called enthusiasm distracted externally. </p>
<p id="sn51.20:7.1">And how does a mendicant meditate perceiving continuity: as before, so after; as after, so before? It’s when the perception of continuity is properly grasped, attended, borne in mind, and comprehended with wisdom by a mendicant. That’s how a mendicant meditates perceiving continuity: as before, so after; as after, so before. </p>
<p id="sn51.20:8.1">And how does a mendicant meditate as below, so above; as above, so below? It’s when a mendicant examines their own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth. ‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’ That’s how a mendicant meditates as below, so above; as above, so below. </p>
<p id="sn51.20:9.1">And how does a mendicant meditate as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day? It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort, with the same features, attributes, and signs by day as by night. And they develop it with the same features, attributes, and signs by night as by day. That’s how a mendicant meditates as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. </p>
<p id="sn51.20:10.1">And how, with an open and unenveloped heart, does a mendicant develop a mind that’s full of radiance? It’s when a mendicant has properly grasped the perception of light, and has properly grasped the perception of day. That’s how, with an open and unenveloped heart, a mendicant develops a mind that’s full of radiance. </p>
<p id="sn51.20:11.1">And what is energy that’s too lax? … </p>
<p id="sn51.20:16.1">And what is mental development that’s too lax? … </p>
<p id="sn51.20:20.1">And what is inquiry that’s too lax? It’s when inquiry is combined with laziness. This is called lax inquiry. </p>
<p id="sn51.20:21.1">And what is inquiry that’s too tense? It’s when inquiry is combined with restlessness. This is called tense inquiry. </p>

<p id="sn51.20:23.1">And what is inquiry that’s distracted externally? It’s when inquiry is frequently distracted and diffused externally on account of the five kinds of sensual stimulation. This is called inquiry distracted externally. … That’s how, with an open and unenveloped heart, a mendicant develops a mind that’s full of radiance.

<p id="sn51.15:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery. Then Uṇṇābha the brahmin went up to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him, “Master Ānanda, what’s the purpose of leading the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama?” </p>
<p id="sn51.15:1.6">“The purpose of leading the spiritual life under the Buddha, brahmin, is to give up desire.” </p>
<p id="sn51.15:2.1">“But is there a path and a practice for giving up that desire?” </p>
<p id="sn51.15:2.2">“There is.” </p>
<p id="sn51.15:3.1">“What is that path?” </p>
<p id="sn51.15:3.2">“It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm … energy … mental development … inquiry, and active effort. This is the path and the practice for giving up that desire.” </p>
<p id="sn51.15:4.1">“This being the case, Master Ānanda, the path is endless, not finite. For it’s not possible to give up desire by means of desire.” </p>
<p id="sn51.15:4.3">“Well then, brahmin, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. What do you think, brahmin? Have you ever had a desire to walk to the park, but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding desire faded away?” </p>
<p id="sn51.15:4.7">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn51.15:4.8">“Have you ever had the energy to walk to the park, but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding energy faded away?” </p>
<p id="sn51.15:4.10">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn51.15:4.11">“Have you ever had the idea to walk to the park, but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding idea faded away?” </p>
<p id="sn51.15:4.13">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn51.15:4.14">“Have you ever inquired regarding a walk to the park, but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding inquiry faded away?” </p>
<p id="sn51.15:4.16">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn51.15:5.1">“In the same way, take a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment. They formerly had the desire to attain perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding desire faded away. They formerly had the energy to attain perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding energy faded away. They formerly had the idea to attain perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding idea faded away. They formerly inquired regarding attaining perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding inquiry faded away. What do you think, brahmin? This being the case, is the path endless or finite?” </p>
<p id="sn51.15:6.1">“Clearly, Master Ānanda, this being the case, the path is finite, not endless. Excellent, Master Ānanda! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Ānanda has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Ānanda remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<p id="sn51.14:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. Now at that time several mendicants were staying beneath the longhouse. They were restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties. </p>
<p id="sn51.14:2.1">Then the Buddha addressed Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, “These spiritual companions of yours staying beneath the longhouse are restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with wandering mind and undisciplined faculties. Go, Moggallāna, and strike awe in those mendicants!” </p>
<p id="sn51.14:3.1">“Yes, sir,” replied Mahāmoggallāna. Then he used his psychic power to make the longhouse shake and rock and tremble with his toe. Then those mendicants stood to one side, shocked and awestruck. </p>
<p id="sn51.14:3.3">“It’s incredible, it’s amazing! There’s no wind at all; and this stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother has deep foundations. It’s firmly embedded, imperturbable and unshakable. And yet it shakes and rocks and trembles!” </p>
<p id="sn51.14:4.1">Then the Buddha went up to those mendicants and said: </p>
<p id="sn51.14:4.2">“Why do you, mendicants, stand to one side, shocked and awestruck?” </p>

<p id="sn51.14:4.8">“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” </p>
<p id="sn51.14:5.1">“Well then, mendicants, listen. The mendicant Moggallāna has become so powerful and mighty by developing and cultivating the four bases of psychic power. What four? Moggallāna develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm … energy … mental development … inquiry, and active effort. He thinks: ‘My inquiry won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.’ And he meditates perceiving continuity: as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, he develops a mind that’s full of radiance.

<h5 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">SN 51.10</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">At the Cāpāla Shrine </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Cetiyasutta</span></h5>
<p id="sn51.10:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms. Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, get your sitting cloth. Let’s go to the Cāpāla shrine for the day’s meditation.” </p>
<p id="sn51.10:1.7">“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha. </p>
<p id="sn51.10:2.1">Then the Buddha went up to the Cāpāla shrine, and sat down on the seat spread out. Ānanda bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: </p>
<p id="sn51.10:3.1">“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Seven Maidens, Many Sons, Sārandada, and Cāpāla Tree-shrines are all lovely. Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it. The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.” </p>
<p id="sn51.10:4.1">But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. He didn’t beg the Buddha, “Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra. </p>
<p id="sn51.10:5.1">For a second time … and for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda: </p>
<p id="sn51.10:5.3">“Ānanda, Vesālī is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Seven Maidens, Many Sons, Sārandada, and Cāpāla Tree-shrines are all lovely. Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it. The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live for the proper lifespan or what’s left of it.” </p>
<p id="sn51.10:6.1">But Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. He didn’t beg the Buddha, “Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra. </p>
<p id="sn51.10:7.1">Then the Buddha said to him, “Go now, Ānanda, at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="sn51.10:7.4">“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He rose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before sitting at the root of a tree close by. </p>
<p id="sn51.10:8.1">And then, not long after Ānanda had left, Māra the Wicked went up to the the Buddha and said to him: </p>
<p id="sn51.10:9.1">“Sir, may the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have monk disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned, have memorized the teachings, and practice in line with the teachings. Not until they practice properly, living in line with the teaching. Not until they’ve learned their own tradition, and explain, teach, assert, establish, disclose, analyze, and make it clear. Not until they can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable basis.’ </p>
<p id="sn51.10:10.1">Today you do have such monk disciples. May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. </p>
<p id="sn51.10:11.1">Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have nun disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ … </p>
<p id="sn51.10:12.1">Today you do have such nun disciples. May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. </p>
<p id="sn51.10:13.1">Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have layman disciples … and laywoman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ … </p>
<p id="sn51.10:14.1">Today you do have such layman and laywoman disciples. May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. </p>
<p id="sn51.10:15.1">Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until my spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.’ Today your spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans. May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.” </p>
<p id="sn51.10:16.1">When this was said, the Buddha said to Māra, “Relax, Wicked One. The final extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon. Three months from now the Realized One will finally be extinguished.” </p>
<p id="sn51.10:17.1">So at the Cāpāla Tree-shrine the Buddha, mindful and aware, surrendered the life force. When he did so there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky. Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn51.10:18.1">“Comparing the incomparable <j>with the creation of prolonged life, </j><br/>the sage surrendered the life force. <br/>Happy inside, serene, <br/>he shattered self-creation like a suit of armor.” </p>

<p id="sn48.53:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, is there a way that a mendicant who is a trainee, standing at the level of a trainee, can understand that they are a trainee? And that a mendicant who is an adept, standing at the level of an adept, can understand that they are an adept?” </p>
<p id="sn48.53:2.1">“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. …” </p>

<p id="sn48.53:3.1">And what is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee? It’s when a mendicant who is a trainee truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. This is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee. </p>

<p id="sn48.53:5.1">Furthermore, a mendicant who is a trainee understands the five faculties: faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. And although they don’t have direct meditative experience of their destination, apex, fruit, and culmination, they do see them with penetrating wisdom. This too is a way that a mendicant who is a trainee can understand that they are a trainee. </p>
<p id="sn48.53:6.1">And what is the way that a mendicant who is an adept can understand that they are an adept?

This is a way that a mendicant who is an adept can understand that they are an adept. </p>
<p id="sn48.53:7.1">Furthermore, a mendicant who is an adept understands the six faculties: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. They understand: ‘These six faculties will totally and utterly cease without anything left over. And no other six faculties will arise anywhere anyhow.’ This too is a way that a mendicant who is an adept can understand that they are an adept.” </p>

No first point is found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving. But when that dark mass of ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, that state is peaceful and sublime. That is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.’ For their noble wisdom is the faculty of wisdom. </p>
<p id="sn48.50:6.1">When a noble disciple has tried again and again, recollected again and again, entered immersion again and again, and understood with wisdom again and again, they will be confident of this: ‘I have previously heard of these things.

<p id="sn48.43:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāketa in the deer park at the Añjana Wood. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, is there a method in which the five faculties become the five powers, and the five powers become the five faculties?” </p>
<p id="sn48.43:2.1">“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” </p>
<p id="sn48.43:3.1">“Mendicants, there is a method in which the five faculties become the five powers, and the five powers become the five faculties. </p>
<p id="sn48.43:4.1">And what is that method? The faculty of faith is the power of faith, and the power of faith is the faculty of faith. The faculty of energy is the power of energy, and the power of energy is the faculty of energy. The faculty of mindfulness is the power of mindfulness, and the power of mindfulness is the faculty of mindfulness. The faculty of immersion is the power of immersion, and the power of immersion is the faculty of immersion. The faculty of wisdom is the power of wisdom, and the power of wisdom is the faculty of wisdom. </p>
<p id="sn48.43:4.7">Suppose that there was a river slanting, sloping, and inclining to the east, and in the middle was an island. There’s a method in which that river can be reckoned to have just one stream. But there’s also a method in which that river can be reckoned to have two streams. </p>
<p id="sn48.43:5.1">And what’s the method in which that river can be reckoned to have just one stream? By taking into account the water to the east and the west of the island, that river can be reckoned to have just one stream. </p>
<p id="sn48.43:6.1">And what’s the method in which that river can be reckoned to have two streams? By taking into account the water to the north and the south of the island, that river can be reckoned to have two streams. </p>
<p id="sn48.43:6.4">By the same method, the faculty of faith is the power of faith, and the power of faith is the faculty of faith. The faculty of energy is the power of energy, and the power of energy is the faculty of energy. The faculty of mindfulness is the power of mindfulness, and the power of mindfulness is the faculty of mindfulness.

<p id="sn48.42:1.2">Then Uṇṇābha the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="sn48.42:2.1">“Master Gotama, these five faculties have different scopes and different ranges, and don’t experience each others’ scope and range. What five? The faculties of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body. What do these five faculties, with their different scopes and ranges, have recourse to? What experiences their scopes and ranges?” </p>
<p id="sn48.42:3.1">“Brahmin, these five faculties have different scopes and different ranges, and don’t experience each others’ scope and range. What five? The faculties of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body. These five faculties, with their different scopes and ranges, have recourse to the mind. And the mind experiences their scopes and ranges.” </p>
<p id="sn48.42:4.1">“But Master Gotama, what does the mind have recourse to?” </p>
<p id="sn48.42:4.2">“The mind has recourse to mindfulness.” </p>
<p id="sn48.42:4.3">“But what does mindfulness have recourse to?” </p>
<p id="sn48.42:4.4">“Mindfulness has recourse to freedom.” </p>
<p id="sn48.42:4.5">“But what does freedom have recourse to?” </p>
<p id="sn48.42:4.6">“Freedom has recourse to extinguishment.” </p>
<p id="sn48.42:4.7">“But what does extinguishment have recourse to?” </p>
<p id="sn48.42:4.8">“This question goes too far, brahmin! You weren’t able to grasp the limit of questioning. For extinguishment is the culmination, destination, and end of the spiritual life.” </p>
<p id="sn48.42:5.1">And then the brahmin Uṇṇābha approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. </p>
<p id="sn48.42:6.1">Then, not long after he had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Suppose there was a bungalow or a hall with a peaked roof, with windows on the eastern side. When the sun rises and a ray of light enters through a window, where would it land?” </p>
<p id="sn48.42:6.3">“On the western wall, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn48.42:6.4">“In the same way, the brahmin Uṇṇābha’s faith in the Realized One is settled, rooted, and planted deep. It’s strong and can’t be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world. If he were to pass away at this time, he would be bound by no fetter that might return him to this world.” </p>

<p id="sn48.41:2.1">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and while massaging the Buddha’s limbs he said: </p>
<p id="sn48.41:2.2">“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing, how the complexion of your skin is no longer pure and bright. Your limbs are flaccid and wrinkled, and your body is stooped. And it’s apparent that there has been a deterioration in your faculties of eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body.” </p>

And that has a foundation, a source, a condition, and a reason. It’s not possible for the faculty of pain to arise without a foundation, a source, a condition, or a reason.’ They understand the faculty of pain, its origin, its cessation, and where that faculty of pain that’s arisen ceases without anything left over. And where does that faculty of pain that’s arisen cease without anything left over? It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. That’s where the faculty of pain that’s arisen ceases without anything left over. They’re called a mendicant who understands the cessation of the faculty of pain, and who applies their mind to that end. </p>

They’re called a mendicant who understands the cessation of the faculty of sadness, and who applies their mind to that end. </p>
<p id="sn48.40:3.1">While a mendicant is meditating—diligent, keen, and resolute—the faculty of pleasure arises. They understand: ‘The faculty of pleasure has arisen in me. And that has a foundation, a source, a condition, and a reason. It’s not possible for the faculty of pleasure to arise without a foundation, a source, a condition, or a reason.’ They understand the faculty of pleasure, its origin, its cessation, and where that faculty of pleasure that’s arisen ceases without anything left over. And where does that faculty of pleasure that’s arisen cease without anything left over? It’s when, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ That’s where the faculty of pleasure that’s arisen ceases without anything left over.

And where does that faculty of happiness that’s arisen cease without anything left over? It’s when, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. That’s where the faculty of happiness that’s arisen ceases without anything left over. They’re called a mendicant who understands the cessation of the faculty of happiness, and who applies their mind to that end. </p>
<p id="sn48.40:5.1">While a mendicant is meditating—diligent, keen, and resolute—the faculty of equanimity arises. They understand: ‘The faculty of equanimity has arisen in me. And that has a foundation, a source, a condition, and a reason. It’s not possible for the faculty of equanimity to arise without a foundation, a source, a condition, or a reason.’ They understand the faculty of equanimity, its origin, its cessation, and where that faculty of equanimity that’s arisen ceases without anything left over. And where does that faculty of equanimity that’s arisen cease without anything left over? It’s when a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling. That’s where the faculty of equanimity that’s arisen ceases without anything left over.

<p id="sn47.43:1.1">At Sāvatthī. </p>
<p id="sn47.43:1.2">There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, at one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying near Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. As I was in private retreat this thought came to mind: ‘The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment. </p>
<p id="sn47.43:2.1">What four? A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. Or they’d meditate observing an aspect of feelings … or mind … or principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment.’ </p>
<p id="sn47.43:3.1">And then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what I was thinking, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of me. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: ‘That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! Sir, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment. </p>
<p id="sn47.43:4.1">What four? A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world.

<p id="sn47.43:5.1">That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he went on to say: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn47.43:6.1">“The compassionate one, <j>who sees the ending of rebirth, </j><br/>understands the path to convergence. <br/>By this path people crossed over before, <br/>will cross over, and are crossing over.’” </p>

<p id="sn47.15:1.4">“Well then, Bāhiya, you should purify the starting point of skillful qualities. What is the starting point of skillful qualities? Well purified ethics and correct view. When your ethics are well purified and your view is correct, you should develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, depending on and grounded on ethics. </p>
<p id="sn47.15:2.1">What four? Meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world.

<p id="sn47.14:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Vajjis near Ukkacelā on the bank of the Ganges river, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. It was not long after Sāriputta and Moggallāna had become fully extinguished. Now, at that time the Buddha was sitting in the open, surrounded by the Saṅgha of mendicants. </p>
<p id="sn47.14:2.1">Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of mendicants, who were silent. He addressed them: </p>
<p id="sn47.14:2.2">“Mendicants, this assembly seems empty to me now that Sāriputta and Moggallāna have become fully extinguished. When Sāriputta and Moggallāna were alive, my assembly was never empty; I had no concern for any region where they stayed. The Buddhas of the past or the future have pairs of chief disciples who are no better than Sāriputta and Moggallāna were to me. </p>
<p id="sn47.14:2.7">It’s an incredible and amazing quality of such disciples that they fulfill the Teacher’s instructions and follow his advice. And they’re liked and approved, respected and admired by the four assemblies. </p>
<p id="sn47.14:2.9">And it’s an incredible and amazing quality of the Realized One that when such a pair of disciples becomes fully extinguished he does not sorrow or lament. How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out? That is not possible. </p>
<p id="sn47.14:2.13">Suppose there was a large tree standing with heartwood, and the largest branches fell off. In the same way, in the great Saṅgha that stands with heartwood, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have become fully extinguished. </p>
<p id="sn47.14:2.15">How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out? That is not possible. </p>
<p id="sn47.14:2.17">So mendicants, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge. </p>
<p id="sn47.14:3.1">And how does a mendicant do this? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world.

<p id="sn47.13:2.1">Then Venerable Sāriputta became fully extinguished because of that sickness. Then Cunda took Sāriputta’s bowl and robes and set out for Sāvatthī. He went to see Venerable Ānanda at Jeta’s grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>

<p id="sn47.13:3.1">“Reverend Cunda, we should see the Buddha about this matter. Come, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this.” </p>
<p id="sn47.13:3.3">“Yes, sir,” replied Cunda. </p>
<p id="sn47.13:4.1">Then Ānanda and Cunda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="sn47.13:4.2">“Sir, this novice Cunda says that Venerable Sāriputta has become fully extinguished. This is his bowl and robe. Since I heard this, my body feels like it’s drugged. I’m disorientated, and the teachings don’t spring to mind.” </p>
<p id="sn47.13:5.1">“Well, Ānanda, when Sāriputta became fully extinguished, did he take away your entire spectrum of ethical conduct, of immersion, of wisdom, of freedom, or of the knowledge and vision of freedom?” </p>
<p id="sn47.13:5.2">“No, sir, he did not. But Venerable Sāriputta was my adviser and counselor. He educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired me. He never tired of teaching the Dhamma, and he supported his spiritual companions. I remember the nectar of the teaching, the riches of the teaching, the support of the teaching given by Venerable Sāriputta.” </p>
<p id="sn47.13:6.1">“Ānanda, did I not prepare for this when I explained that we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved? How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out? That is not possible. </p>

<p id="sn47.12:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Nāḷandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove. Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="sn47.12:1.3">“Sir, I have such confidence in the Buddha that I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.” </p>
<p id="sn47.12:1.5">“That’s a grand and dramatic statement, Sāriputta. You’ve roared a definitive, categorical lion’s roar, saying: ‘I have such confidence in the Buddha that I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.’ </p>
<p id="sn47.12:2.1">What about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past? Have you comprehended their minds to know that those Buddhas had such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?” </p>
<p id="sn47.12:2.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn47.12:3.1">“And what about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future? Have you comprehended their minds to know that those Buddhas will have such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?” </p>
<p id="sn47.12:3.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn47.12:4.1">“And what about me, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present? Have you comprehended my mind to know that I have such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?” </p>
<p id="sn47.12:4.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn47.12:5.1">“Well then, Sāriputta, given that you don’t comprehend the minds of Buddhas past, future, or present, what exactly are you doing, making such a grand and dramatic statement, roaring such a definitive, categorical lion’s roar?” </p>
<p id="sn47.12:6.1">“Sir, though I don’t comprehend the minds of Buddhas past, future, and present, still I understand this by inference from the teaching. Suppose there was a king’s frontier citadel with fortified embankments, ramparts, and arches, and a single gate. And it has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and intelligent. He keeps strangers out and lets known people in. As he walks around the patrol path, he doesn’t see a hole or cleft in the wall, not even one big enough for a cat to slip out. He thinks, ‘Whatever sizable creatures enter or leave the citadel, all of them do so via this gate.’ </p>
<p id="sn47.12:6.8">In the same way, I understand this by inference from the teaching: ‘All the perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas—whether past, future, or present—give up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Their mind is firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They correctly develop the seven awakening factors. And they wake up to the supreme perfect awakening.’” </p>
<p id="sn47.12:7.1">“Good, good, Sāriputta! So Sāriputta, you should frequently speak this exposition of the teaching to the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. Though there will be some foolish people who have doubt or uncertainty regarding the Realized One, when they hear this exposition of the teaching they’ll give up that doubt or uncertainty.” </p>

<p id="sn47.10:1.1">Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the nuns’ quarters, and sat down on the seat spread out. Then several nuns went up to Venerable Ānanda bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="sn47.10:2.1">“Honorable Ānanda, several nuns meditate with their minds firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They have realized a higher distinction than they had before.” </p>
<p id="sn47.10:2.2">“That’s how it is, sisters! That’s how it is, sisters! Any monk or nun who meditates with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation can expect to realize a higher distinction than they had before.” </p>
<p id="sn47.10:3.1">Then Ānanda educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired those nuns with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. Then Ānanda wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. </p>
<p id="sn47.10:5.1">“That’s so true, Ānanda! That’s so true! Any monk or nun who meditates with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation can expect to realize a higher distinction than they had before. </p>
<p id="sn47.10:6.1">What four? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. As they meditate observing an aspect of the body, based on the body there arises physical tension, or mental sluggishness, or the mind is externally scattered. That mendicant should direct their mind towards an inspiring foundation. As they do so, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, one feels bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. Then they reflect: ‘I have accomplished the goal for which I directed my mind. Let me now pull back.’ They pull back, and neither place the mind nor keep it connected. They understand: ‘I’m neither placing the mind nor keeping it connected. Mindful within myself, I’m happy.’ </p>
<p id="sn47.10:7.1">Furthermore, a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. As they meditate observing an aspect of principles, based on principles there arises physical tension, or mental sluggishness, or the mind is externally scattered. That mendicant should direct their mind towards an inspiring foundation. As they do so, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, one feels bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. Then they reflect: ‘I have accomplished the goal for which I directed my mind. Let me now pull back.’ They pull back, and neither place the mind nor keep it connected. They understand: ‘I’m neither placing the mind nor keeping it connected. Mindful within myself, I’m happy.’ That’s how there is directed development. </p>
<p id="sn47.10:8.1">And how is there undirected development? Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’ And they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’ And they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’ Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’ And they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’ And they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’ Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’ And they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’ And they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’ Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’ And they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’ And they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’ That’s how there is undirected development. </p>
<p id="sn47.10:9.1">So, Ānanda, I’ve taught you directed development and undirected development. Out of compassion, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples. Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, Ānanda! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction to you.” </p>

<p id="sn47.9:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the little village of Beluva. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, please enter the rainy season residence with whatever friends or acquaintances you have around Vesālī. I’ll commence the rainy season residence right here in the little village of Beluva.” </p>
<p id="sn47.9:1.6">“Yes, sir,” those mendicants replied. They did as the Buddha said, while the Buddha commenced the rainy season residence right there in the little village of Beluva. </p>
<p id="sn47.9:2.1">After the Buddha had commenced the rainy season residence, he fell severely ill, struck by dreadful pains, close to death. But he endured unbothered, with mindfulness and situational awareness. Then it occurred to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="sn47.9:2.4">“It would not be appropriate for me to become fully extinguished before informing my attendants and taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha. Why don’t I forcefully suppress this illness, stabilize the life force, and live on?” So that is what he did. Then the Buddha’s illness died down. </p>
<p id="sn47.9:3.1">Soon after the Buddha had recovered from that sickness, he left his dwelling and sat in the shade of the porch on the seat spread out. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="sn47.9:3.3">“Sir, it’s fantastic that the Buddha is comfortable, that he’s well, and that he’s alright. Because when the Buddha was sick, my body felt like it was drugged. I was disorientated, and the teachings didn’t spring to mind. Still, at least I was consoled by the thought that the Buddha won’t become fully extinguished without bringing something up regarding the Saṅgha of mendicants.” </p>
<p id="sn47.9:4.1">“But what could the mendicant Saṅgha expect from me now, Ānanda? I’ve taught the Dhamma without making any distinction between secret and public teachings. The Realized One doesn’t have the closed fist of a teacher when it comes to the teachings. </p>
<p id="sn47.9:4.4">If there’s anyone who thinks: ‘I shall lead the mendicant Saṅgha,’ or ‘the Saṅgha of mendicants is meant for me,’ let them bring something up regarding the Saṅgha. But the Realized One doesn’t think like this, so why should he bring something up regarding the Saṅgha? </p>
<p id="sn47.9:4.9">Now I am old, elderly and senior. I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life. I’m currently eighty years old. Just as a decrepit old cart keeps going by relying on straps, in the same way, the Realized One’s body keeps going as if it were relying on straps. </p>
<p id="sn47.9:5.1">Sometimes the Realized One, not focusing on any signs, and with the cessation of certain feelings, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart. Only then does the Realized One’s body become more comfortable. </p>
<p id="sn47.9:5.2">So Ānanda, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge. </p>
<p id="sn47.9:6.1">And how does a mendicant do this? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. That’s how a mendicant lives as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how the teaching is their island and their refuge, with no other refuge. </p>
<p id="sn47.9:6.7">Whether now or after I have passed, any who shall live as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the teaching as their island and their refuge, with no other refuge—those mendicants of mine who want to train shall be among the best of the best.” </p>

Thinking to free both hands and foot, he grabs it with his other foot. He gets stuck there. Thinking to free both hands and feet, he grabs it with his snout. He gets stuck there. </p>
<p id="sn47.7:2.12">And so the monkey, trapped at five points, just lies there screeching. He’d meet with tragedy and disaster, and the hunter can do what he wants with him. The hunter spears him, pries him off that tarred block of wood, and goes wherever he wants. </p>

<p id="sn47.6:1.1">“Once upon a time, mendicants, a hawk suddenly swooped down and grabbed a quail. And as the quail was being carried off he wailed, ‘I’m so unlucky, so unfortunate, to have roamed out of my territory into the domain of others. If today I’d roamed within my own territory, the domain of my fathers, this hawk wouldn’t have been able to beat me by fighting.’ </p>
<p id="sn47.6:1.5">‘So, quail, what is your own territory, the domain of your fathers?’ </p>
<p id="sn47.6:1.6">‘It’s a ploughed field covered with clods of earth.’ </p>
<p id="sn47.6:1.7">Confident in her own strength, the hawk was not daunted or intimidated. She released the quail, saying, ‘Go now, quail. But even there you won’t escape me!’ </p>
<p id="sn47.6:2.1">Then the quail went to a ploughed field covered with clods of earth. He climbed up a big clod, and standing there, he said to the hawk: ‘Come get me, hawk! Come get me, hawk!’ </p>
<p id="sn47.6:2.3">Confident in her own strength, the hawk was not daunted or intimidated. She folded her wings and suddenly swooped down on the quail. When the quail knew that the hawk was nearly there, he slipped under that clod. But the hawk crashed chest-first right there. </p>
<p id="sn47.6:2.6">That’s what happens when you roam out of your territory into the domain of others. </p>

Meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, at one, with minds that are clear, immersed in samādhi, and unified, so as to truly know feelings. Meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, at one, with minds that are clear, immersed in samādhi, and unified, so as to truly know the mind.

<p id="sn47.3:1.2">Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.” </p>
<p id="sn47.3:1.4">“This is exactly how some foolish people ask me for something. But when the teaching has been explained they think only of following me around.” </p>
<p id="sn47.3:1.5">“Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief! May the Holy One teach me the Dhamma in brief! Hopefully I can understand the meaning of what the Buddha says! Hopefully I can be an heir of the Buddha’s teaching!” </p>
<p id="sn47.3:1.6">“Well then, mendicant, you should purify the starting point of skillful qualities. What is the starting point of skillful qualities? Well purified ethics and correct view. When your ethics are well purified and your view is correct, you should develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation in three ways, depending on and grounded on ethics. </p>
<p id="sn47.3:2.1">What four? </p>
<p id="sn47.3:2.2">Meditate observing an aspect of the body internally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. Or meditate observing an aspect of the body externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. Or meditate observing an aspect of the body internally and externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. </p>
<p id="sn47.3:2.5">Or meditate observing an aspect of feelings internally … externally … internally and externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. </p>

When you develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation in these three ways, depending on and grounded on ethics, you can expect growth, not decline, in skillful qualities, whether by day or by night.” </p>
<p id="sn47.3:3.1">And then that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. </p>
<p id="sn47.3:3.2">Then that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="sn47.3:3.3">He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And that mendicant became one of the perfected. </p>

<p id="sn46.54:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where they have a town called Haliddavasana. Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Haliddavasana for alms. Then it occurred to them, “It’s too early to wander for alms in Haliddavasana. Why don’t we go to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions?” </p>
<p id="sn46.54:2.1">Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them: </p>
<p id="sn46.54:3.1">“Reverends, the ascetic Gotama teaches his disciples like this: ‘Come, mendicants, give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom, and meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Meditate spreading a heart full of compassion to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of compassion to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of rejoicing to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.’ </p>
<p id="sn46.54:4.1">We too teach our disciples in just the same way. What, then, is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching and instruction and ours?” </p>
<p id="sn46.54:5.1">Those mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers of other religions. They got up from their seat, thinking: </p>
<p id="sn46.54:5.3">“We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.” Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. </p>
<p id="sn46.54:11.1">“Mendicants, when wanderers of other religions say this, you should say to them: ‘But reverends, how is the heart’s release by love developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and culmination? How is the heart’s release by compassion developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? How is the heart’s release by rejoicing developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? How is the heart’s release by equanimity developed?

<p id="sn46.54:12.1">And how is the heart’s release by love developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? It’s when a mendicant develops the heart’s release by love together with the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive,’ that’s what they do. If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive,’ that’s what they do. If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. If they wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. The apex of the heart’s release by love is the beautiful, I say, for a mendicant who has not penetrated to a higher freedom. </p>

It’s when a mendicant develops the heart’s release by compassion together with the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. … If they wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. Or else, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space. The apex of the heart’s release by compassion is the dimension of infinite space, I say, for a mendicant who has not penetrated to a higher freedom. </p>
<p id="sn46.54:14.1">And how is the heart’s release by rejoicing developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? It’s when a mendicant develops the heart’s release by rejoicing together with the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. … If they wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. Or else, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness. The apex of the heart’s release by rejoicing is the dimension of infinite consciousness, I say, for a mendicant who has not penetrated to a higher freedom. </p>
<p id="sn46.54:15.1">And how is the heart’s release by equanimity developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? It’s when a mendicant develops the heart’s release by equanimity together with the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.

Or else, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness.

For when I was still a layman, I wasn’t helped much by the teaching or the Saṅgha. But when I considered my love and respect for the Buddha, and my sense of conscience and prudence, I went forth from the lay life to homelessness. The Buddha taught me the Dhamma: ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling … Such is perception … Such are choices … Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ </p>

I comprehended the teaching; I acquired the path. When developed and cultivated as I’m living in such a way, it will bring me to such a state that I will understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ </p>

<p id="sn46.6:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāketa in the deer park at the Añjana Wood. Then the wanderer Kuṇḍaliya went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="sn46.6:1.4">“Master Gotama, I like to hang around the monasteries and visit the assemblies. When I’ve finished breakfast, it’s my habit to wander from monastery to monastery, from park to park. There I see some ascetics and brahmins speaking for the sake of winning debates and finding fault. But what benefit does Master Gotama live for?” </p>
<p id="sn46.6:1.9">“The benefit the Realized One lives for, Kuṇḍaliya, is the fruit of knowledge and freedom.” </p>

<p id="sn46.6:2.7">“But what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill the three kinds of good conduct?” </p>
<p id="sn46.6:2.8">“Sense restraint. </p>
<p id="sn46.6:3.1">And Kuṇḍaliya, how is sense restraint developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the three kinds of good conduct? A mendicant sees an agreeable sight with their eye. They don’t desire it or enjoy it, and they don’t give rise to greed. Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and well freed. But if they see a disagreeable sight they’re not dismayed; their mind isn’t hardened, dejected, or full of ill will. Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and well freed. </p>
<p id="sn46.6:4.1">Furthermore, a mendicant hears an agreeable sound with the ear … smells an agreeable odor with the nose … tastes an agreeable flavor with the tongue … feels an agreeable touch with the body … knows an agreeable thought with their mind. They don’t desire it or enjoy it, and they don’t give rise to greed. Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and well freed. But if they know a disagreeable thought they’re not dismayed; their mind isn’t hardened, dejected, or full of ill will. Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and well freed. </p>
<p id="sn46.6:5.1">When a mendicant’s mind and body are steady internally, they’re well settled and well freed when it comes to both agreeable and disagreeable sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts. That’s how sense restraint is developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the three kinds of good conduct. </p>
<p id="sn46.6:6.1">And how are the three kinds of good conduct developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation? A mendicant gives up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develops good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. That’s how the three kinds of good conduct are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. </p>
<p id="sn46.6:7.1">And how are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors? A mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. That’s how the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors. </p>
<p id="sn46.6:8.1">And how are the seven awakening factors developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom? A mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. That’s how the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom.” </p>
<p id="sn46.6:9.1">When he said this, the wanderer Kuṇḍaliya said to the Buddha, “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<p id="sn45.8:3.1">And what is right view? Knowing about suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. This is called right view. </p>

They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have not arisen do arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are fulfilled by development.

They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and bitterness for the world. This is called right mindfulness. </p>

It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.

He saw the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi driving out of Sāvatthī in a splendid all-white chariot drawn by mares. The yoked horses were pure white, as were the ornaments, chariot, upholstery, reins, goad, and canopy. And his turban, robes, sandals were white, as was the chowry fanning him. </p>
<p id="sn45.4:1.5">When people saw it they exclaimed, “Wow! That’s a Brahmā vehicle! It’s a vehicle fit for Brahmā!” </p>
<p id="sn45.4:2.1">Then Ānanda wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, adding, “Sir, can you point out a Brahmā vehicle in this teaching and training?” </p>

He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. When a disciple passes away, he declares that this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there. And as for a disciple who is a supreme person, highest of people, having reached the highest point, when they pass away he also declares that this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there. </p>

He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. When a disciple passes away, he declares that this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there. And as for a disciple who is a supreme person, highest of people, having reached the highest point, when they pass away he also declares that this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there. </p>
<p id="sn44.9:4.1">This ascetic Gotama leads an order and a community, and teaches a community. He’s a well-known and famous religious founder, deemed holy by many people. When a disciple passes away, he declares that this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there. </p>
<p id="sn44.9:4.4">But as for a disciple who is a supreme person, highest of people, having reached the highest point, when they pass away he doesn’t declare that this one is reborn here, while that one is reborn there. Rather, he declares that they have cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit have made an end of suffering.’ I had doubt and uncertainty about that: ‘How on earth can I understand the ascetic Gotama’s teaching?’” </p>
<p id="sn44.9:5.1">“Vaccha, no wonder you’re doubting and uncertain. Doubt has come up in you about an uncertain matter. </p>
<p id="sn44.9:5.3">I describe rebirth for someone who grasps fuel, not for someone who doesn’t grasp fuel. It’s like a fire which only burns with fuel, not without fuel. In the same way I describe rebirth for someone who grasps fuel, not for someone who doesn’t grasp fuel.” </p>
<p id="sn44.9:6.1">“But when a flame is blown away by the wind, what does Master Gotama say is its fuel then?” </p>
<p id="sn44.9:6.2">“At such a time, I say that it’s fueled by wind. For the wind is its fuel then.” </p>
<p id="sn44.9:6.4">“But when someone who is attached has laid down this body and has not been reborn in one of the realms, what does Master Gotama say is their fuel then?” </p>

<p id="sn44.7:4.1">“Vaccha, the wanderers of other religions regard the eye like this: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’ They regard the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind like this: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’ </p>
<p id="sn44.7:4.4">That’s why, when asked, they declare one of those answers to be true. </p>
<p id="sn44.7:4.7">The Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha regards the eye like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ He regards the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind like this: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ </p>
<p id="sn44.7:4.10">That’s why, when asked, he does not declare one of those answers to be true.” </p>
<p id="sn44.7:5.1">Then the wanderer Vacchagotta got up from his seat and went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. He asked the Buddha the same questions, and received the same answers. </p>
<p id="sn44.7:8.1">He said, “It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing! How the meaning and the phrasing of the teacher and the disciple fit together and agree without contradiction when it comes to the chief matter! Just now I went to the ascetic Mahāmoggallāna and asked him about this matter. And he explained it to me with these words and phrases, just like Master Gotama. It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing! How the meaning and the phrasing of the teacher and the disciple fit together and agree without contradiction when it comes to the chief matter!” </p>

<h5 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">SN 44.2</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">With Anurādha </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Anurādhasutta</span></h5>
<p id="sn44.2:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. </p>
<p id="sn44.2:1.2">Now at that time Venerable Anurādha was staying not far from the Buddha in a wilderness hut. Then several wanderers of other religions went up to Venerable Anurādha and exchanged greetings with him. </p>
<p id="sn44.2:1.4">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him: </p>
<p id="sn44.2:1.5">“Reverend Anurādha, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them in these four ways: After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:1.7">“Reverends, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them other than these four ways: After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:1.9">When he said this, the wanderers said to him, “This mendicant must be junior, recently gone forth, or else a foolish, incompetent senior mendicant.” Then, after rebuking Venerable Anurādha by calling him “junior” and “foolish”, the wanderers got up from their seat and left. </p>
<p id="sn44.2:2.1">Soon after they had left, Anurādha thought, “If those wanderers were to inquire further, how should I answer them so as to repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should I explain in line with his teaching, so that there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:2.4">Then Venerable Anurādha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. </p>
<p id="sn44.2:3.1">“What do you think, Anurādha? Is form permanent or impermanent?” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:4.1">“Impermanent, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:5.1">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:6.1">“Suffering, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:7.1">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:8.1">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:9.1">“Is feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:10.1">“Impermanent, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:11.1">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:12.1">“Suffering, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:13.1">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:14.1">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:15.1">“So, Anurādha, you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: <em>all</em> form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ Any kind of feeling … perception … choices … consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: <em>all</em> consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ </p>
<p id="sn44.2:15.6">Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. </p>
<p id="sn44.2:15.8">They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ </p>
<p id="sn44.2:16.1">What do you think, Anurādha? Do you regard the Realized One as form?” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:16.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:16.4">“Do you regard the Realized One as feeling … perception … choices … consciousness?” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:16.11">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:16.12">“What do you think, Anurādha? Do you regard the Realized One as in form?” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:16.14">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:16.15">“Or do you regard the Realized One as distinct from form?” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:16.16">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:16.17">“Do you regard the Realized One as in feeling … or distinct from feeling … as in perception … or distinct from perception … as in choices … or distinct from choices … as in consciousness … or as distinct from consciousness?” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:16.26">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:17.1">“What do you think, Anurādha? Do you regard the Realized One as possessing form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:17.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:17.4">“What do you think, Anurādha? Do you regard the Realized One as one who is without form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:17.6">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:17.7">“In that case, Anurādha, since you don’t acknowledge the Realized One as a genuine fact in the present life, is it appropriate to declare: ‘Reverends, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them other than these four ways: After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist’?” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:17.11">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn44.2:17.12">“Good, good, Anurādha! In the past, as today, what I describe is suffering and the cessation of suffering.” </p>

<p id="sn44.1:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>
<p id="sn44.1:1.2">Now at that time the nun Khemā was wandering in the land of the Kosalans between Sāvatthī and Sāketa when she took up residence in Toraṇavatthu. Then King Pasenadi was traveling from Sāketa to Sāvatthī, and he too stayed in Toraṇavatthu for a single night. </p>
<p id="sn44.1:1.4">Then King Pasenadi addressed a man, “Please, mister, check if there’s a suitable ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavatthu to whom I can pay homage.” </p>
<p id="sn44.1:2.1">“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied that man. He searched all over Toraṇavatthu, but he couldn’t see a suitable ascetic or brahmin for the king to pay homage to. </p>
<p id="sn44.1:2.2">But he saw that the nun Khemā was staying there, so he went to the king and said to him, “Your Majesty, there’s no ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavatthu for the king to pay homage to. But there is the nun Khemā, who’s a disciple of the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. She has a good reputation as being astute, competent, clever, learned, a brilliant speaker, and eloquent. Your Majesty may pay homage to her.” </p>
<p id="sn44.1:4.1">Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the nun Khemā, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to her: </p>
<p id="sn44.1:4.2">“Ma’am, does a Realized One exist after death?” </p>
<p id="sn44.1:4.3">“Great king, this has not been declared by the Buddha.” </p>
<p id="sn44.1:4.5">“Well then, does a Realized One not exist after death?” </p>
<p id="sn44.1:4.6">“This too has not been declared by the Buddha.” </p>
<p id="sn44.1:4.8">“Well then, does a Realized One both exist and not exist after death?” </p>
<p id="sn44.1:4.9">“This has not been declared by the Buddha.” </p>
<p id="sn44.1:4.11">“Well then, does a Realized One neither exist nor not exist after death?” </p>
<p id="sn44.1:4.12">“This too has not been declared by the Buddha.” </p>
<p id="sn44.1:5.1">“Ma’am, when asked these questions, you say that this has not been declared by the Buddha. What’s the cause, what’s the reason why this has not been declared by the Buddha?” </p>
<p id="sn44.1:6.1">“Well then, great king, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. What do you think, great king? </p>
<p id="sn44.1:6.3">Is there any accountant or finger-tallier or reckoner who can count the grains of sand in the Ganges, that is, how many grains of sand there are, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of grains of sand?” </p>
<p id="sn44.1:6.5">“No, ma’am.” </p>
<p id="sn44.1:6.6">“Is there any accountant or finger-tallier or reckoner who can count the water in the ocean, that is, how many gallons of water there are, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of gallons of water?” </p>
<p id="sn44.1:6.8">“No, ma’am. Why is that? Because the ocean is deep, immeasurable, and hard to fathom.” </p>
<p id="sn44.1:6.11">“In the same way, great king, any form by which a Realized One might be described has been cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. A Realized One is freed from reckoning in terms of form. They’re deep, immeasurable, and hard to fathom, like the ocean. To say that after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist: none of these apply. </p>
<p id="sn44.1:7.1">Any feeling … perception … choices … consciousness by which a Realized One might be described has been cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. A Realized One is freed from reckoning in terms of consciousness. They’re deep, immeasurable, and hard to fathom, like the ocean. To say that after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist: none of these apply.” </p>
<p id="sn44.1:9.5">Then King Pasenadi approved and agreed with what the nun Khemā said. Then he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled her, keeping her on his right, before leaving. </p>
<p id="sn44.1:10.1">Then on a later occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. He asked the Buddha exactly the same questions he had asked the nun Khemā, and received the same answers. </p>
<p id="sn44.1:13.1">He said, “It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! How the meaning and the phrasing of the teacher and the disciple fit together and agree without contradiction when it comes to the chief matter! This one time I went to the nun Khemā and asked her about this matter. And she explained it to me with these words and phrases, just like the Buddha. It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! How the meaning and the phrasing of the teacher and the disciple fit together and agree without contradiction when it comes to the chief matter! </p>
<p id="sn44.1:13.7">Well, now, sir, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.” </p>
<p id="sn44.1:13.9">“Please, great king, go at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="sn44.1:13.10">Then King Pasenadi approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled him, keeping him on his right, before leaving. </p>

<p id="sn42.13:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where they have a town called Uttara. Then Pāṭaliya the chief went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="sn42.13:1.3">“Sir, I have heard this: ‘The ascetic Gotama knows magic.’ Do those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism? For we don’t want to misrepresent the Blessed One.” </p>
<p id="sn42.13:2.3">“Chief, those who say this repeat what I have said, and don’t misrepresent me with an untruth. Their explanation is in line with the teaching, and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism.” </p>
<p id="sn42.13:2.4">“Sir, we didn’t believe that what those ascetics and brahmins said was really true. But it seems the ascetic Gotama is a magician!” </p>
<p id="sn42.13:2.6">“Chief, does someone who says ‘I know magic’ also say ‘I am a magician’?” </p>
<p id="sn42.13:2.7">“That’s right, Blessed One! That’s right, Holy One!” </p>
<p id="sn42.13:2.8">“Well then, chief, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. </p>
<p id="sn42.13:3.1">What do you think, chief? Do you know the Koliyan officers with drooping headdresses?” </p>
<p id="sn42.13:3.3">“I know them, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn42.13:3.4">“And what’s their job?” </p>
<p id="sn42.13:3.5">“To put a stop to bandits and to deliver messages for the Koliyans.” </p>
<p id="sn42.13:3.6">“What do you think, chief? Are the Koliyan officers with drooping headdresses moral or immoral?” </p>
<p id="sn42.13:3.8">“I know that they’re immoral, of bad character, sir. They are among those in the world who are immoral and of bad character.” </p>

<p id="sn42.11:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Mallas, near the Mallian town called Uruvelakappa. Then Bhadraka the village chief went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="sn42.11:1.3">“Please, sir, teach me the origin and cessation of suffering.” </p>
<p id="sn42.11:1.4">“Chief, if I were to teach you about the origin and ending of suffering in the past, saying ‘this is how it was in the past,’ you might have doubts or uncertainties about that. If I were to teach you about the origin and ending of suffering in the future, saying ‘this is how it will be in the future,’ you might have doubts or uncertainties about that. Rather, chief, I will teach you about the origin and ending of suffering as I am sitting right here and you are sitting right there. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="sn42.11:1.10">“Yes, sir,” Bhadraka replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="sn42.11:2.1">“What do you think, chief? Are there any people here in Uruvelakappa who, if they were executed, imprisoned, fined, or condemned, it would cause you sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?” </p>

<p id="sn42.11:2.6">“What’s the cause, chief, what’s the reason why, if this was to happen to some people it could cause you sorrow, while if it happens to others it does not?” </p>
<p id="sn42.11:2.7">“The people regarding whom this would give rise to sorrow are those I desire and love. The people regarding whom this would not give rise to sorrow are those I don’t desire and love.” </p>
<p id="sn42.11:2.9">“With this present phenomenon that is seen, known, immediate, attained, and fathomed, you may infer to the past and future: ‘All the suffering that arose in the past was rooted and sourced in desire. For desire is the root of suffering. All the suffering that will arise in the future will be rooted and sourced in desire. For desire is the root of suffering.’” </p>
<p id="sn42.11:2.14">“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! How well said this was by the Buddha! ‘All the suffering that arises is rooted and sourced in desire. For desire is the root of suffering.’ </p>
<p id="sn42.11:2.18">I have a boy called Ciravāsi, who resides in a house away from here. I rise early and send someone, saying: ‘Go, my man, and check on my boy Ciravāsi.’ Until they get back I worry: ‘I hope nothing’s wrong with Ciravāsi!’” </p>

They accept and receive gold and money.” </p>
<p id="sn42.10:2.1">Now at that time the chief Maṇicūḷaka was sitting in that assembly. He said to that retinue, “Good sirs, don’t say that. Gold and money are not proper for Sakyan ascetics. They neither accept nor receive gold and money. They have set aside gems and gold, and rejected gold and money.” He was able to persuade that assembly. </p>
<p id="sn42.10:2.6">Then Maṇicūḷaka went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. He then said, “Answering this way, I trust that I repeat what the Buddha has said, and don’t misrepresent him with an untruth. I trust my explanation is in line with the teaching, and that there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism.” </p>

<p id="sn42.9:1.1">At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at Nāḷandā. There he stayed near Nāḷandā in Pāvārika’s mango grove. </p>
<p id="sn42.9:2.1">Now that was a time of famine and scarcity in Nāḷandā, with blighted crops turned to straw. At that time the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan was residing at Nāḷandā together with a large assembly of Jain ascetics. Then Asibandhaka’s son the chief, who was a disciple of the Jains, went up to the Jain Ñātika, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Jain Ñātika said to him: </p>
<p id="sn42.9:2.4">“Come, chief, refute the ascetic Gotama’s doctrine. Then you will get a good reputation: ‘Asibandhaka’s son the chief refuted the doctrine of the ascetic Gotama, so mighty and powerful!’” </p>
<p id="sn42.9:3.1">“But sir, how am I to do this?” </p>
<p id="sn42.9:3.2">“Here, brahmin, go to the ascetic Gotama and say to him: ‘Sir, don’t you in many ways praise kindness, protection, and compassion for families?’ When he’s asked this, if he answers: ‘Indeed I do, chief,’ say this to him: ‘So what exactly are you doing, wandering together with this large Saṅgha of mendicants during a time of famine and scarcity, with blighted crops turned to straw? The Buddha is practicing to annihilate, collapse, and ruin families!’ When you put this dilemma to him, the Buddha won’t be able to either spit it out or swallow it down.” </p>
<p id="sn42.9:3.9">“Yes, sir,” replied Asibandhaka’s son. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Jain Ñātika, keeping him on his right. Then he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="sn42.9:4.1">“Sir, don’t you in many ways praise kindness, protection, and compassion for families?” </p>

<p id="sn42.9:4.5">“Well, chief, I recollect ninety-one eons back but I’m not aware of any family that’s been ruined merely by offering some cooked almsfood. Rather, rich, affluent, and wealthy families—with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain—all acquired their wealth because of generosity, truth, and restraint. </p>
<p id="sn42.9:4.7">Chief, there are eight causes and reasons for the ruin of families. Their ruin stems from rulers, bandits, fire, or flood. Or their savings vanish. Or their business fails due to not applying themselves to work. Or a wastrel is born into the family who squanders and fritters away their wealth. And impermanence is the eighth. These are the eight causes and reasons for the ruin of families. </p>
<p id="sn42.9:4.10">Given that these eight reasons are found, suppose someone says this: ‘The Buddha is practicing to annihilate, collapse, and ruin families!’ Unless they give up that speech and thought, and let go of that view, they will be cast down to hell.” </p>

<p id="sn42.6:3.1">“Well then, chief, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. </p>
<p id="sn42.6:4.1">What do you think, chief? Take a person who kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, and have wrong view. And a large crowd comes together to offer up prayers and praise, circumambulating them with joined palms and saying: ‘When this person’s body breaks up, after death, may they be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm!’ What do you think, chief? Would that person be reborn in heaven because of their prayers?” </p>
<p id="sn42.6:4.7">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn42.6:5.1">“Chief, suppose a person were to throw a broad rock into a deep lake. And a large crowd was to come together to offer up prayers and praise, circumambulating it with joined palms, and saying: ‘Rise, good rock! Float, good rock! Float to shore, good rock!’ What do you think, chief? Would that broad rock rise up or float because of their prayers?” </p>
<p id="sn42.6:5.6">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn42.6:5.7">“In the same way, take a person who kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, and have wrong view. Even though a large crowd comes together to offer up prayers and praise … when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. </p>
<p id="sn42.6:6.1">What do you think, chief? Take a person who doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, or commit sexual misconduct. They don’t use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re contented, kind-hearted, and have right view. And a large crowd comes together to offer up prayers and praise, circumambulating them with joined palms and saying: ‘When this person’s body breaks up, after death, may they be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell!’ What do you think, chief? Would that person be reborn in hell because of their prayers?” </p>
<p id="sn42.6:6.7">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn42.6:7.1">“Chief, suppose a person were to sink a pot of ghee or oil into a deep lake and break it open. Its shards and chips would sink down, while the ghee or oil in it would rise up. And a large crowd was to come together to offer up prayers and praise, circumambulating it with joined palms and saying: ‘Sink, good ghee or oil! Descend, good ghee or oil! Go down, good ghee or oil!’ What do you think, chief? Would that ghee or oil sink and descend because of their prayers?” </p>
<p id="sn42.6:7.6">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn42.6:8.1">“In the same way, take a person who doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, or commit sexual misconduct. They don’t use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re contented, kind-hearted, and have right view. Even though a large crowd comes together to offer up prayers and praise … when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.” </p>
<p id="sn42.6:8.4">When he said this, Asibandhaka’s son the chief said to the Buddha, “Excellent, sir! … From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<p id="sn42.3:1.1">Then Dustin the warrior chief went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="sn42.3:1.2">“Sir, I have heard that the warriors of the past who were teachers of teachers said: ‘Suppose a warrior, while striving and struggling in battle, is killed and finished off by his foes. When his body breaks up, after death, he’s reborn in the company of the gods of the fallen.’ What does the Buddha say about this?” </p>
<p id="sn42.3:1.5">“Enough, chief, let it be. Don’t ask me that.” </p>
<p id="sn42.3:1.6">For a second time … </p>
<p id="sn42.3:1.7">And for a third time the warrior chief said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="sn42.3:1.8">“Sir, I have heard that the warriors of the past who were teachers of teachers said: ‘Suppose a warrior, while striving and struggling in battle, is killed and finished off by his foes. When his body breaks up, after death, he’s reborn in the company of the gods of the fallen.’ What does the Buddha say about this?” </p>
<p id="sn42.3:2.1">“Clearly, chief, I’m not getting through to you when I say: ‘Enough, chief, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’ Nevertheless, I will answer you. </p>
<p id="sn42.3:2.4">When a warrior strives and struggles in battle, their mind is already low, degraded, and misdirected as they think: ‘May these sentient beings be killed, slaughtered, slain, destroyed, or annihilated!’ His foes kill him and finish him off, and when his body breaks up, after death, he’s reborn in the hell called ‘The Fallen’. </p>
<p id="sn42.3:2.8">But if you have such a view: ‘Suppose a warrior, while striving and struggling in battle, is killed and finished off by his foes. When his body breaks up, after death, he’s reborn in the company of the gods of the fallen.’ This is your wrong view. An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say: hell or the animal realm.” </p>
<p id="sn42.3:3.1">When he said this, Dustin the warrior chief cried and burst out in tears. </p>
<p id="sn42.3:3.2">“This is what I didn’t get through to you when I said: ‘Enough, chief, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’” </p>
<p id="sn42.3:3.4">“Sir, I’m not crying because of what the Buddha said. But sir, for a long time I’ve been cheated, tricked, and deceived by the warriors of the past who were teachers of teachers, who said: ‘Suppose a warrior, while striving and struggling in battle, is killed and finished off by his foes. When his body breaks up, after death, he’s reborn in the company of the gods of the fallen.’ </p>
<p id="sn42.3:3.7">Excellent, sir! Excellent! … From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<h5 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">SN 42.2</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">With Tālapuṭa </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Tālapuṭasutta</span></h5>
<p id="sn42.2:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. Then Tālapuṭa the dancing master came up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="sn42.2:1.3">“Sir, I have heard that the dancers of the past who were teachers of teachers said: ‘Suppose a dancer entertains and amuses people on a stage or at a festival with truth and lies. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of laughing gods.’ What does the Buddha say about this?” </p>
<p id="sn42.2:1.6">“Enough, chief, let it be. Don’t ask me that.” </p>
<p id="sn42.2:1.7">For a second time … </p>
<p id="sn42.2:1.12">And for a third time Tālapuṭa said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="sn42.2:1.13">“Sir, I have heard that the dancers of the past who were teachers of teachers said: ‘Suppose a dancer entertains and amuses people on a stage or at a festival with truth and lies. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of laughing gods.’ What does the Buddha say about this?” </p>
<p id="sn42.2:2.1">“Clearly, chief, I’m not getting through to you when I say: ‘Enough, chief, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’ Nevertheless, I will answer you. </p>
<p id="sn42.2:2.5">When sentient beings are still not free of greed, and are still bound by greed, a dancer in a stage or festival presents them with even more arousing things. When sentient beings are still not free of hate, and are still bound by hate, a dancer in a stage or festival presents them with even more hateful things. When sentient beings are still not free of delusion, and are still bound by delusion, a dancer in a stage or festival presents them with even more delusory things. And so, being heedless and negligent themselves, they’ve encouraged others to be heedless and negligent. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the hell called ‘Laughter’. </p>
<p id="sn42.2:2.12">But if you have such a view: ‘Suppose a dancer entertains and amuses people on a stage or at a festival with truth and lies. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of laughing gods.’ This is your wrong view. An individual with wrong view is reborn in one of two places, I say: hell or the animal realm.” </p>
<p id="sn42.2:3.1">When he said this, Tālapuṭa cried and burst out in tears. </p>
<p id="sn42.2:3.2">“This is what I didn’t get through to you when I said: ‘Enough, chief, let it be. Don’t ask me that.’” </p>
<p id="sn42.2:3.4">“Sir, I’m not crying because of what the Buddha said.

When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of laughing gods.’ </p>
<p id="sn42.2:3.7">Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” </p>
<p id="sn42.2:3.11">And the dancing master Tālapuṭa received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. Not long after his ordination, Venerable Tālapuṭa became one of the perfected. </p>

<p id="sn42.1:1.1">At Sāvatthī. </p>
<p id="sn42.1:1.2">Then the chief named Fury went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="sn42.1:1.3">“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why some people are regarded as furious, while others are regarded as sweet-natured?” </p>
<p id="sn42.1:1.5">“Take someone who hasn’t given up greed. So they get annoyed by others, and they show it. They’re regarded as furious. They haven’t given up hate. So they get annoyed by others, and they show it. They’re regarded as furious. They haven’t given up delusion. So they get annoyed by others, and they show it. They’re regarded as furious. This is the cause, this is the reason why some people are regarded as furious. </p>

<p id="sn41.10:1.1">Now at that time the householder Citta was sick, suffering, gravely ill. </p>
<p id="sn41.10:1.2">Then several deities of the parks, forests, trees, and those who haunt the herbs, grass, and big trees came together and said to Citta, “Householder, make a wish to become a wheel-turning monarch in the future!” </p>
<p id="sn41.10:2.1">When they said this, Citta said to them, “That too is impermanent! That too will pass! That too will be left behind!” </p>
<p id="sn41.10:2.3">When he said this, his friends and colleagues, relatives and family members said, “Be mindful, master! Don’t babble.” </p>
<p id="sn41.10:2.5">“What have I said that makes you say that?” </p>
<p id="sn41.10:2.7">“It’s because you said: ‘That too is impermanent! That too will pass! That too will be left behind!’” </p>
<p id="sn41.10:2.9">“Oh, well, that’s because the deities of the parks, forests, trees, and those who haunt the herbs, grass, and big trees said to me: ‘Householder, make a wish to become a wheel-turning monarch in the future!’ So I said to them: ‘That too is impermanent! That too will pass! That too will be left behind!’” </p>
<p id="sn41.10:2.13">“But what reason do they see for saying that to you?” </p>
<p id="sn41.10:2.15">“They think: ‘This householder Citta is ethical, of good character. If he makes a wish to become a wheel-turning monarch in the future, his heart’s wish will succeed because of the purity of his ethics. And then as a proper, principled king he will provide proper spirit-offerings.’ That’s the reason they see for saying to me: ‘Householder, make a wish to become a wheel-turning monarch in the future!’ So I said to them: ‘That too is impermanent! That too will pass! That too will be left behind!’” </p>
<p id="sn41.10:3.1">“Then, master, advise us!” </p>
<p id="sn41.10:3.2">“So you should train like this: </p>
<p id="sn41.10:3.3">We will have experiential confidence in the Buddha: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ </p>
<p id="sn41.10:3.5">We will have experiential confidence in the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ </p>
<p id="sn41.10:3.7">We will have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ </p>
<p id="sn41.10:3.9">And we will share without reservation all the gifts available to give in our family with those who are ethical and of good character.” </p>
<p id="sn41.10:3.10">Then, after Citta had encouraged his friends and colleagues, relatives and family members in the Buddha, the teaching, the Saṅgha, and generosity, he passed away. </p>

<h5 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">SN 41.9</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">With Kassapa, the Naked Ascetic </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Acelakassapasutta</span></h5>
<p id="sn41.9:1.1">Now at that time the naked ascetic Kassapa, an old friend of Citta in the lay life, had arrived at Macchikāsaṇḍa. </p>
<p id="sn41.9:1.2">Citta the householder heard that he had arrived. So he went up to him, and they exchanged greetings. </p>
<p id="sn41.9:1.4">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the naked ascetic Kassapa, “Honorable Kassapa, how long has it been since you went forth?” </p>
<p id="sn41.9:1.6">“It’s been thirty years, householder.” </p>
<p id="sn41.9:1.7">“But sir, in these thirty years have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease?” </p>
<p id="sn41.9:1.8">“I have no such achievement, householder, only nakedness, baldness, and pokes in the buttocks.” </p>
<p id="sn41.9:1.9">Citta said to him, “It’s incredible, it’s amazing, how well explained the teaching is. For in thirty years you have achieved no superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, no meditation at ease, only nakedness, baldness, and pokes in the buttocks.” </p>
<p id="sn41.9:2.1">“But householder, how long have you been a lay follower?” </p>
<p id="sn41.9:2.2">“It’s been thirty years, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn41.9:2.3">“But householder, in these thirty years have you achieved any superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease?” </p>
<p id="sn41.9:2.4">“How, sir, could I not? For whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. And whenever I want, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled … I enter and remain in the second absorption. And whenever I want, with the fading away of rapture … I enter and remain in the third absorption. And whenever I want, giving up pleasure and pain … I enter and remain in the fourth absorption. </p>
<p id="sn41.9:2.9">If I pass away before the Buddha, it wouldn’t be surprising if the Buddha declares of me: ‘The householder Citta is bound by no fetter that might return him to this world.’” </p>
<p id="sn41.9:2.11">When this was said, Kassapa said to Citta, “It’s incredible, it’s amazing, how well explained the teaching is. For a white-clothed layperson can achieve such a superhuman distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a meditation at ease. Householder, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training?” </p>
<p id="sn41.9:3.1">Then Citta the householder took the naked ascetic Kassapa to see the senior mendicants, and said to them: </p>
<p id="sn41.9:3.2">“Sirs, this is the naked ascetic Kassapa, who in lay life was an old friend of mine. May the senior monks give him the going forth, the ordination. I’ll make sure that he’s provided with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.” </p>
<p id="sn41.9:3.5">And the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training. Not long after his ordination, Venerable Kassapa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="sn41.9:3.7">He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable Kassapa became one of the perfected. </p>

<h5 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">SN 41.8</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">The Jain Ascetic of the Ñātika Clan </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Nigaṇṭhanāṭaputtasutta</span></h5>
<p id="sn41.8:1.1">Now at that time the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan had arrived at Macchikāsaṇḍa together with a large assembly of Jain ascetics. </p>
<p id="sn41.8:1.2">Citta the householder heard that they had arrived. Together with several lay followers, he went up to the Jain Ñātika and exchanged greetings with him. </p>
<p id="sn41.8:1.4">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The Jain Ñātika said to him, “Householder, do you have faith in the ascetic Gotama’s claim that there is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected; that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connected?” </p>
<p id="sn41.8:2.1">“Sir, in this case I don’t rely on faith in the Buddha’s claim that there is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected; that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connected.” </p>
<p id="sn41.8:2.3">When he said this, the Jain Ñātika looked up at his assembly and said, “See, good sirs, how straightforward this householder Citta is! He’s not devious or deceitful at all. To imagine that you can stop placing the mind and keeping it connected would be like imagining that you can catch the wind in a net, or dam the Ganges river with your own hand.” </p>
<p id="sn41.8:3.1">“What do you think, sir? Which is better—knowledge or faith?” </p>
<p id="sn41.8:3.3">“Knowledge is definitely better than faith, householder.” </p>
<p id="sn41.8:3.4">“Well sir, whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. And whenever I want, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled … I enter and remain in the second absorption. And whenever I want, with the fading away of rapture … I enter and remain in the third absorption. And whenever I want, giving up pleasure and pain … I enter and remain in the fourth absorption. </p>
<p id="sn41.8:3.8">And so, sir, since I know and see like this, why should I rely on faith in another ascetic or brahmin who claims that there is a state of immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected; that there is the cessation of placing the mind and keeping it connected?” </p>
<p id="sn41.8:4.1">When he said this, the Jain Ñātika looked askance at his own assembly and said, “See, good sirs, how crooked this householder Citta is! He’s so devious and deceitful!” </p>
<p id="sn41.8:5.1">“Sir, just now I understood you to say: ‘See, good sirs, how straightforward this householder Citta is! He’s not devious or deceitful at all.’ But then I understood you to say: ‘See, good sirs, how crooked this householder Citta is! He’s so devious and deceitful!’ If your first statement is true, the second is wrong. If your first statement is wrong, the second is true. </p>
<p id="sn41.8:5.7">And also, sir, these ten legitimate questions are relevant. When you understand what they mean, then, together with your assembly of Jain ascetics, you can rebut me. ‘One thing: question, summary, and answer. Two … three … four … five … six … seven … eight … nine … ten things: question, summary, and answer.’” </p>
<p id="sn41.8:5.19">Then Citta got up from his seat and left without asking the Jain Ñātika these ten legitimate questions. </p>

<p id="sn41.7:1.1">At one time Venerable Godatta was staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove. Then Citta the householder went up to Venerable Godatta, bowed, and sat down to one side. Godatta said to him: </p>
<p id="sn41.7:1.3">“Householder, the limitless release of the heart, and the release of the heart through nothingness, and the release of the heart through emptiness, and the signless release of the heart: do these things differ in both meaning and phrasing? Or do they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing?” </p>
<p id="sn41.7:1.4">“Sir, there is a way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing. But there’s also a way in which they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing. </p>
<p id="sn41.7:2.1">And what’s the way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing? </p>
<p id="sn41.7:2.2">It’s when a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion … They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing … They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. This is called the limitless release of the heart. </p>
<p id="sn41.7:3.1">And what is the release of the heart through nothingness? It’s when a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness. This is called the release of the heart through nothingness. </p>
<p id="sn41.7:4.1">And what is the release of the heart through emptiness? It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this: ‘This is empty of a self or what belongs to a self.’ This is called the release of the heart through emptiness. </p>
<p id="sn41.7:5.1">And what is the signless heart’s release? It’s when a mendicant, not focusing on any signs, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart. This is called the signless release of the heart. </p>
<p id="sn41.7:5.4">This is the way in which these things differ in both meaning and phrasing. </p>
<p id="sn41.7:6.1">And what’s the way in which they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing? </p>
<p id="sn41.7:6.2">Greed, hate, and delusion are makers of limits. A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, and obliterated them, so they are unable to arise in the future. The unshakable release of the heart is said to be the best kind of limitless release of the heart. That unshakable release of the heart is empty of greed, hate, and delusion. </p>
<p id="sn41.7:6.6">Greed is something, hate is something, and delusion is something. A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, and obliterated them, so they are unable to arise in the future. The unshakable release of the heart is said to be the best kind of release of the heart through nothingness. That unshakable release of the heart is empty of greed, hate, and delusion. </p>

<p id="sn41.6:1.1">At one time Venerable Kāmabhū was staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove. Then Citta the householder went up to Venerable Kāmabhū, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="sn41.6:1.3">“Sir, how many processes are there?” </p>
<p id="sn41.6:1.4">“Householder, there are three processes. Physical, verbal, and mental processes.” </p>
<p id="sn41.6:1.6">Saying “Good, sir,” Citta approved and agreed with what Kāmabhū said. Then he asked another question: </p>
<p id="sn41.6:1.7">“But sir, what is the physical process? What’s the verbal process? What’s the mental process?” </p>
<p id="sn41.6:1.8">“Breathing is a physical process. Placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes. Perception and feeling are mental processes.” </p>
<p id="sn41.6:2.1">Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: </p>
<p id="sn41.6:2.2">“But sir, why is breathing a physical process? Why are placing the mind and keeping it connected verbal processes? Why are perception and feeling mental processes?” </p>
<p id="sn41.6:2.3">“Breathing is physical. It’s tied up with the body, that’s why breathing is a physical process. First you place the mind and keep it connected, then you break into speech. That’s why placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes. Perception and feeling are mental. They’re tied up with the mind, that’s why perception and feeling are mental processes.” </p>
<p id="sn41.6:3.1">Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: </p>
<p id="sn41.6:3.2">“But sir, how does someone attain the cessation of perception and feeling?” </p>
<p id="sn41.6:3.3">“A mendicant who is entering such an attainment does not think: ‘I will enter the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I am entering the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I have entered the cessation of perception and feeling.’ Rather, their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a state.” </p>

<p id="sn41.6:5.1">Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: </p>
<p id="sn41.6:5.2">“What’s the difference between someone who has passed away and a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling?” </p>
<p id="sn41.6:5.3">“When someone dies, their physical, verbal, and mental processes have ceased and stilled; their vitality is spent; their warmth is dissipated; and their faculties have disintegrated. When a mendicant has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, their physical, verbal, and mental processes have ceased and stilled. But their vitality is not spent; their warmth is not dissipated; and their faculties are very clear. That’s the difference between someone who has passed away and a mendicant who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling.” </p>
<p id="sn41.6:6.1">Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: </p>

<p id="sn41.6:7.1">Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: </p>

<p id="sn41.6:8.1">Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: </p>
<p id="sn41.6:8.2">“But sir, when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, how many kinds of contact do they experience?” </p>
<p id="sn41.6:8.3">“They experience three kinds of contact: emptiness, signless, and undirected contacts.” </p>
<p id="sn41.6:9.1">Saying “Good, sir,” he asked another question: </p>

<p id="sn41.6:9.3">“Their mind slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion.” </p>

<p id="sn41.5:4.3">“Yes, householder.” </p>
<p id="sn41.5:4.4">“Well then, sir, please wait a moment while I consider the meaning of this.” Then after a short silence Citta said to Kāmabhū: </p>
<p id="sn41.5:5.1">“Sir, ‘flawless wheel’ is a term for ethics. </p>
<p id="sn41.5:5.2">‘White canopy’ is a term for freedom. </p>
<p id="sn41.5:5.3">‘One spoke’ is a term for mindfulness. </p>
<p id="sn41.5:5.4">‘Rolls on’ is a term for going forward and coming back. </p>

<p id="sn41.5:5.6">Greed, hate, and delusion are troubles. A mendicant who has ended the defilements has given these up, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, and obliterated them, so they are unable to arise in the future.

<p id="sn41.4:2.1">Then Citta served and satisfied the senior mendicants with his own hands with delicious milk-rice made with ghee.

<p id="sn41.4:3.1">Now at that time Venerable Mahaka was the most junior mendicant in that Saṅgha. Then Venerable Mahaka said to the senior venerable, “Wouldn’t it be nice, Honorable Senior, if a cool wind blew, a cloud canopy formed, and a gentle rain drizzled down?” </p>
<p id="sn41.4:4.1">“It would indeed be nice, Reverend Mahaka.” Then Mahaka used his psychic power to will that a cool wind would blow, a cloud canopy would form, and a gentle rain would drizzle down. </p>
<p id="sn41.4:4.3">Then Citta thought, “The most junior mendicant in this Saṅgha has such psychic power!” </p>

<p id="sn41.4:5.4">“Yes, sir,” replied Citta, and did as he was asked. </p>
<p id="sn41.4:5.5">Mahaka entered his dwelling and latched the door. Then he used his psychic power to will that a flame shoot out through the keyhole and the chink in the door, and it burned up the grass but not the upper robe. Then Citta shook out his upper robe and stood to one side, shocked and awestruck. </p>
<p id="sn41.4:5.7">Mahaka left his dwelling and said to Citta, “Is that sufficient, householder?” </p>

<p id="sn41.2:4.1">Then Citta, having approved and agreed with what Isidatta said, served and satisfied the senior mendicants with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods. When the senior mendicants had eaten and washed their hands and bowls, they got up from their seats and left. </p>
<p id="sn41.2:4.3">Then the senior venerable said to Venerable Isidatta, “Isidatta, it’s good that you felt inspired to answer that question, because I didn’t. So when a similar question comes up, you should also answer it as you feel inspired.” </p>

<p id="sn41.1:1.1">At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove. Now at that time, after the meal, on return from almsround, several senior mendicants sat together in the pavilion and this discussion came up among them: </p>
<p id="sn41.1:1.3">“Reverends, the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’: do these things differ in both meaning and phrasing? Or do they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing?” </p>
<p id="sn41.1:1.4">Some senior mendicants answered like this: “Reverends, the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’: these things differ in both meaning and phrasing.” </p>
<p id="sn41.1:1.6">But some senior mendicants answered like this: “Reverends, the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’ mean the same thing; they differ only in the phrasing.” </p>
<p id="sn41.1:2.1">Now at that time the householder Citta had arrived at Migapathaka on some business. He heard about what those senior mendicants were discussing. </p>
<p id="sn41.1:3.1">So he went up to them, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to them, “Sirs, I heard that you were discussing whether the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’ differ in both meaning and phrasing, or whether they mean the same thing, and differ only in the phrasing.” </p>
<p id="sn41.1:3.7">“That’s right, householder.” </p>
<p id="sn41.1:4.1">“Sirs, the ‘fetter’ and the ‘things prone to being fettered’: these things differ in both meaning and phrasing. </p>
<p id="sn41.1:4.2">Well then, sirs, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said. </p>
<p id="sn41.1:4.4">Suppose there was a black ox and a white ox yoked by a single harness or yoke. Would it be right to say that the black ox is the yoke of the white ox, or the white ox is the yoke of the black ox?” </p>
<p id="sn41.1:4.7">“No, householder. The black ox is not the yoke of the white ox, nor is the white ox the yoke of the black ox. The yoke there is the single harness or yoke that they’re yoked by.” </p>
<p id="sn41.1:4.10">“In the same way, the eye is not the fetter of sights, nor are sights the fetter of the eye. The fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of them. </p>
<p id="sn41.1:4.12">The ear … nose … tongue … body … mind is not the fetter of thoughts, nor are thoughts the fetter of the mind. The fetter there is the desire and greed that arises from the pair of them.” </p>
<p id="sn41.1:4.19">“You’re fortunate, householder, so very fortunate, to traverse the Buddha’s deep teachings with the eye of wisdom.” </p>

<p data-counter="1" id="sn40.10:1.1">And then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared among the gods of the Thirty-Three. Then Sakka, lord of gods, with five hundred deities came up to Mahāmoggallāna, bowed, and stood to one side. Mahāmoggallāna said to him: </p>
<p id="sn40.10:2.1">“Lord of gods, it’s good to go for refuge to the Buddha. It’s the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. It’s good to go for refuge to the teaching. It’s the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. It’s good to go for refuge to the Saṅgha.

<p id="sn40.10:10.1">It’s good to have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ It’s the reason why some sentient beings, when their body breaks up, after death, are reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. </p>
<p id="sn40.10:11.1">It’s good to have the ethical conduct that’s loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.

<p id="sn40.1:1.1">At one time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants: “Reverends, mendicants!” </p>
<p id="sn40.1:1.4">“Reverend,” they replied. Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this: </p>
<p id="sn40.1:2.1">“Just now, reverends, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind: ‘They speak of this thing called the “first absorption”. What is the first absorption?’ It occurred to me: ‘It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. This is called the first absorption.’ </p>

<p id="sn36.21:2.1">“Sīvaka, some feelings stem from bile disorders. You can know this from your own personal experience, and it is generally deemed to be true.

<p id="sn36.19:5.1">“Ānanda, the explanation by the mendicant Udāyī, which the master builder Pañcakaṅga didn’t agree with, was quite correct. But the explanation by Pañcakaṅga, which Udāyī didn’t agree with, was also quite correct. </p>

<p id="sn36.19:6.1">There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation. What five? Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. … Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.

Because there is another pleasure that is finer than that. </p>
<p id="sn36.19:7.1">And what is that pleasure?

It’s when a mendicant—going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity—aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space.

<p id="sn36.11:1.1">Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="sn36.11:1.2">“Just now, sir, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind. The Buddha has spoken of three feelings. Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling. These are the three feelings the Buddha has spoken of. </p>
<p id="sn36.11:1.6">But the Buddha has also said: ‘Suffering includes whatever is felt.’ What was the Buddha referring to when he said this?” </p>
<p id="sn36.11:2.1">“Good, good, mendicant! I have spoken of these three feelings. Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling. These are the three feelings I have spoken of. </p>
<p id="sn36.11:2.5">But I have also said: ‘Suffering includes whatever is felt.’ </p>
<p id="sn36.11:2.7">When I said this I was referring to the impermanence of conditions, to the fact that conditions are liable to end, vanish, fade away, cease, and perish. </p>
<p id="sn36.11:2.15">But I have also explained the progressive cessation of conditions. For someone who has attained the first absorption, speech has ceased. For someone who has attained the second absorption, the placing of the mind and keeping it connected have ceased. For someone who has attained the third absorption, rapture has ceased. For someone who has attained the fourth absorption, breathing has ceased. For someone who has attained the dimension of infinite space, the perception of form has ceased. For someone who has attained the dimension of infinite consciousness, the perception of the dimension of infinite space has ceased. For someone who has attained the dimension of nothingness, the perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness has ceased. For someone who has attained the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, the perception of the dimension of nothingness has ceased. For someone who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have ceased. For a mendicant who has ended the defilements, greed, hate, and delusion have ceased. </p>
<p id="sn36.11:2.26">And I have also explained the progressive stilling of conditions. For someone who has attained the first absorption, speech has stilled. For someone who has attained the second absorption, the placing of the mind and keeping it connected have stilled. … For someone who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have stilled. For a mendicant who has ended the defilements, greed, hate, and delusion have stilled. </p>
<p id="sn36.11:2.31">There are these six levels of tranquility. For someone who has attained the first absorption, speech has been tranquilized. For someone who has attained the second absorption, the placing of the mind and keeping it connected have been tranquilized. For someone who has attained the third absorption, rapture has been tranquilized. For someone who has attained the fourth absorption, breathing has been tranquilized. For someone who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have been tranquilized. For a mendicant who has ended the defilements, greed, hate, and delusion have been tranquilized.” </p>

<p id="sn36.8:5.1">While a mendicant is meditating like this—mindful, aware, diligent, keen, and resolute—if pleasant feelings arise, they understand: ‘A pleasant feeling has arisen in me. That’s dependent, not independent. Dependent on what? Dependent on this very contact. But this contact is impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated. So how could a pleasant feeling be permanent, since it has arisen dependent on contact that is impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated?’ They meditate observing impermanence, vanishing, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in contact and pleasant feeling.

<h5 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">SN 35.248</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">The Sheaf of Barley </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Yavakalāpisutta</span></h5>
<p id="sn35.248:1.1">“Mendicants, suppose a sheaf of barley was placed at a crossroads. Then six people would come along carrying flails, and started threshing the sheaf of barley. So that sheaf of barley would be thoroughly threshed by those six flails. Then a seventh person would come along carrying a flail, and they’d give the sheaf of barley a seventh threshing. So that sheaf of barley would be even more thoroughly threshed by that seventh flail. </p>
<p id="sn35.248:1.8">In the same way, an unlearned ordinary person is struck in the eye by both pleasant and unpleasant sights. They’re struck in the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind by both pleasant and unpleasant thoughts. And if that unlearned ordinary person has intentions regarding rebirth into a new state of existence in the future, that foolish person is even more thoroughly struck, like that sheaf of barley threshed by the seventh person. </p>
<p id="sn35.248:2.1">Once upon a time, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons. Then Vepacitti, lord of demons, addressed the demons, ‘My good sirs, if the demons defeat the gods in this battle, bind Sakka, the lord of gods, by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the citadel of the demons.’ </p>
<p id="sn35.248:2.4">Meanwhile, Sakka, lord of gods, addressed the gods of the Thirty-Three, ‘My good sirs, if the gods defeat the demons in this battle, bind Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and bring him to my presence in the Hall of Justice of the gods.’ </p>
<p id="sn35.248:2.6">In that battle the gods won and the demons lost. So the gods of the Thirty-Three bound Vepacitti by his limbs and neck and brought him to Sakka’s presence in the Hall of Justice of the gods. </p>
<p id="sn35.248:2.8">And there Vepacitti remained bound by his limbs and neck. That is, until he thought, ‘It’s the gods who are principled, while the demons are unprincipled. Now I belong right here in the castle of the gods.’ Then he found himself freed from the bonds on his limbs and neck. He entertained himself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation. </p>
<p id="sn35.248:2.12">But when he thought, ‘It’s the demons who are principled, while the gods are unprincipled. Now I will go over there to the citadel of the demons,’ he found himself bound by his limbs and neck, and the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation disappeared. </p>
<p id="sn35.248:2.15">That’s how subtly Vepacitti was bound. But the bonds of Māra are even more subtle than that. When you identify, you’re bound by Māra. Not identifying, you’re free from the Wicked One. </p>
<p id="sn35.248:3.1">These are all forms of identifying: ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will be non-percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient.’ Conceit is a disease, a boil, a dart. So mendicants, you should train yourselves like this: ‘We will live with a heart that does not identify.’ </p>
<p id="sn35.248:4.1">These are all disturbances: ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will be non-percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient.’ Disturbances are a disease, a boil, a dart. So mendicants, you should train yourselves like this: ‘We will live with a heart free of disturbances.’ </p>
<p id="sn35.248:5.1">These are all tremblings: ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will be non-percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient.’ Trembling is a disease, a boil, a dart. So mendicants, you should train yourselves like this: ‘We will live with a heart free of tremblings.’ </p>
<p id="sn35.248:6.1">These are all proliferations: ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will be non-percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient.’ Proliferation is a disease, a boil, a dart. So mendicants, you should train yourselves like this: ‘We will live with a heart free of proliferation.’ </p>
<p id="sn35.248:7.1">These are all conceits: ‘I am’, ‘I am this’, ‘I will be’, ‘I will not be’, ‘I will have form’, ‘I will be formless’, ‘I will be percipient’, ‘I will be non-percipient’, ‘I will be neither percipient nor non-percipient.’ Conceit is a disease, a boil, a dart. So mendicants, you should train yourselves like this: ‘We will live with a heart that has struck down conceit.’” </p>

<p id="sn35.247:1.1">“Mendicants, suppose a person with wounded and festering limbs was to enter a thicket of thorny reeds. The kusa thorns would pierce their feet, and the reed leaves would scratch their limbs. And that would cause that person to experience even more pain and distress. </p>
<p id="sn35.247:1.4">In the same way, some mendicant goes to a village or a wilderness and gets scolded, ‘This venerable, acting like this, behaving like this, is a filthy village thorn.’ Understanding that they’re a thorn, they should understand restraint and lack of restraint. </p>
<p id="sn35.247:2.1">And how is someone unrestrained? </p>
<p id="sn35.247:2.2">Take a mendicant who sees a sight with their eyes. If it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and their heart restricted. And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. </p>
<p id="sn35.247:2.4">When they hear a sound with their ears … </p>
<p id="sn35.247:2.5">When they smell an odor with their nose … </p>
<p id="sn35.247:2.6">When they taste a flavor with their tongue … </p>
<p id="sn35.247:2.7">When they feel a touch with their body … </p>
<p id="sn35.247:2.8">When they know a thought with their mind, if it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and a limited heart. And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. </p>
<p id="sn35.247:3.1">Suppose a person was to catch six animals, with diverse territories and feeding grounds, and tie them up with a strong rope. They’d catch a snake, a crocodile, a bird, a dog, a jackal, and a monkey, tie each up with a strong rope, then tie a knot in the middle and let them loose. </p>
<p id="sn35.247:3.9">Then those six animals with diverse territories and feeding grounds would each pull towards their own domain and territory. The snake would pull one way, thinking ‘I’m going into an anthill!’ The crocodile would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the water!’ The bird would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m flying into the sky!’ The dog would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the village!’ The jackal would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the charnel ground!’ The monkey would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the jungle!’ When those six animals became exhausted and worn out, the strongest of them would get their way, and they’d all have to submit to their control. </p>
<p id="sn35.247:3.12">In the same way, when a mendicant has not developed or cultivated mindfulness of the body, their eye pulls towards pleasant sights, but is put off by unpleasant sights. Their ear … nose … tongue … body … mind pulls towards pleasant thoughts, but is put off by unpleasant thoughts. </p>
<p id="sn35.247:3.14">This is how someone is unrestrained. </p>
<p id="sn35.247:4.1">And how is someone restrained? </p>
<p id="sn35.247:4.2">Take a mendicant who sees a sight with their eyes. If it’s pleasant they don’t hold on to it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart. And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. </p>
<p id="sn35.247:4.4">They hear a sound … smell an odor … taste a flavor … feel a touch … know a thought with their mind. If it’s pleasant they don’t hold on to it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart. And they truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. </p>
<p id="sn35.247:5.1">Suppose a person was to catch six animals, with diverse territories and feeding grounds, and tie them up with a strong rope. They’d catch a snake, a crocodile, a bird, a dog, a jackal, and a monkey, tie each up with a strong rope, then tether them to a strong post or pillar. </p>
<p id="sn35.247:5.9">Then those six animals with diverse territories and feeding grounds would each pull towards their own domain and territory. The snake would pull one way, thinking ‘I’m going into an anthill!’ The crocodile would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the water!’ The bird would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m flying into the sky!’ The dog would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the village!’ The jackal would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the charnel ground!’ The monkey would pull another way, thinking ‘I’m going into the jungle!’ When those six animals became exhausted and worn out, they’d stand or sit or lie down right by that post or pillar. </p>
<p id="sn35.247:5.12">In the same way, when a mendicant has developed and cultivated mindfulness of the body, their eye doesn’t pull towards pleasant sights, and isn’t put off by unpleasant sights. Their ear … nose … tongue … body … mind doesn’t pull towards pleasant thoughts, and isn’t put off by unpleasant thoughts. This is how someone is restrained. </p>
<p id="sn35.247:6.1">‘A strong post or pillar’ is a term for mindfulness of the body. </p>
<p id="sn35.247:6.2">So you should train like this: ‘We will develop mindfulness of the body. We’ll cultivate it, make it our vehicle and our basis, keep it up, consolidate it, and properly implement it.’ That’s how you should train.” </p>

<p id="sn35.246:1.1">“Mendicants, any monk or nun who has desire or greed or hate or delusion or repulsion come up for sights known by the eye should shield their mind from them: ‘This path is dangerous and perilous, thorny and tangled; it’s a wrong turn, a bad path, a harmful way. This path is frequented by bad people, not by good people. It’s not worthy of you.’ The mind should be shielded from this when it comes to sights known by the eye. </p>
<p id="sn35.246:1.6">Any monk or nun who has desire or greed or hate or delusion or repulsion come up for sounds … smells … tastes … touches … thoughts known by the mind should shield their mind against them: ‘This path is dangerous and perilous, thorny and tangled; it’s a wrong turn, a bad path, a harmful way. This path is frequented by bad people, not by good people. It’s not worthy of you.’ The mind should be shielded from this when it comes to thoughts known by the mind. </p>
<p id="sn35.246:2.1">Suppose the crops have ripened, but the caretaker is negligent. If an ox fond of crops invades the crops they’d indulge themselves as much as they like. </p>
<p id="sn35.246:2.3">In the same way, when an unlearned ordinary person doesn’t exercise restraint when it comes to the six fields of contact, they indulge themselves in the five kinds of sensual stimulation as much as they like. </p>
<p id="sn35.246:3.1">Suppose the crops have ripened, and the caretaker is diligent. If an ox fond of crops invades the crops the caretaker would grab them firmly by the muzzle. Then they’d grab them above the hump and hold them fast there. Then they’d give them a good thrashing before driving them away. For a second time, and even a third time, the same thing might happen. As a result, no matter how long they stand or sit in a village or wilderness, that ox fond of crops would never invade that crop again, remembering the beating they got earlier. </p>
<p id="sn35.246:3.14">In the same way, when a mendicant’s mind is subdued, well subdued when it comes to the six fields of contact, becomes stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in samādhi. </p>
<p id="sn35.246:4.1">Suppose a king or their minister had never heard the sound of an arched harp. When he first hears the sound, he’d say, ‘My man, what is making this sound, so arousing, sensuous, intoxicating, infatuating, and captivating?’ </p>
<p id="sn35.246:4.5">They’d say to him, ‘That, sir, is an arched harp.’ </p>
<p id="sn35.246:4.7">He’d say, ‘Go, my man, fetch me that arched harp.’ </p>
<p id="sn35.246:4.9">So they’d fetch it and say, ‘This, sir, is that arched harp.’ </p>
<p id="sn35.246:4.12">He’d say, ‘I’ve had enough of that arched harp! Just fetch me the sound.’ </p>
<p id="sn35.246:4.14">They’d say, ‘Sir, this arched harp is made of many components assembled together, which make a sound when they’re played. That is, it depends on the body, the skin, the neck, the head, the strings, the plectrum, and a person to play it properly. That’s how an arched harp is made of many components assembled together, which make a sound when they’re played.’ </p>
<p id="sn35.246:4.19">But he’d split that harp into ten pieces or a hundred pieces, then splinter it up. He’d burn the splinters with fire, and reduce them to ashes. Then he’d sweep away the ashes in a strong wind, or float them away down a swift stream. </p>
<p id="sn35.246:4.22">Then he’d say, ‘It seems that there’s nothing to this thing called an arched harp or whatever’s called an arched harp! But people waste their time with it, negligent and heedless!’ </p>
<p id="sn35.246:4.24">In the same way, a mendicant searches for form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness anywhere they might be reborn. As they search in this way, their thoughts of ‘I’ or ‘mine’ or ‘I am’ are no more.” </p>

<p id="sn35.243:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Now at that time a new town hall had recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all. </p>
<p id="sn35.243:1.3">Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, a new town hall has recently been constructed for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu. It has not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all. May the Buddha be the first to use it, and only then will the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu use it. That would be for the lasting welfare and happiness of the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu.” The Buddha consented with silence. </p>
<p id="sn35.243:2.1">Knowing that the Buddha had consented, the Sakyans got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went to the new town hall, where they spread carpets all over, prepared seats, set up a water jar, and placed a lamp. Then they went back to the Buddha and told him of their preparations, saying, “Please, sir, come at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="sn35.243:2.4">Then the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the new town hall together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Having washed his feet he entered the town hall and sat against the central column facing east. The Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the west wall facing east, with the Buddha right in front of them. The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the Buddha right in front of them. The Buddha spent much of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the Sakyans with a Dhamma talk. Then he dismissed them, saying, “The night is getting late, Gotamas. Please go at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="sn35.243:2.10">“Yes, sir,” replied the Sakyans. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving. </p>
<p id="sn35.243:3.1">And then, soon after the Sakyans had left, the Buddha addressed Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, “Moggallāna, the Saṅgha of mendicants is rid of dullness and drowsiness. Give them some Dhamma talk as you feel inspired. My back is sore, I’ll stretch it.” </p>
<p id="sn35.243:3.6">“Yes, sir,” Mahāmoggallāna replied. And then the Buddha spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. </p>
<p id="sn35.243:3.8">There Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants: “Reverends, mendicants!” </p>
<p id="sn35.243:3.10">“Reverend,” they replied. Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this: </p>
<p id="sn35.243:3.12">“I will teach you the explanation of the corrupt and the uncorrupted. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="sn35.243:3.14">“Yes, reverend,” they replied. Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this: </p>
<p id="sn35.243:4.1">“And how is someone corrupt? </p>
<p id="sn35.243:4.2">Take a mendicant who sees a sight with the eye. If it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body unestablished and their heart restricted. And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. </p>

And they don’t truly understand the freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom where those arisen bad, unskillful qualities cease without anything left over. </p>
<p id="sn35.243:4.7">This is called a mendicant who is corrupt when it comes to sights known by the eye, sounds … smells … tastes … touches … thoughts known by the mind. </p>
<p id="sn35.243:4.10">When a mendicant lives like this, if Māra comes at them through the eye he finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them. If Māra comes at them through the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind he finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them. </p>
<p id="sn35.243:5.1">Suppose there was a house made of reeds or straw that was dried up, withered, and decrepit. If a person came to it with a burning grass torch from the east, west, north, south, below, above, or from anywhere, the fire would find a vulnerability, it would get a foothold. </p>
<p id="sn35.243:5.9">In the same way, when a mendicant lives like this, if Māra comes at them through the eye he finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them. If Māra comes at them through the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind he finds a vulnerability and gets hold of them. </p>
<p id="sn35.243:5.12">When a mendicant lives like this, they’re mastered by sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts, they don’t master these things. </p>
<p id="sn35.243:5.18">This is called a mendicant who has been mastered by sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts. They’re mastered, not a master. Bad, unskillful qualities have mastered them, which are corrupting, leading to future lives, hurtful, and resulting in suffering and future rebirth, old age, and death. </p>

<p id="sn35.243:7.1">Suppose there was a bungalow or hall made of thick clay with its plaster still wet. If a person came to it with a burning grass torch from the east, west, north, south, below, above, or from anywhere, the fire wouldn’t find a vulnerability, it would get no foothold. </p>

<p id="sn35.243:7.18">That’s how someone is uncorrupted.” </p>
<p id="sn35.243:8.1">Then the Buddha got up and said to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna: </p>
<p id="sn35.243:8.2">“Good, good, Moggallāna! It’s good that you’ve taught this explanation of the corrupt and the uncorrupted.” </p>
<p id="sn35.243:9.1">This is what Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said, and the teacher approved. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what Mahāmoggallāna said. </p>

<p id="sn35.241:1.5">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn35.241:1.6">“Mendicants, assume that that tree trunk doesn’t collide with the near shore or the far shore, or sink in the middle, or get stranded on high ground. And assume that it doesn’t get taken by humans or non-humans or caught up in a whirlpool, and that it doesn’t rot away. In that case, that tree trunk will slant, slope, and incline towards the ocean.

Why is that? Because right view slants, slopes, and inclines towards extinguishment.” </p>
<p id="sn35.241:2.6">When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha: </p>
<p id="sn35.241:2.7">“But sir, what’s the near shore and what’s the far shore? What’s sinking in the middle? What’s getting stranded on high ground? What’s getting taken by humans or non-humans? What’s getting caught up in a whirlpool? And what’s rotting away?” </p>

It’s when someone leads the spiritual life wishing to be reborn in one of the orders of gods: ‘By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life, may I become one of the gods!’ That’s called getting taken by non-humans. ‘Caught up in a whirlpool’ is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulation. </p>

<p id="sn35.240:1.1">“Once upon a time, mendicants, a tortoise was grazing along the bank of a river in the afternoon. At the same time, a jackal was also hunting along the river bank. The tortoise saw the jackal off in the distance hunting, so it drew its limbs and neck inside its shell, and kept passive and silent. </p>
<p id="sn35.240:1.5">But the jackal also saw the tortoise off in the distance grazing. So it went up to the tortoise and waiting nearby, thinking, ‘When that tortoise sticks one or other of its limbs or neck out from its shell, I’ll grab it right there, rip it out, and eat it!’ </p>
<p id="sn35.240:1.8">But when that tortoise didn’t stick one or other of its limbs or neck out from its shell, the jackal left disappointed, since it couldn’t find a vulnerability. </p>
<p id="sn35.240:2.1">In the same way, Māra the Wicked is always waiting nearby, thinking: ‘Hopefully I can find a vulnerability in the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind.’ That’s why you should live with sense doors guarded. </p>
<p id="sn35.240:2.6">When you see a sight with your eyes, don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and bitterness would become overwhelming. For this reason, practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint. </p>

<p id="sn35.235:12.1">Forget sleeping! I’d better focus on the fact that the mind, thoughts, mind consciousness, and mind contact are impermanent. And the painful, pleasant, or neutral feeling that arises conditioned by mind contact is also impermanent.’ </p>
<p id="sn35.235:13.1">Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye, sights, eye consciousness, and eye contact.

<p id="sn35.133:1.1">At one time Venerable Udāyī was staying near Kāmaṇḍā in the brahmin Todeyya’s mango grove. </p>
<p id="sn35.133:1.2">Then a boy who was a student of the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan went up to Udāyī and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. Udāyī educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired that student with a Dhamma talk. </p>
<p id="sn35.133:1.5">Then that student went to the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan and said to her, “Please, madam, you should know this. The ascetic Udāyī teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.” </p>
<p id="sn35.133:2.1">“Then, student, invite him in my name for tomorrow’s meal.” </p>
<p id="sn35.133:2.2">“Yes, madam,” he replied. He went to Udāyī and said, “Sir, might Master Udāyī please accept an offering of tomorrow’s meal from my teacher’s wife, the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan.” Udāyī consented with silence. </p>
<p id="sn35.133:2.5">Then when the night had passed, Udāyī robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the brahmin lady’s home, and sat down on the seat spread out. Then the brahmin lady served and satisfied Udāyī with her own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods. </p>
<p id="sn35.133:2.7">When Udāyī had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, she put on a pair of shoes, sat on a high seat, covered her head, and said to him, “Ascetic, preach the Dhamma.” </p>
<p id="sn35.133:2.9">“There will be an occasion for that, sister,” he replied, then got up from his seat and left. </p>
<p id="sn35.133:3.1">For a second time that student went to Venerable Udāyī … </p>
<p id="sn35.133:3.4">And for a second time that student went to the brahmin lady of the Verahaccāni clan … </p>
<p id="sn35.133:4.1">She said to him, “You keep praising the ascetic Udāyī like this. But when I asked him to preach the Dhamma he just said that there would be an occasion for that, and then he got up and left.” </p>
<p id="sn35.133:4.3">“Madam, that’s because you put on a pair of shoes, sat on a high seat, and covered your head before inviting him to teach. For the masters respect the teaching.” </p>
<p id="sn35.133:4.6">“Then, student, invite him in my name for tomorrow’s meal.” </p>
<p id="sn35.133:4.7">“Yes, madam,” he replied. … </p>
<p id="sn35.133:5.1">Then the brahmin lady served and satisfied Udāyī with her own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods. </p>
<p id="sn35.133:5.3">When Udāyī had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, she took off her shoes, sat on a low seat, uncovered her head, and said to him, “Sir, when what exists do the perfected ones declare that there is pleasure and pain? When what doesn’t exist do the perfected ones not declare that there is pleasure and pain?” </p>
<p id="sn35.133:6.1">“Sister, when there’s an eye, the perfected ones declare that there is pleasure and pain. When there’s no eye, the perfected ones don’t declare that there is pleasure and pain. When there’s an ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, the perfected ones declare that there is pleasure and pain. When there’s no mind, the perfected ones don’t declare that there is pleasure and pain.” </p>
<p id="sn35.133:7.1">When he said this, the brahmin lady said to Udāyī, “Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Venerable Udāyī has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Venerable Udāyī remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<p id="sn35.132:1.1">At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying in the land of the Avantis in a wilderness hut near Makkarakaṭa. </p>
<p id="sn35.132:1.2">Then several youths, students of the brahmin Lohicca, approached Mahākaccāna’s wilderness hut while collecting firewood. They walked and wandered all around the hut, making a dreadful racket and all kinds of jeers: “These shavelings, fake ascetics, primitives, black spawn from the feet of our kinsman, the Lord! They’re honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed by those who pretend to inherit Vedic culture.” </p>
<p id="sn35.132:1.4">And then Mahākaccāna left his dwelling and said to those brahmin students, “Students, stop being so noisy. I will speak to you on the teaching.” </p>
<p id="sn35.132:1.7">When this was said, the students fell silent. Then Mahākaccāna recited these verses for them. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn35.132:2.1">“The brahmins of old championed ethics <br/>and remembered the ancient traditions. <br/>Their sense doors were guarded, well protected, <br/>and they had mastered anger. </p>
<p id="sn35.132:3.1">Those brahmins who remembered <j>the ancient traditions </j><br/>enjoyed virtue and absorption. </p>
<p id="sn35.132:4.1">But these have lost their way. Claiming to recite, <br/>they live out of balance, <j>judging everyone by their clan. </j><br/>Mastered by anger, they take up many arms, <br/>attacking both the strong and the weak. </p>
<p id="sn35.132:5.1">All is vain for someone <j>who doesn’t guard the sense doors, </j><br/>like the wealth a person finds in a dream. <br/>Fasting, sleeping on bare ground, <br/>bathing at dawn, the three Vedas, </p>

<p id="sn35.132:7.1">A mind that’s serene, <br/>clear and undisturbed, <br/>kind to all creatures: <br/>that’s the path to attainment of Brahmā!” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="sn35.132:8.1">Then those students, offended and upset, went to the brahmin Lohicca and said to him, “Please, master, you should know this. The ascetic Mahākaccāna condemns and rejects outright the hymns of the brahmins!” </p>
<p id="sn35.132:8.3">When they said this, Lohicca was offended and upset. Then he thought, “But it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to abuse or insult the ascetic Mahākaccāna solely because of what I’ve heard from these students. Why don’t I go and ask him about it?” </p>
<p id="sn35.132:9.1">Then the brahmin Lohicca together with those students went to Venerable Mahākaccāna and exchanged greetings with him. </p>
<p id="sn35.132:9.2">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him, “Master Kaccāna, did several young students of mine come by here collecting firewood?” </p>
<p id="sn35.132:9.4">“They did, brahmin.” </p>
<p id="sn35.132:9.5">“But did you have some discussion with them?” </p>
<p id="sn35.132:9.6">“I did.” </p>
<p id="sn35.132:9.7">“But what kind of discussion did you have with them?” </p>
<p id="sn35.132:9.8">“This is the discussion I had with these students.” And he repeated the verses in full. </p>
<p id="sn35.132:12.1">“Master Kaccāna spoke of someone who doesn’t guard the sense doors. How do you define someone who doesn’t guard the sense doors?” </p>
<p id="sn35.132:12.3">“Brahmin, take someone who sees a sight with their eyes. If it’s pleasant they hold on to it, but if it’s unpleasant they dislike it.

<p id="sn35.121:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>
<p id="sn35.121:1.2">Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, “The qualities that ripen in freedom have ripened in Rāhula. Why don’t I lead him further to the ending of defilements?” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:1.5">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Rāhula, “Rāhula, get your sitting cloth. Let’s go to the Dark Forest for the day’s meditation.” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:1.9">“Yes, sir,” replied Rāhula. Taking his sitting cloth he followed behind the Buddha. </p>
<p id="sn35.121:2.1">Now at that time many thousands of deities followed the Buddha, thinking, “Today the Buddha will lead Rāhula further to the ending of defilements!” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:2.3">Then the Buddha plunged deep into the Dark Forest and sat at the root of a tree on the seat spread out. Rāhula bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: </p>
<p id="sn35.121:3.1">“What do you think, Rāhula? Is the eye permanent or impermanent?” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:4.1">“Impermanent, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:5.1">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:6.1">“Suffering, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:7.1">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:8.1">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:9.1">“Are sights … eye consciousness … eye contact permanent or impermanent?” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:14.1">“Impermanent, sir.” … </p>
<p id="sn35.121:15.1">“Anything included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that arises conditioned by eye contact: is that permanent or impermanent?” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:16.1">“Impermanent, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:17.1">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:18.1">“Suffering, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:19.1">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:20.1">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:21.1">“Is the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind permanent or impermanent?” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:34.1">“Impermanent, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:35.1">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:36.1">“Suffering, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:37.1">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:38.1">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:39.1">“Are thoughts … mind consciousness … mind contact permanent or impermanent?” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:44.1">“Impermanent, sir.” … </p>
<p id="sn35.121:45.1">“Anything included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that arises conditioned by mind contact: is that permanent or impermanent?” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:46.1">“Impermanent, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:47.1">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:48.1">“Suffering, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:49.1">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:50.1">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:51.1">“Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye, sights, eye consciousness, and eye contact. And they become disillusioned with anything included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that arises conditioned by eye contact. </p>
<p id="sn35.121:51.2">They grow disillusioned with the ear … nose … tongue … body … </p>
<p id="sn35.121:52.1">They grow disillusioned with the mind, thoughts, mind consciousness, and mind contact. And they grow disillusioned with anything included in feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that arises conditioned by mind contact. </p>
<p id="sn35.121:52.2">Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. </p>
<p id="sn35.121:52.3">They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’” </p>
<p id="sn35.121:53.1">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, Venerable Rāhula was happy with what the Buddha said. And while this discourse was being spoken, Rāhula’s mind was freed from defilements by not grasping. </p>
<p id="sn35.121:53.4">And the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in those thousands of deities: </p>
<p id="sn35.121:53.5">“Everything that has a beginning has an end.” </p>

<p id="sn35.120:1.1">At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then a certain mendicant went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him. </p>
<p id="sn35.120:1.3">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and said to him, “Reverend Sāriputta, a mendicant pupil of mine has resigned the training and returned to a lesser life.” </p>
<p id="sn35.120:2.1">“That’s how it is, reverend, when someone doesn’t guard the sense doors, eats too much, and is not committed to wakefulness. It’s not possible for such a mendicant to maintain the full and pure spiritual life for the rest of their life. But it is possible for a mendicant to maintain the full and pure spiritual life for the rest of their life if they guard the sense doors, eat in moderation, and are committed to wakefulness. </p>
<p id="sn35.120:3.1">And how does someone guard the sense doors? When a mendicant sees a sight with the eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and bitterness would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint. When they hear a sound with their ears … When they smell an odor with their nose … When they taste a flavor with their tongue … When they feel a touch with their body … When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and bitterness would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint. That’s how someone guards the sense doors. </p>
<p id="sn35.120:4.1">And how does someone eat in moderation? It’s when a mendicant reflects properly on the food that they eat: ‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’ That’s how someone eats in moderation. </p>
<p id="sn35.120:5.1">And how is someone committed to wakefulness? It’s when a mendicant practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying their mind from obstacles. In the evening, they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation. In the middle of the night, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. In the last part of the night, they get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying their mind from obstacles. That’s how someone is committed to wakefulness. </p>
<p id="sn35.120:5.7">So you should train like this: ‘We will guard the sense doors, eat in moderation, and be committed to wakefulness.’ That’s how you should train.” </p>

<p id="sn35.117:1.1">“Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought: ‘My mind might often stray towards the five kinds of sensual stimulation that I formerly experienced—which have passed, ceased, and perished—or to those in the present, or in the future a little.’ </p>

<p id="sn35.87:3.1">“Reverend Sāriputta, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading. The winds piercing my head are so severe, it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp point. The pain in my head is so severe, it feels like a strong man tightening a tough leather strap around my head. The winds slicing my belly are so severe, like a deft butcher or their apprentice were slicing open a cows’s belly open with a meat cleaver. The burning in my body is so severe, it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals. I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading. </p>
<p id="sn35.87:3.10">Reverend Sāriputta, I will slit my wrists. I don’t wish to live.” </p>

<p id="sn35.87:5.7">Moreover, for a long time now I have served the Teacher with love, not without love. For it is proper for a disciple to serve the Teacher with love, not without love. You should remember this: ‘The mendicant Channa will slit his wrists blamelessly.’” </p>

<p id="sn35.87:6.2">“Ask, Reverend Sāriputta. When I’ve heard it I’ll know.” </p>
<p id="sn35.87:7.1">“Reverend Channa, do you regard the eye, eye consciousness, and things knowable by eye consciousness in this way: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’? </p>
<p id="sn35.87:7.2">Do you regard the ear … nose … tongue … body … mind, mind consciousness, and things knowable by mind consciousness in this way: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” </p>

<p id="sn35.87:9.1">“Reverend Channa, what have you seen, what have you directly known in these things that you regard them in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self’?” </p>
<p id="sn35.87:10.1">“Reverend Sāriputta, after seeing cessation, after directly knowing cessation in these things I regard them in this way: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self’.” </p>
<p id="sn35.87:11.1">When he said this, Venerable Mahācunda said to Venerable Channa, “So, Reverend Channa, you should pay close attention to this instruction of the Buddha whenever you can: </p>
<p id="sn35.87:11.3">‘For the dependent there is agitation. For the independent there’s no agitation. When there’s no agitation there is tranquility. When there’s tranquility there’s no inclination. When there’s no inclination, there’s no coming and going. When there’s no coming and going, there’s no passing away and reappearing. When there’s no passing away and reappearing, there’s no this world or world beyond or between the two. Just this is the end of suffering.’” </p>
<p id="sn35.87:12.1">And when the venerables Sāriputta and Mahācunda had given Venerable Channa this advice they got up from their seat and left. Not long after those venerables had left, Venerable Channa slit his wrists. </p>
<p id="sn35.87:13.1">Then Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, Venerable Channa has slit his wrists. Where has he been reborn in his next life?” </p>
<p id="sn35.87:13.4">“Sāriputta, didn’t the mendicant Channa declare his blamelessness to you personally?” </p>
<p id="sn35.87:13.5">“Sir, there is a Vajjian village named Pubbavijjhana where Channa had families with whom he was friendly, intimate, and familiar.” </p>
<p id="sn35.87:13.7">“The mendicant Channa did indeed have such families, Sāriputta. But this is not enough for me to call someone ‘blameworthy’. When someone lays down this body and takes up another body, I call them ‘blameworthy’. But the mendicant Channa did no such thing. </p>

<p id="sn35.64:2.1">“Migajāla, there are sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. If a mendicant approves, welcomes, and keep clinging to them, this gives rise to relishing. Relishing is the origin of suffering, I say. </p>

<p id="sn35.64:4.2">Then Migajāla, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="sn35.64:4.3">He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Migajāla became one of the perfected. </p>

A mendicant who lives like this is said to live alone, even if they live within a village crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their ministers, and monastics of other religions and their disciples. Why is that? For craving is their partner, and they have given it up. That’s why they’re said to live alone.” </p>

<p id="sn28.10:1.1">At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. Then he robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms. After wandering indiscriminately for almsfood in Rājagaha, he ate his almsfood by a wall. </p>
<p id="sn28.10:1.4">Then the wanderer Sucimukhī went up to Venerable Sāriputta and said to him: </p>
<p id="sn28.10:2.1">“Ascetic, do you eat facing downwards?” </p>
<p id="sn28.10:2.2">“No, sister.” </p>
<p id="sn28.10:2.3">“Well then, do you eat facing upwards?” </p>

<p id="sn28.10:3.1">“When asked if you eat facing all these directions, you answer ‘no, sister’. How exactly do you eat, ascetic?” </p>
<p id="sn28.10:4.2">“Sister, those ascetics and brahmins who earn a living by geomancy—a low lore, a wrong livelihood—are said to eat facing downwards. </p>
<p id="sn28.10:4.3">Those ascetics and brahmins who earn a living by astrology—a low lore, a wrong livelihood—are said to eat facing upwards. </p>
<p id="sn28.10:4.4">Those ascetics and brahmins who earn a living by running errands and messages—a wrong livelihood—are said to eat facing the cardinal directions. </p>

<p id="sn28.10:5.1">I don’t earn a living by any of these means. I seek alms in a principled manner, and I eat it in a principled manner.” </p>
<p id="sn28.10:6.1">Then Sucimukhī the wanderer went around Rājagaha from street to street and from square to square, and announced: “The Sakyan ascetics eat food in a principled manner! The Sakyan ascetics eat food blamelessly! Give almsfood to the Sakyan ascetics!” </p>

<p id="sn25.1:1.1">At Sāvatthī. </p>
<p id="sn25.1:1.2">“Mendicants, the eye is impermanent, decaying, and perishing. The ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind are impermanent, decaying, and perishing. </p>
<p id="sn25.1:1.8">Someone who has faith and confidence in these principles is called a follower by faith. They’ve arrived at inevitability regarding the right path, they’ve arrived at the level of the good person, and they’ve transcended the level of the bad person. They can’t do any deed which would make them be reborn in hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm. They can’t die without realizing the fruit of stream-entry. </p>
<p id="sn25.1:2.1">Someone who accepts these principles after considering them with a degree of wisdom is called a follower of the teachings. They’ve arrived at inevitability regarding the right path, they’ve arrived at the level of the good person, and they’ve transcended the level of the bad person.

They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain to each other. What seven? The substances of earth, water, fire, air; pleasure, pain, and the soul is the seventh. These seven substances are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or both pleasure and pain to each other. If you chop off someone’s head with a sharp sword, you don’t take anyone’s life. The sword simply passes through the gap between the seven substances. There are 1.4 million main wombs, and 6,000, and 600. There are 500 deeds, and five, and three. There are deeds and half-deeds. There are 62 paths, 62 sub-eons, six classes of rebirth, and eight stages in a person’s life. There are 4,900 Ājīvaka ascetics, 4,900 wanderers, and 4,900 naked ascetics. There are 2,000 faculties, 3,000 hells, and 36 realms of dust. There are seven percipient embryos, seven non-percipient embryos, and seven embryos without attachments. There are seven gods, seven humans, and seven goblins. There are seven lakes, seven winds, seven cliffs, and 700 cliffs. There are seven dreams and 700 dreams. There are 8.4 million great eons through which the foolish and the astute transmigrate before making an end of suffering. And here there is no such thing as this: “By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life I shall force unripened deeds to bear their fruit, or eliminate old deeds by experiencing their results little by little”—for that cannot be. Pleasure and pain are allotted. Transmigration lasts only for a limited period, so there’s no increase or decrease, no getting better or worse. It’s like how, when you toss a ball of string, it rolls away unraveling. In the same way, after transmigrating the foolish and the astute will make an end of suffering’?” </p>

Because that chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated. </p>
<p id="sn22.101:5.9">In the same way, when a mendicant is committed to development, they might not wish: ‘If only my mind was freed from the defilements by not grasping!’ Even so, their mind is freed from defilements by not grasping. Why is that? You should say: ‘It’s because they are developed.’ Developed in what? Developed in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path. </p>

They just know what has been worn away. Suppose there was a sea-faring ship bound together with ropes. For six months they deteriorated in the water. Then in the cold season it was hauled up on dry land, where the ropes were weathered by wind and sun. When the clouds soaked it with rain, the ropes would readily collapse and rot away. In the same way, when a mendicant is committed to development their fetters readily collapse and rot away.” </p>

I had 84,000 palaces, with the palace named Principle the foremost. I had 84,000 chambers, with the great foyer the foremost. I had 84,000 couches made of ivory or heartwood or gold or silver, spread with woolen covers—shag-piled or embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red pillows at both ends. I had 84,000 bull elephants with gold adornments and banners, covered with gold netting, with the royal bull elephant named Sabbath the foremost. I had 84,000 horses with gold adornments and banners, covered with gold netting, with the royal steed named Thundercloud the foremost. I had 84,000 chariots with gold adornments and banners, covered with gold netting, with the chariot named Triumph the foremost. I had 84,000 jewels, with the jewel-treasure the foremost. I had 84,000 women, with Queen Subhaddā the foremost. I had 84,000 aristocrat vassals, with the counselor-treasure the foremost. I had 84,000 milk cows with silken reins and bronze pails. I had 8,400,000,000 fine cloths of linen, cotton, silk, and wool. I had 84,000 servings of food, which were presented to me as offerings in the morning and evening. </p>
<p id="sn22.96:4.1">Of those 84,000 cities, I only stayed in one, the capital Kusāvatī. Of those 84,000 mansions, I only dwelt in one, the Palace of Principle. Of those 84,000 chambers, I only dwelt in the great foyer. Of those 84,000 couches, I only used one, made of ivory or heartwood or gold or silver.

Of those 84,000 chariots, I only rode one, the chariot named Triumph. Of those 84,000 women, I was only served by one, a maiden of the aristocratic or peasant classes. Of those 8,400,000,000 cloths, I only wore one pair, made of fine linen, cotton, silk, and wool.

<p id="sn22.95:2.1">“Mendicants, suppose this Ganges river was carrying along a big lump of foam. And a person with good eyesight would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully. And it would appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in a lump of foam? </p>
<p id="sn22.95:2.2">In the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; near or far—examining it carefully.

<p id="sn22.95:3.1">Suppose it was the time of autumn, when the rain was falling heavily, and a bubble on the water forms and pops right away.

For what substance could there be in a water bubble? </p>
<p id="sn22.95:3.2">In the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of feeling at all … examining it carefully. And it appears to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in feeling? </p>
<p id="sn22.95:4.1">Suppose that in the last month of summer, at noon, a shimmering mirage appears. And a person with good eyesight would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully. And it would appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in a mirage? </p>
<p id="sn22.95:4.2">In the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of perception at all … examining it carefully. And it appears to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in perception? </p>
<p id="sn22.95:5.1">Suppose there was a person in need of heartwood. Wandering in search of heartwood, they’d take a sharp axe and enter a forest. There they’d see a big banana tree, straight and young and grown free of defects. They’d cut it down at the base, cut off the top, and unroll the coiled sheaths. But they wouldn’t even find sapwood, much less heartwood. And a person with good eyesight would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully. And it would appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in a banana tree? </p>
<p id="sn22.95:5.2">In the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of choices at all … examining them carefully. And they appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in choices? </p>

<p id="sn22.95:7.1">Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’” </p>

<p id="sn22.91:1.1">At Sāvatthī. </p>
<p id="sn22.91:1.2">Then Venerable Rāhula went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="sn22.91:1.3">“Sir, how does one know and see so that there’s no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli?” </p>
<p id="sn22.91:2.1">“Rāhula, one truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: <em>all</em> form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ </p>

<h5 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">SN 22.90</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">With Channa </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Channasutta</span></h5>
<p id="sn22.90:1.1">At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana. </p>
<p id="sn22.90:1.2">Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Channa came out of retreat. Taking a key, he went from dwelling to dwelling, going up to the senior mendicants and saying, “May the venerable senior mendicants advise me and instruct me! May they give me a Dhamma talk so that I can see the teaching!” </p>
<p id="sn22.90:2.1">When he said this, the senior mendicants said to Venerable Channa: </p>
<p id="sn22.90:2.2">“Reverend Channa, form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent. Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self. All conditions are impermanent. All things are not-self.” </p>
<p id="sn22.90:3.1">Then Venerable Channa thought, “I too think in this way. … And yet my mind isn’t eager, confident, settled, and decided about the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment. Anxiety and grasping arise. And the mind reverts to thinking: ‘So then who exactly is my self?’ But that doesn’t happen for someone who sees the teaching. Who can teach me the Dhamma so that I can see the teaching?” </p>
<p id="sn22.90:4.1">Then Venerable Channa thought, “The Venerable Ānanda is staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery. He’s praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions. He’s quite capable of teaching me the Dhamma so that I can see the teaching. Since I have so much trust in Venerable Ānanda, why don’t I go to see him?” </p>
<p id="sn22.90:4.5">Then Channa set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Kosambī. He went to see Ānanda in Ghosita’s Monastery, exchanged greetings with him, and told him what had happened. Then he said, </p>
<p id="sn22.90:7.1">“May Venerable Ānanda advise me and instruct me! May he give me a Dhamma talk so that I can see the teaching!” </p>
<p id="sn22.90:8.1">“I’m already delighted with Venerable Channa. Hopefully you’ve opened yourself up and cut through your emotional barrenness. Listen well, Channa. You are capable of understanding the teaching.” </p>
<p id="sn22.90:8.4">Then right away Channa was filled with lofty rapture and joy, “It seems I’m capable of understanding the teaching!” </p>
<p id="sn22.90:9.1">“Reverend Channa, I heard and learned in the presence of the Buddha his advice to the mendicant Kaccānagotta: </p>
<p id="sn22.90:9.2">‘Kaccāna, this world mostly relies on the dual notions of existence and non-existence. </p>
<p id="sn22.90:9.3">But when you truly see the origin of the world with right understanding, you won’t have the notion of non-existence regarding the world. And when you truly see the cessation of the world with right understanding, you won’t have the notion of existence regarding the world. </p>
<p id="sn22.90:9.5">The world is for the most part shackled by attraction, grasping, and insisting. </p>
<p id="sn22.90:9.6">But if—when it comes to this attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendency—you don’t get attracted, grasp, and commit to the notion “my self”, you’ll have no doubt or uncertainty that what arises is just suffering arising, and what ceases is just suffering ceasing. Your knowledge about this is independent of others. </p>
<p id="sn22.90:9.9">This is how right view is defined. </p>
<p id="sn22.90:9.10">“All exists”: this is one extreme. </p>
<p id="sn22.90:9.11">“All does not exist”: this is the second extreme. </p>
<p id="sn22.90:9.12">Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way: </p>
<p id="sn22.90:9.13">“Ignorance is a condition for choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. </p>
<p id="sn22.90:9.16">When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.”’” </p>
<p id="sn22.90:10.1">“Reverend Ānanda, this is how it is when you have such venerables as spiritual companions to advise and instruct you out of kindness and compassion. And now that I’ve heard this teaching from Venerable Ānanda, I’ve comprehended the teaching.” </p>

<p id="sn22.89:1.1">At one time several senior mendicants were staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. Now at that time Venerable Khemaka was staying in the Jujube Tree Monastery, and he was sick, suffering, gravely ill. </p>
<p id="sn22.89:1.3">In the late afternoon those senior mendicants came out of retreat and addressed Venerable Dāsaka, “Please, Reverend Dāsaka, go to the mendicant Khemaka and say to him: ‘Reverend Khemaka, the seniors hope you’re keeping well; they hope you’re alright. They hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.’” </p>
<p id="sn22.89:1.7">“Yes, reverends,” replied Dāsaka. He went to Khemaka and said to him: </p>
<p id="sn22.89:1.8">“Reverend Khemaka, the seniors hope you’re keeping well; they hope you’re alright. They hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.” </p>
<p id="sn22.89:1.10">“Reverend, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. My pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.” </p>
<p id="sn22.89:2.1">Then Dāsaka went to those seniors and told them what had happened. They said, </p>
<p id="sn22.89:2.4">“Please, Reverend Dāsaka, go to the mendicant Khemaka and say to him: ‘Reverend Khemaka, the seniors say that these five grasping aggregates have been taught by the Buddha, that is: the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Do you regard anything among these five grasping aggregates as self or as belonging to self?’” </p>
<p id="sn22.89:3.1">“Yes, reverends,” replied Dāsaka. He relayed the message to Khemaka, who replied: </p>
<p id="sn22.89:3.6">“These five grasping aggregates have been taught by the Buddha, that is: the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. I do not regard anything among these five grasping aggregates as self or as belonging to self.” </p>
<p id="sn22.89:4.1">Then Dāsaka went to those seniors and told them what had happened. They said: </p>
<p id="sn22.89:4.6">“Please, Reverend Dāsaka, go to the mendicant Khemaka and say to him: ‘Reverend Khemaka, the seniors say that these five grasping aggregates have been taught by the Buddha, that is: the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. If, as it seems, Venerable Khemaka does not regard anything among these five grasping aggregates as self or as belonging to self, then he is a perfected one, with defilements ended.’” </p>
<p id="sn22.89:5.1">“Yes, reverends,” replied Dāsaka. He relayed the message to Khemaka, who replied: </p>
<p id="sn22.89:5.6">“These five grasping aggregates have been taught by the Buddha, that is: the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. I do not regard anything among these five grasping aggregates as self or as belonging to self, yet I am not a perfected one, with defilements ended. For when it comes to the five grasping aggregates I’m not rid of the conceit ‘I am’. But I don’t regard anything as ‘I am this’.” </p>
<p id="sn22.89:6.1">Then Dāsaka went to those seniors and told them what had happened. They said: </p>
<p id="sn22.89:7.1">“Please, Reverend Dāsaka, go to the mendicant Khemaka and say to him: ‘Reverend Khemaka, the seniors ask, when you say “I am”, what is it that you’re talking about? Is it form or apart from form? Is it feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, or apart from consciousness? When you say “I am”, what is it that you’re talking about?” </p>
<p id="sn22.89:8.1">“Yes, reverends,” replied Dāsaka. He relayed the message to Khemaka, who replied: </p>
<p id="sn22.89:8.10">“Enough, Reverend Dāsaka! What’s the point in running back and forth? Bring my staff, I’ll go to see the senior mendicants myself.” </p>
<p id="sn22.89:9.1">Then Venerable Khemaka, leaning on a staff, went to those senior mendicants and exchanged greetings with them. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. They said to him: </p>
<p id="sn22.89:9.3">“Reverend Khemaka, when you say ‘I am’, what is it that you’re talking about? Is it form or apart from form? Is it feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, or apart from consciousness? When you say ‘I am’, what is it that you’re talking about?” </p>
<p id="sn22.89:9.10">“Reverends, I don’t say ‘I am’ with reference to form, or apart from form. I don’t say ‘I am’ with reference to feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, or apart from consciousness. For when it comes to the five grasping aggregates I’m not rid of the conceit ‘I am’. But I don’t regard anything as ‘I am this’. </p>
<p id="sn22.89:10.1">It’s like the scent of a blue water lily, or a pink or white lotus. Would it be right to say that the scent belongs to the petals or the stalk or the pistil?” </p>
<p id="sn22.89:10.3">“No, reverend.” </p>
<p id="sn22.89:10.4">“Then, reverends, how should it be said?” </p>
<p id="sn22.89:10.5">“It would be right to say that the scent belongs to the flower.” </p>
<p id="sn22.89:10.6">“In the same way, reverends, I don’t say ‘I am’ with reference to form, or apart from form. I don’t say ‘I am’ with reference to feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, or apart from consciousness. For when it comes to the five grasping aggregates I’m not rid of the conceit ‘I am’. But I don’t regard anything as ‘I am this’. </p>
<p id="sn22.89:11.1">Although a noble disciple has given up the five lower fetters, they still have a lingering residue of the conceit ‘I am’, the desire ‘I am’, and the underlying tendency ‘I am’ which has not been eradicated. After some time they meditate observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates. ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling … Such is perception … Such are choices … Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ As they do so, that lingering residue is eradicated. </p>
<p id="sn22.89:12.1">Suppose there was a cloth that was dirty and soiled, so the owners give it to a launderer. The launderer kneads it thoroughly with salt, lye, and cow dung, and rinses it in clear water. Although that cloth is clean and bright, it still has a lingering scent of salt, lye, or cow dung that had not been eradicated. The launderer returns it to its owners, who store it in a fragrant casket. And that lingering scent would be eradicated. </p>
<p id="sn22.89:12.6">In the same way, although a noble disciple has given up the five lower fetters, they still have a lingering residue of the conceit ‘I am’, the desire ‘I am’, and the underlying tendency ‘I am’ which has not been eradicated.

Such is feeling … Such is perception … Such are choices … Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ As they do so, that lingering residue is eradicated.” </p>
<p id="sn22.89:13.1">When he said this, the senior mendicants said to Venerable Khemaka, “We didn’t want to trouble Venerable Khemaka with our questions. But you’re capable of explaining, teaching, asserting, establishing, clarifying, analyzing, and revealing the Buddha’s instructions in detail. And that’s just what you’ve done.” </p>
<p id="sn22.89:14.1">That’s what Venerable Khemaka said. Satisfied, the senior mendicants were happy with what Venerable Khemaka said. And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of sixty senior mendicants and of Venerable Khemaka were freed from defilements by not grasping. </p>

<p id="sn22.88:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. Now at that time Venerable Assaji was staying in a monastery built by a Kassapa, and he was sick, suffering, gravely ill. Then he addressed his carers: </p>
<p id="sn22.88:1.4">“Please, reverends, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him: ‘Sir, the mendicant Assaji is sick, suffering, gravely ill. He bows with his head to your feet.’ And then say: ‘Sir, please go to the mendicant Assaji out of compassion.’” </p>
<p id="sn22.88:1.9">“Yes, reverend,” those monks replied. They did as he asked. The Buddha consented with silence. </p>
<p id="sn22.88:2.1">Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to Venerable Assaji. Venerable Assaji saw the Buddha coming off in the distance, and tried to rise on his cot. </p>
<p id="sn22.88:2.4">But the Buddha said to him, “It’s all right, Assaji, don’t get up. There are some seats spread out, I will sit there.” </p>
<p id="sn22.88:2.7">He sat on the seat spread out and said, “I hope you’re keeping well, Assaji; I hope you’re alright. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.” </p>
<p id="sn22.88:3.1">“Sir, I’m not all right, I’m not getting by. My pain is terrible and growing, not fading, its growing is evident, not its fading.” </p>
<p id="sn22.88:3.2">“I hope you don’t have any remorse or regret?” </p>
<p id="sn22.88:3.3">“Indeed, sir, I have no little remorse and regret.” </p>
<p id="sn22.88:3.4">“I hope you have no reason to blame yourself when it comes to ethical conduct?” </p>
<p id="sn22.88:3.5">“No sir, I have no reason to blame myself when it comes to ethical conduct.” </p>
<p id="sn22.88:3.6">“In that case, Assaji, why do you have remorse and regret?” </p>
<p id="sn22.88:3.7">“Sir, before my time of illness I meditated having completely stilled the physical process. But now I can’t get immersion. Since I can’t get immersion, I think: ‘May I not decline!’” </p>
<p id="sn22.88:3.10">“Assaji, there are ascetics and brahmins for whom samādhi is the essence, equating immersion with the ascetic life. They think: ‘May we not decline!’ </p>
<p id="sn22.88:4.1">What do you think, Assaji? Is form permanent or impermanent?” </p>
<p id="sn22.88:4.3">“Impermanent, sir.” … </p>
<p id="sn22.88:4.4">“Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?” … </p>
<p id="sn22.88:4.5">“So you should truly see … Seeing this … They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ </p>
<p id="sn22.88:4.8">If they feel a pleasant feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t relish it. If they feel a painful feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t relish it. If they feel a neutral feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t relish it. If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it detached. If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it detached. If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it detached. Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’ They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life is over, everything that’s felt, being no longer relished, will become cool right here.’ </p>
<p id="sn22.88:5.1">Suppose an oil lamp depended on oil and a wick to burn. As the oil and the wick are used up, it would be extinguished due to lack of fuel. </p>

<p id="sn22.87:2.14">“For a long time I’ve wanted to go and see the Buddha, but I was physically too weak.” </p>
<p id="sn22.87:3.1">“Enough, Vakkali! Why would you want to see this rotten body? One who sees the teaching sees me. One who sees me sees the teaching. Seeing the teaching, you see me. Seeing me, you see the teaching. </p>

<p id="sn22.87:4.3">“Impermanent, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn22.87:4.4">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” </p>
<p id="sn22.87:4.5">“Suffering, sir.” </p>

<p id="sn22.87:5.1">And then, after giving Venerable Vakkali this advice, the Buddha got up from his seat and went to the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. </p>
<p id="sn22.87:5.2">Then Venerable Vakkali addressed his carers, “Come on, reverends, lift my cot and take me to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili. It’s unthinkable for one like me to die in an inhabited area!” </p>
<p id="sn22.87:5.5">“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants, and did as he asked. Meanwhile, the Buddha spent the rest of that night and day on Vulture’s Peak Mountain. </p>
<p id="sn22.87:5.7">Then, late at night, two glorious deities, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. </p>
<p id="sn22.87:5.8">One deity said to him, “Sir, the mendicant Vakkali is intent on liberation!” </p>
<p id="sn22.87:5.10">And another deity said to him, “He’ll definitely be well-freed!” </p>

<p id="sn22.87:7.11">“Yes, sir,” those monks replied. They went to Vakkali and said to him: </p>
<p id="sn22.87:7.12">“Vakkali, hear the word of the Buddha and two deities.” </p>
<p id="sn22.87:8.1">Then Vakkali addressed his carers, “Please, reverends, help me off my cot. It’s unthinkable for one like me to listen to the Buddha’s instructions sitting on a high seat.” </p>
<p id="sn22.87:8.4">“Yes, reverend,” replied those mendicants, and helped him off his cot. They repeated what the Buddha had said. </p>
<p id="sn22.87:8.14">Vakkali said, “Well then, reverends, in my name bow with your head at the Buddha’s feet. Say to him: ‘Sir, the mendicant Vakkali is sick, suffering, gravely ill. He bows with his head to your feet.’ And then say: ‘Form is impermanent. I have no doubt of that. I’m certain that what is impermanent is suffering.

<p id="sn22.87:8.35">“Yes, reverend,” those monks replied, and left. And then, not long after those mendicants had left, Venerable Vakkali slit his wrists. </p>
<p id="sn22.87:9.1">Then those mendicants went up to the Buddha and told him Vakkali’s message. </p>
<p id="sn22.87:10.1">Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, “Come, mendicants, let’s go to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili, where Vakkali, the gentleman, slit his wrists.” </p>
<p id="sn22.87:10.4">“Yes, sir,” they replied. </p>
<p id="sn22.87:10.5">Then the Buddha together with several mendicants went to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili. The Buddha saw Vakkali off in the distance lying on his cot, having cast off the aggregates. </p>
<p id="sn22.87:11.1">Now at that time a cloud of black smoke was moving east, west, north, south, above, below, and in-between. </p>

<p id="sn22.86:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Now at that time Venerable Anurādha was staying not far from the Buddha in a wilderness hut. Then several wanderers of other religions went up to Venerable Anurādha and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him: </p>
<p id="sn22.86:1.5">“Reverend Anurādha, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them in these four ways: After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:2.1">When they said this, Venerable Anurādha said to those wanderers: </p>
<p id="sn22.86:2.2">“Reverends, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them other than these four ways: After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.” When he said this, the wanderers said to him: </p>
<p id="sn22.86:2.5">“This mendicant must be junior, recently gone forth, or else a foolish, incompetent senior mendicant.” Then, after rebuking Venerable Anurādha by calling him “junior” and “foolish”, the wanderers got up from their seats and left. </p>
<p id="sn22.86:3.1">Soon after they had left, Anurādha thought: </p>
<p id="sn22.86:3.2">“If those wanderers were to inquire further, how should I answer them so as to repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should I explain in line with his teaching, so that there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:4.1">Then Venerable Anurādha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him all that had happened. </p>
<p id="sn22.86:7.1">“What do you think, Anurādha? Is form permanent or impermanent?” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:7.3">“Impermanent, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:7.4">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:7.5">“Suffering, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:7.6">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:7.8">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:7.9">“Is feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:7.13">“Impermanent, sir.” … “So you should truly see … Seeing this … They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ </p>
<p id="sn22.86:8.1">What do you think, Anurādha? Do you regard the Realized One as form?” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:8.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:8.4">“Do you regard the Realized One as feeling … perception … choices … consciousness?” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:8.8">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:9.1">“What do you think, Anurādha? Do you regard the Realized One as in form?” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:9.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:9.4">“Or do you regard the Realized One as distinct from form?” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:9.5">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:9.6">“Do you regard the Realized One as in feeling … or distinct from feeling … as in perception … or distinct from perception … as in choices … or distinct from choices … as in consciousness … or as distinct from consciousness?” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:9.14">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:10.1">“What do you think, Anurādha? Do you regard the Realized One as possessing form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:10.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:11.1">“What do you think, Anurādha? Do you regard the Realized One as one who is without form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:11.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:12.1">“In that case, Anurādha, since you don’t acknowledge the Realized One as a genuine fact in the present life, is it appropriate to declare: ‘Reverends, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them other than these four ways: After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist’?” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:12.4">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn22.86:13.1">“Good, good, Anurādha! In the past, as today, I describe suffering and the cessation of suffering.” </p>

<p id="sn22.85:1.1">At one time Venerable Sāriputta was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>
<p id="sn22.85:1.2">Now at that time a mendicant called Yamaka had the following harmful misconception: “As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death.” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:2.1">Several mendicants heard about this. They went to Yamaka and exchanged greetings with him. </p>
<p id="sn22.85:2.4">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him, “Is it really true, Reverend Yamaka, that you have such a harmful misconception: ‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death’?” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:3.3">“Yes, reverends, that’s how I understand the Buddha’s teaching.” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:4.1">“Don’t say that, Yamaka! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that.” But even though admonished by those mendicants, Yamaka obstinately stuck to that misconception and insisted on stating it. </p>
<p id="sn22.85:5.1">When those mendicants were unable to dissuade Yamaka from that misconception, they got up from their seats and went to see Venerable Sāriputta. They told him what had happened, and said, “May Venerable Sāriputta please go to the mendicant Yamaka out of compassion.” Sāriputta consented with silence. </p>
<p id="sn22.85:5.6">Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Yamaka and exchanged greetings with him. Seated to one side he said to Yamaka: </p>
<p id="sn22.85:6.1">“Is it really true, Reverend Yamaka, that you have such a harmful misconception: ‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death’?” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:6.3">“Yes, reverend, that’s how I understand the Buddha’s teaching.” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:7.1">“What do you think, Yamaka? Is form permanent or impermanent?” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:7.3">“Impermanent, reverend.” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:7.4">“Is feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:7.8">“Impermanent, reverend.” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:7.9">“So you should truly see … Seeing this … They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ </p>
<p id="sn22.85:8.1">What do you think, Reverend Yamaka? Do you regard the Realized One as form?” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:8.3">“No, reverend.” </p>

<p id="sn22.85:9.5">“No, reverend.” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:9.6">“Do you regard the Realized One as in feeling … or distinct from feeling … as in perception … or distinct from perception … as in choices … or distinct from choices … as in consciousness?” </p>

<p id="sn22.85:9.14">“Or do you regard the Realized One as distinct from consciousness?” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:9.15">“No, reverend.” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:10.1">“What do you think, Yamaka? Do you regard the Realized One as possessing form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:10.3">“No, reverend.” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:11.1">“What do you think, Yamaka? Do you regard the Realized One as one who is without form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:11.3">“No, reverend.” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:11.4">“In that case, Reverend Yamaka, since you don’t acknowledge the Realized One as a genuine fact in the present life, is it appropriate to declare: ‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death.’?” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:12.1">“Reverend Sāriputta, in my ignorance, I used to have that misconception. But now that I’ve heard the teaching from Venerable Sāriputta I’ve given up that misconception, and I’ve comprehended the teaching.” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:13.1">“Reverend Yamaka, suppose they were to ask you: ‘When their body breaks up, after death, what happens to a perfected one, who has ended the defilements?’ How would you answer?” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:13.4">“Reverend, if they were to ask this, I’d answer like this: ‘Reverend, form is impermanent. What’s impermanent is suffering. What’s suffering has ceased and ended. </p>
<p id="sn22.85:13.10">Feeling … perception … choices … consciousness is impermanent. What’s impermanent is suffering. What’s suffering has ceased and ended.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:14.1">“Good, good, Reverend Yamaka! Well then, I shall give you a simile to make the meaning even clearer. Suppose there was a householder or householder’s son who was rich, with a lot of money and great wealth, and a bodyguard for protection. Then along comes a person who wants to harm, injure, and threaten him, and take his life. They’d think: ‘This householder or householder’s son is rich, with a lot of money and great wealth, and a bodyguard for protection. It won’t be easy to take his life by force. Why don’t I get close to him, then take his life?’ So he goes up to that householder or householder’s son and says: ‘Sir, I would serve you.’ Then they would serve that householder or householder’s son. They’d get up before him and go to bed after him, and be obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely. The householder or householder’s son would consider them as a friend and companion, and come to trust them. But when that person realizes that they’ve gained the trust of the householder or householder’s son, then, when they know he’s alone, they’d take his life with a sharp knife. </p>
<p id="sn22.85:15.1">What do you think, Yamaka? When that person went to the householder or householder’s son and offered to serve him, weren’t they a killer then, though he didn’t know that this was his killer? And when they got up before him and went to bed after him, being obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely, weren’t they a killer then, though he didn’t know that this was his killer? And when, knowing he was alone, they took his life with a sharp knife, weren’t they a killer then, though he didn’t know that this was his killer?” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:15.12">“Yes, reverend.” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:15.13">“In the same way, an unlearned ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons. They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They regard feeling … perception … choices … They regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. </p>
<p id="sn22.85:16.1">They don’t truly understand form—which is impermanent—as impermanent. They don’t truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is impermanent—as impermanent. </p>

<p id="sn22.85:21.1">They’re attracted to form, grasp it, and commit to the notion that it is ‘my self’. They’re attracted to feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, grasp it, and commit to the notion that it is ‘my self’. And when you’ve gotten involved with and grasped these five grasping aggregates, they lead to your lasting harm and suffering. </p>
<p id="sn22.85:22.1">A learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons. They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form.

Not being attracted to feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, they don't grasp it, and commit to the notion that it is ‘my self’. And when you’re not attracted to and don’t grasp these five grasping aggregates, they lead to your lasting welfare and happiness.” </p>
<p id="sn22.85:28.7">“Reverend Sāriputta, this is how it is when you have such venerables as spiritual companions to advise and instruct you out of kindness and compassion. And after hearing this teaching by Venerable Sāriputta, my mind is freed from the defilements by not grasping.” </p>

<p id="sn22.84:1.1">At Sāvatthī. </p>
<p id="sn22.84:1.2">Now at that time Venerable Tissa, the Buddha’s paternal cousin, informed several mendicants: </p>
<p id="sn22.84:1.3">“Reverends, my body feels like it’s drugged. I’m disorientated, the teachings don’t spring to mind, and dullness and drowsiness fill my mind. I lead the spiritual life dissatisfied, and have doubts about the teachings.” </p>
<p id="sn22.84:2.1">Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. </p>
<p id="sn22.84:3.1">So the Buddha addressed a certain monk, “Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Tissa that the Teacher summons him.” </p>
<p id="sn22.84:3.3">“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Tissa and said to him, “Reverend Tissa, the teacher summons you.” </p>
<p id="sn22.84:3.5">“Yes, reverend,” Tissa replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: </p>
<p id="sn22.84:3.6">“Is it really true, Tissa, that you informed several mendicants that your body feels like it’s drugged … and you have doubts about the teachings?” </p>
<p id="sn22.84:3.8">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn22.84:3.9">“What do you think, Tissa? If you’re not rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for form, when that form decays and perishes, will it give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?” </p>
<p id="sn22.84:3.11">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn22.84:4.1">“Good, good, Tissa! That’s how it is, Tissa, when you’re not rid of greed for form. </p>

<p id="sn22.84:9.1">Suppose, Tissa, there were two people. One was not skilled in the path, the other was. The one not skilled in the path would question the one skilled in the path, who would reply: ‘Come, good man, this is the path. Go down it a little, and you’ll see a fork in the road. Ignore the left, and take the right-hand path. Go a little further, and you’ll see a dark forest grove. Go a little further, and you’ll see an expanse of low-lying marshes. Go a little further, and you’ll see a large, steep cliff. Go a little further, and you’ll see level, cleared parkland.’ </p>
<p id="sn22.84:10.1">I’ve made up this simile to make a point. And this is what it means. </p>
<p id="sn22.84:10.3">‘A person who is not skilled in the path’ is a term for an ordinary unlearned person. </p>
<p id="sn22.84:10.4">‘A person who is skilled in the path’ is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. </p>

<p id="sn22.82:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks. </p>
<p id="sn22.82:2.1">Then one of the mendicants got up from their seat, arranged their robe over one shoulder, raised their joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: </p>
<p id="sn22.82:2.2">“Sir, I’d like to ask the Buddha about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:2.3">“Well then, mendicant, take your own seat and ask what you wish.” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:2.4">“Yes, sir,” replied that mendicant. He took his seat and said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="sn22.82:2.5">“Sir, are these the five grasping aggregates, that is: form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:3.1">“Yes, they are,” replied the Buddha. </p>
<p id="sn22.82:3.3">Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question: </p>
<p id="sn22.82:4.1">“But sir, what is the root of these five grasping aggregates?” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:4.2">“These five grasping aggregates are rooted in desire.” … “But sir, is that grasping the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates? Or is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates another?” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:4.4">“Neither. Rather, the desire and greed for them is the grasping there.” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:4.5">Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question: </p>
<p id="sn22.82:5.1">“But sir, can there be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates?” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:5.2">“There can,” said the Buddha. </p>
<p id="sn22.82:5.3">“It’s when someone thinks: ‘In the future, may I be of such form, such feeling, such perception, such choices, or such consciousness!’ That’s how there can be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates.” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:5.6">Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question: </p>
<p id="sn22.82:6.1">“Sir, what is the scope of the term ‘aggregates’ as applied to the aggregates?” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:6.2">“Any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: this is called the aggregate of form. Any kind of feeling at all … Any kind of perception at all … Any kind of choices at all … Any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: this is called the aggregate of consciousness. That’s the scope of the term ‘aggregates’ as applied to the aggregates.” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:6.8">Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question: </p>
<p id="sn22.82:7.1">“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why the aggregate of form is found? What is the cause, what is the reason why the aggregate of feeling … perception … choices … consciousness is found?” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:7.6">“The four primary elements are the reason why the aggregate of form is found. Contact is the reason why the aggregates of feeling, perception, and choices are found. Name and form are the reasons why the aggregate of consciousness is found.” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:7.11">Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question: </p>
<p id="sn22.82:8.1">“Sir, how does identity view come about?” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:8.2">“It’s because an unlearned ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons. They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They regard feeling … perception … choices … consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. That’s how identity view comes about.” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:8.9">Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant … asked another question: </p>
<p id="sn22.82:9.1">“But sir, how does identity view not come about?” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:9.2">It’s because a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons. They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They don’t regard feeling … perception … choices … consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. That’s how identity view does not come about.” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:9.9">Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant … asked another question: </p>
<p id="sn22.82:10.1">“Sir, what’s the gratification, the drawback, and the escape when it comes to form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:10.6">“The pleasure and happiness that arise from form: this is its gratification. That form is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback. Removing and giving up desire and greed for form: this is its escape. The pleasure and happiness that arise from feeling … perception … choices … consciousness: this is its gratification. That consciousness is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback. Removing and giving up desire and greed for consciousness: this is its escape.” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:10.15">Saying “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question: </p>
<p id="sn22.82:11.1">“Sir, how does one know and see so that there’s no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli?” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:11.2">“One truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: <em>all</em> form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ They truly see any kind of feeling … perception … choices … consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near, <em>all</em> consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ That’s how to know and see so that there’s no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli.” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:12.1">Now at that time one of the mendicants had the thought: </p>
<p id="sn22.82:12.2">“So it seems, good sir, that form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self. Then what self will the deeds done by not-self affect?” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:12.4">Then the Buddha, knowing what that monk was thinking, addressed the mendicants: </p>
<p id="sn22.82:13.1">“It’s possible that some foolish person here—unknowing and ignorant, their mind dominated by craving—thinks they can overstep the teacher’s instructions. They think: ‘So it seems, good sir, that form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self. Then what self will the deeds done by not-self affect?’ Now, mendicants, you have been educated by me in questioning with regards to all these things in all such cases. </p>
<p id="sn22.82:14.1">What do you think, mendicants? Is form permanent or impermanent?” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:14.3">“Impermanent, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:14.4">“Is feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:14.8">“Impermanent, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:14.9">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:14.10">“Suffering, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:14.11">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:14.13">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn22.82:14.14">“So you should truly see … Seeing this … They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’” </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn22.82:15.1">“Two on the aggregates; exactly the same; <j>and can there be; </j><br/>on the term; and on the cause; <br/>two questions on identity; <br/>gratification; and that with consciousness: <br/>these are the ten questions <br/>the mendicant came to ask.” </p>

<p id="sn22.81:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery. </p>
<p id="sn22.81:1.2">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kosambī for alms. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he set his lodgings in order himself. Taking his bowl and robe, without informing his attendants or taking leave of the mendicant Saṅgha, he set out to go wandering alone, with no companion. </p>
<p id="sn22.81:2.1">Then, not long after the Buddha had left, one of the mendicants went to Venerable Ānanda and told him what had happened. Ānanda said, “Reverend, when the Buddha leaves like this it means he wants to stay alone. At this time no-one should follow him.” </p>
<p id="sn22.81:3.1">Then the Buddha, traveling stage by stage, arrived at Pārileyya, where he stayed at the root of a sacred sal tree. Then several mendicants went up to Venerable Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him. </p>
<p id="sn22.81:3.4">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him, “Reverend, it’s been a long time since we’ve heard a Dhamma talk from the Buddha. We wish to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.” </p>
<p id="sn22.81:4.1">Then Venerable Ānanda together with those mendicants went to Pārileyya to see the Buddha. They bowed and sat down to one side, and the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk. </p>
<p id="sn22.81:4.3">Now at that time one of the monks had the thought, “How do you know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life?” </p>
<p id="sn22.81:4.5">Then the Buddha, knowing what that monk was thinking, addressed the mendicants: </p>
<p id="sn22.81:4.6">“Mendicants, I’ve taught the Dhamma analytically. I’ve analytically taught the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path. That’s how I’ve taught the Dhamma analytically. Though I’ve taught the Dhamma analytically, still a certain mendicant present here has this thought: ‘How do you know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life?’ </p>
<p id="sn22.81:5.1">And how, mendicants, do you know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life? Take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons. </p>
<p id="sn22.81:5.3">They regard form as self. But that regarding is just a conditioned phenomenon. And what’s the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of that conditioned phenomenon? When an unlearned ordinary person is struck by feelings born of contact with ignorance, craving arises. That conditioned phenomenon is born from that. So that conditioned phenomenon is impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated. And that craving, that feeling, that contact, and that ignorance are also impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated. That’s how you should know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life. </p>
<p id="sn22.81:6.1">Perhaps they don’t regard form as self, but they still regard self as possessing form. But that regarding is just a conditioned phenomenon. … </p>
<p id="sn22.81:7.1">Perhaps they don’t regard form as self, or self as possessing form, but they still regard form in self. But that regarding is just a conditioned phenomenon. … </p>
<p id="sn22.81:8.1">Perhaps they don’t regard form as self, or self as possessing form, or form in self, but they still regard self in form. But that regarding is just a conditioned phenomenon. … </p>
<p id="sn22.81:9.1">Perhaps they don’t regard form as self, or self as possessing form, or form in self, or self in form. But they regard feeling as self … perception as self … choices as self … consciousness as self … But that regarding is just a conditioned phenomenon. And what’s the source of that conditioned phenomenon? When an unlearned ordinary person is struck by feelings born of contact with ignorance, craving arises. That conditioned phenomenon is born from that. So that conditioned phenomenon is impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated. And that craving, that feeling, that contact, and that ignorance are also impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated. That’s how you should know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life. </p>
<p id="sn22.81:10.1">Perhaps they don’t regard form or feeling or perception or choices or consciousness as self. Still, they have such a view: ‘The self and the cosmos are one and the same. After passing away I will be permanent, everlasting, eternal, and imperishable.’ But that eternalist view is just a conditioned phenomenon. And what’s the source of that conditioned phenomenon? … That’s how you should know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life. </p>
<p id="sn22.81:11.1">Perhaps they don’t regard form or feeling or perception or choices or consciousness as self. Nor do they have such a view: ‘The self and the cosmos are one and the same. After passing away I will be permanent, everlasting, eternal, and imperishable.’ Still, they have such a view: ‘I might not be, and it might not be mine. I will not be, and it will not be mine.’ But that annihilationist view is just a conditioned phenomenon. And what’s the source of that conditioned phenomenon? … That’s how you should know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life. </p>

I will not be, and it will not be mine.’ Still, they have doubts and uncertainties. They’re undecided about the true teaching. That doubt and uncertainty, the indecision about the true teaching, is just a conditioned phenomenon. And what’s the source of that conditioned phenomenon?

<p id="sn22.80:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. </p>
<p id="sn22.80:1.2">Then the Buddha, having dismissed the mendicant Saṅgha for some reason, robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kapilavatthu for alms. He wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Great Wood, plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a young wood apple tree for the day’s meditation. </p>
<p id="sn22.80:2.1">Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, “I’ve sent the mendicant Saṅgha away. But there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. Not seeing me they may change and fall apart. If a young calf doesn’t see its mother it may change and fall apart. … Or if young seedlings don’t get water they may change and fall apart. In the same way, there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. Not seeing me they may change and fall apart. Why don’t I support the mendicant Saṅgha now as I did in the past?” </p>
<p id="sn22.80:3.1">Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: “That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! The Buddha has sent the mendicant Saṅgha away. But there are mendicants who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. … May the Buddha be happy with the mendicant Saṅgha! May the Buddha welcome the mendicant Saṅgha! May the Buddha support the mendicant Saṅgha now as he did in the past!” </p>
<p id="sn22.80:4.1">The Buddha consented with silence. Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing that the Buddha had consented, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there. </p>
<p id="sn22.80:5.1">Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the Banyan Tree Monastery, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then he used his psychic power to will that the mendicants would come to him timidly, alone or in pairs. Those mendicants approached the Buddha timidly, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them: </p>
<p id="sn22.80:6.1">“Mendicants, this relying on alms is an extreme lifestyle. The world curses you: ‘You beggar, walking bowl in hand!’ Yet earnest gentlemen take it up for a good reason. Not because they’ve been forced to by kings or bandits, or because they’re in debt or threatened, or to earn a living. But because they’re swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They’re swamped by suffering, mired in suffering. And they think, ‘Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’ </p>
<p id="sn22.80:7.1">That’s how this gentleman has gone forth. Yet they covet sensual pleasures; they’re infatuated, full of ill will and malicious intent. They are unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying mind and undisciplined faculties. Suppose there was a firebrand for lighting a funeral pyre, burning at both ends, and smeared with dung in the middle. It couldn’t be used as timber either in the village or the wilderness. I say that person is just like this. They’ve missed out on the pleasures of the lay life, and haven’t fulfilled the goal of the ascetic life. </p>
<p id="sn22.80:8.1">There are these three unskillful thoughts. Sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts. And where do these three unskillful thoughts cease without anything left over? In those who meditate with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation; or who develop signless immersion. This is quite enough motivation to develop signless immersion. When signless immersion is developed and cultivated it is very fruitful and beneficial. </p>
<p id="sn22.80:9.1">There are these two views. Views favoring continued existence and views favoring ending existence. A learned noble disciple reflects on this: ‘Is there anything in the world that I could grasp without fault?’ They understand: ‘There’s nothing in the world that I could grasp without fault. For in grasping I would grasp only at form, feeling, perception, choices, or consciousness. That grasping of mine would be a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. </p>
<p id="sn22.80:10.1">What do you think, mendicants? Is form permanent or impermanent?” </p>
<p id="sn22.80:10.3">“Impermanent, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn22.80:10.4">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” </p>
<p id="sn22.80:10.5">“Suffering, sir.” </p>

<p id="sn22.80:10.8">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn22.80:10.9">“Is feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?” … </p>
<p id="sn22.80:10.13">“So you should truly see … </p>

<p id="sn22.79:2.1">And why do you call it form? It’s deformed; that’s why it’s called ‘form’. Deformed by what? Deformed by cold, heat, hunger, and thirst, and deformed by the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. It’s deformed; that’s why it’s called ‘form’. </p>

<p id="sn22.79:5.1">And why do you call them choices? Choices produce conditioned phenomena; that’s why they’re called ‘choices’. And what are the conditioned phenomena that they produce? Form is a conditioned phenomenon; choices are what make it into form. Feeling is a conditioned phenomenon; choices are what make it into feeling. Perception is a conditioned phenomenon; choices are what make it into perception. Choices are conditioned phenomena; choices are what make them into choices. Consciousness is a conditioned phenomenon; choices are what make it into consciousness. Choices produce conditioned phenomena; that’s why they’re called ‘choices’. </p>

<p id="sn22.78:1.1">At Sāvatthī. </p>
<p id="sn22.78:1.2">“Mendicants, towards evening the lion, king of beasts, emerges from his den, yawns, looks all around the four quarters, and roars his lion’s roar three times. Then he sets out on the hunt. And whatever animals hear the roar of the lion, king of beasts, are typically filled with fear, awe, and terror. They return to their lairs, be they in a hole, the water, or a wood; and the birds take to the air. Even the royal elephants, bound with strong harness in the villages, towns, and capital cities, break apart their bonds, and urinate and defecate in terror as they flee here and there. That’s how powerful is the lion, king of beasts, among animals, how illustrious and mighty. </p>
<p id="sn22.78:2.1">In the same way, when a Realized One arises in the world—perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed—he teaches the Dhamma: ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling … Such is perception … Such are choices … Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ </p>
<p id="sn22.78:2.7">Now, there are gods who are long-lived, beautiful, and very happy, living for ages in their divine palaces. When they hear this teaching by the Realized One, they’re typically filled with fear, awe, and terror. ‘Oh no! It turns out we’re impermanent, though we thought we were permanent! It turns out we don’t last, though we thought we were everlasting! It turns out we’re short-lived, though we thought we were eternal! It turns out that we’re impermanent, not lasting, short-lived, and included within identity.’ That’s how powerful is the Realized One in the world with its gods, how illustrious and mighty.” </p>
<p id="sn22.78:2.13">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn22.78:3.1">“The Buddha, the teacher without a peer <br/>in all the world with its gods, <br/>rolls forth the Wheel of Dhamma <br/>from his own insight: </p>
<p id="sn22.78:4.1">identity, its cessation, <br/>the origin of identity, <br/>and the noble eightfold path <br/>that leads to the stilling of suffering. </p>
<p id="sn22.78:5.1">And then the long-lived gods, <br/>so beautiful and glorious, <br/>are afraid and full of terror, <br/>like the other beasts when they hear a lion. </p>
<p id="sn22.78:6.1">‘We haven’t transcended identity! <br/>It turns out we’re impermanent!’ <br/>So they say when they hear the word <br/>of the perfected one, free and poised.” </p>

<p id="sn22.3:3.1">How should we see the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement?” </p>
<p id="sn22.3:4.1">“Householder, the form element is a shelter for consciousness. One whose consciousness is shackled to greed for the form element is called a migrant going from shelter to shelter.

The perception element is a shelter for consciousness. One whose consciousness is attached to greed for the perception element is called a migrant going from shelter to shelter.

That’s how one is a migrant with no shelter. </p>
<p id="sn22.3:6.1">And how is one a migrant going from settlement to settlement?

That’s how one is a migrant going from settlement to settlement. </p>
<p id="sn22.3:7.1">And how is one an unsettled migrant? The Realized One has given up attachment to drifting between settlements in pursuit of sights.

<p id="sn22.3:10.1">And how is one not rid of sensual pleasures? It’s when someone isn’t rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for sensual pleasures. That’s how one is not rid of sensual pleasures. </p>

<p id="sn22.2:2.1">“But mendicants, have you taken leave of Sāriputta?” </p>

<p id="sn22.2:3.1">Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was meditating not far from the Buddha in a clump of golden shower trees. And then those mendicants approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went up to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him. </p>
<p id="sn22.2:3.3">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him, “Reverend Sāriputta, we wish to go to a western land to take up residence there. We have taken leave of the Teacher.” </p>
<p id="sn22.2:4.1">“Reverends, there are those who question a mendicant who has gone abroad—astute aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics—for astute people are inquisitive: ‘But what does the venerables’ Teacher teach? What does he explain?’ I trust the venerables have properly heard, learned, attended, and remembered the teachings, and penetrated them with wisdom. That way, when answering you will repeat what the Buddha has said and not misrepresent him with an untruth. You will explain in line with the teaching, with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism.” </p>
<p id="sn22.2:5.1">“Reverend, we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta. May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this.” </p>

<p id="sn22.2:7.1">When you answer like this, such astute people may inquire further: ‘But regarding what does the venerables’ teacher explain the removal of desire and lust?’ When questioned like this, reverends, you should answer: ‘Our teacher explains the removal of desire and lust for form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.’ </p>
<p id="sn22.2:8.1">When you answer like this, such astute people may inquire further: ‘But what drawback has he seen that he teaches the removal of desire and lust for form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?’ When questioned like this, reverends, you should answer: ‘If you’re not free of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for form, when that form decays and perishes it gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. If you’re not free of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, when that consciousness decays and perishes it gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. This is the drawback our Teacher has seen that he teaches the removal of desire and lust for form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.’ </p>
<p id="sn22.2:9.1">When you answer like this, such astute people may inquire further: ‘But what benefit has he seen that he teaches the removal of desire and lust for form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?’ When questioned like this, reverends, you should answer: ‘If you are rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for form, when that form decays and perishes it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. If you are rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, when that consciousness decays and perishes it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.

<p id="sn22.2:10.1">If those who acquired and kept unskillful qualities were to live happily in the present life, free of anguish, distress, and fever; and if, when their body breaks up, after death, they could expect to go to a good place, the Buddha would not praise giving up unskillful qualities. But since those who acquire and keep unskillful qualities live unhappily in the present life, full of anguish, distress, and fever; and since, when their body breaks up, after death, they can expect to go to a bad place, the Buddha praises giving up unskillful qualities. </p>
<p id="sn22.2:11.1">If those who embraced and kept skillful qualities were to live unhappily in the present life, full of anguish, distress, and fever; and if, when their body breaks up, after death, they could expect to go to a bad place, the Buddha would not praise embracing skillful qualities.

<p id="sn22.1:5.4">So Nakula’s father told Sāriputta all that had happened, and said, “That’s the ambrosial Dhamma talk that the Buddha anointed me with.” </p>

<p id="sn22.1:13.5">That’s how a person is ailing in body and ailing in mind. </p>
<p id="sn22.1:14.1">And how is a person ailing in body and healthy in mind? It’s when a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons. They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They’re not obsessed with the thought: ‘I am form, form is mine!’ So when that form of theirs decays and perishes, it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. </p>
<p id="sn22.1:15.1">They don’t regard feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in self, or self in feeling.

<p id="sn21.10:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. </p>
<p id="sn21.10:1.2">Now at that time there was a certain mendicant named Senior. He lived alone and praised living alone. He entered the village for alms alone, returned alone, sat in private alone, and concentrated on walking mindfully alone. </p>
<p id="sn21.10:1.4">Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, there’s a certain mendicant named Senior who lives alone and praises living alone.” </p>
<p id="sn21.10:2.1">So the Buddha addressed a certain monk, “Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Senior that the teacher summons him.” </p>
<p id="sn21.10:2.4">“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Venerable Senior and said to him, “Reverend Senior, the teacher summons you.” </p>
<p id="sn21.10:2.6">“Yes, reverend,” that monk replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: </p>
<p id="sn21.10:2.7">“Is it really true, Senior, that you live alone and praise living alone?” </p>
<p id="sn21.10:2.8">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn21.10:2.9">“But in what way do you live alone and praise living alone?” </p>
<p id="sn21.10:2.10">“Well, sir, I enter the village for alms alone, return alone, sit in private alone, and concentrate on walking mindfully alone. That’s how I live alone and praise living alone.” </p>
<p id="sn21.10:3.1">“That is a kind of living alone, I don’t deny it. But as to how living alone is fulfilled in detail, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="sn21.10:3.4">“Yes, sir,” he replied. </p>
<p id="sn21.10:3.5">“And how, Senior, is living alone fulfilled in detail? It’s when what’s in the past is given up, what’s in the future is relinquished, and desire and greed for present incarnations is eliminated. That’s how living alone is fulfilled in detail.” </p>
<p id="sn21.10:4.1">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn21.10:5.1">“The champion, all-knower, so very intelligent, <br/>is unsullied in the midst of all things. <br/>He’s given up all, freed in the ending of craving: <br/>I declare that man to be one who lives alone.” </p>

<p id="sn21.9:1.2">Then Venerable Tissa—the Buddha’s cousin on his father’s side—went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. He was miserable and sad, with tears flowing. Then the Buddha said to him: </p>
<p id="sn21.9:1.3">“Tissa, why are you sitting there so miserable and sad, with tears flowing?” </p>
<p id="sn21.9:1.4">“Sir, it’s because the mendicants beset me on all sides with sneering and jeering.” </p>
<p id="sn21.9:1.5">“That’s because you admonish others, but don’t accept admonition yourself. As a gentleman who has gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness, it’s not appropriate for you to admonish others without accepting admonition yourself. It’s appropriate for you to admonish others and accept admonition yourself.” </p>

<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn21.9:3.1">“Why are you angry? Don’t be angry! <br/>It’s better to not be angry, Tissa. <br/>For this spiritual life is lived <br/>in order to remove anger, conceit, and denigration.” </p>

<p id="sn21.8:1.2">Then Venerable Nanda—the Buddha’s cousin on his mother’s side—dressed in nicely pressed and ironed robes, applied eyeshadow, and took a polished black bowl. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: </p>

<p id="sn21.7:2.1">Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall.

<p id="sn21.3:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>
<p id="sn21.3:1.3">At that time Venerables Sāriputta and Moggallāna were staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Moggallāna, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, Sāriputta sat down to one side, and said to Mahāmoggallāna: </p>
<p id="sn21.3:2.1">“Reverend Moggallāna, your faculties are so very clear, and your complexion is pure and bright. Have you spent the day in a peaceful meditation?” </p>
<p id="sn21.3:2.3">“Reverend, I’ve spent the day in a coarse meditation. But I have had some Dhamma talk.” </p>
<p id="sn21.3:2.5">“Who did you have a Dhamma talk with?” </p>
<p id="sn21.3:2.6">“With the Buddha.” </p>
<p id="sn21.3:2.7">“But Reverend, the Buddha is far away. He’s staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Did you go to him with your psychic power, or did he come to you?” </p>
<p id="sn21.3:2.10">“No reverend, I didn’t go to him with my psychic power, nor did he come to me. Rather, the Buddha cleared his clairvoyance and clairaudience towards me, and I cleared my clairvoyance and clairaudience towards him.” </p>
<p id="sn21.3:2.14">“But what manner of Dhamma talk did you have together?” </p>
<p id="sn21.3:3.1">“Well, reverend, I said to the Buddha, ‘Sir, they speak of one who is energetic. How is an energetic person defined?’ </p>
<p id="sn21.3:3.4">When I said this, the Buddha said, ‘Moggallāna, it’s when a mendicant lives with energy roused up: “Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.” That’s how a person is energetic.’ </p>
<p id="sn21.3:3.8">That’s the Dhamma talk I had together with the Buddha.” </p>
<p id="sn21.3:4.1">“Reverend, next to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna I’m like a few pieces of gravel next to the Himalayas, the king of mountains. Venerable Mahāmoggallāna is so mighty and powerful he could, if he wished, live on for the proper lifespan.” </p>
<p id="sn21.3:5.1">“Reverend, next to Venerable Sāriputta I’m like a few grains of salt next to a mound of salt. Venerable Sāriputta has been commended, complimented, and praised by the Buddha: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn21.3:6.1">‘In wisdom, <br/>ethics, and peace, <br/>any mendicant who has crossed over <br/>can at best equal Sāriputta.’” </p>

<p id="sn21.2:1.1">At Sāvatthī. </p>
<p id="sn21.2:1.2">There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants: “Reverends, mendicants!” </p>
<p id="sn21.2:1.4">“Reverend,” they replied. Sāriputta said this: </p>
<p id="sn21.2:2.1">“Just now, reverends, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind: ‘Is there anything in the world whose decay and perishing would give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in me?’ It occurred to me: ‘There is nothing in the world whose decay and perishing would give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in me.’” </p>
<p id="sn21.2:3.1">When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to him, “Even if the Teacher were to decay and perish? Wouldn’t that give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in you?” </p>
<p id="sn21.2:3.3">“Even if the Teacher were to decay and perish, that wouldn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in me. Still, I would think: ‘Alas, the illustrious Teacher, so mighty and powerful, has vanished! If the Buddha was to remain for a long time, that would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.’” </p>
<p id="sn21.2:3.6">“That must be because Venerable Sāriputta has long ago totally eradicated ego, possessiveness, and the underlying tendency to conceit. So even if the Teacher were to decay and perish, it wouldn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in him.” </p>

<p id="sn21.1:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the mendicants: “Reverends, mendicants!” </p>
<p id="sn21.1:1.5">“Reverend,” they replied. </p>
<p id="sn21.1:2.1">Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this: </p>
<p id="sn21.1:2.2">“Just now, reverends, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind: ‘They speak of this thing called “noble silence”. What then is this noble silence?’ </p>
<p id="sn21.1:2.5">It occurred to me: ‘As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. This is called noble silence.’ </p>
<p id="sn21.1:2.8">And so, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I was entering and remaining in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. </p>
<p id="sn21.1:2.9">While I was in that meditation, perceptions and attentions accompanied by placing the mind beset me. </p>
<p id="sn21.1:3.1">Then the Buddha came up to me with his psychic power and said, ‘Moggallāna, Moggallāna! Don’t neglect noble silence, brahmin! Settle your mind in noble silence; unify your mind and bring it to immersion in noble silence.’ </p>
<p id="sn21.1:3.3">And so, after some time, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption … </p>
<p id="sn21.1:3.4">So if anyone should be rightly called a disciple who attained to great direct knowledge with help from the Teacher, it’s me.” </p>

<p id="sn20.10:1.1">At Sāvatthī. </p>
<p id="sn20.10:1.2">Now at that time a certain mendicant socialized with families too often. </p>
<p id="sn20.10:1.3">The mendicants said to him, “Venerable, don’t socialize with families too often.” </p>
<p id="sn20.10:1.5">But that mendicant, when spoken to by the mendicants, did not stop. </p>
<p id="sn20.10:1.6">And then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said: </p>
<p id="sn20.10:2.1">“Once upon a time, mendicants, a cat was standing by an alley or a drain or a dustbin hunting a little mouse, thinking, ‘When that little mouse comes out to feed, I’ll catch it right there and eat it!’ And then that little mouse came out to feed. The cat caught it and hastily swallowed it without chewing. But that little mouse ate its intestines and mesentery, resulting in death and deadly pain. </p>
<p id="sn20.10:3.1">In the same way, take a certain monk who robes up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, enters the village or town for alms without guarding body, speech, and mind, without establishing mindfulness, and without restraining the sense faculties. There he sees a female scantily clad, with revealing clothes. Lust infects his mind, resulting in death or deadly pain. </p>
<p id="sn20.10:3.5">For it is death in the training of the Noble One to resign the training and return to a lesser life. And it is deadly pain to commit one of the corrupt offenses for which rehabilitation is possible. </p>
<p id="sn20.10:3.8">So you should train like this: ‘We will enter the village or town for alms guarding body, speech, and mind, establishing mindfulness, and restraining the sense faculties.’ That’s how you should train.” </p>

<p id="sn20.9:1.4">The mendicants said to him, “Venerable, don’t go to visit families too often.” </p>
<p id="sn20.9:1.6">But that mendicant, when spoken to by the mendicants, said this, “But these senior mendicants think they can go to visit families, so why can’t I?” </p>
<p id="sn20.9:2.1">And then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said: </p>
<p id="sn20.9:3.1">“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a great lake in the jungle, with bull elephants living nearby. They’d plunge into the lake and pull up lotus bulbs with their trunks. They’d wash them thoroughly until they were free of mud before chewing and swallowing them. That was good for their appearance and health, and wouldn’t result in death or deadly pain. </p>
<p id="sn20.9:3.5">The young cubs, following the example of the great bull elephants, plunged into the lake and pulled up lotus bulbs with their trunks. But they didn’t wash them thoroughly, and while they were still muddy they chewed and swallowed them. That was not good for their appearance and health, and resulted in death or deadly pain. </p>
<p id="sn20.9:4.1">In the same way, there are senior mendicants who robe up in the morning and, taking their bowl and robe, enter the town or village for alms. There they speak on the teachings, and lay people demonstrate their confidence in them. And when they get things, they use them untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawbacks, and understanding the escape. That’s good for their appearance and health, and doesn’t result in death or deadly pain. </p>
<p id="sn20.9:4.6">Junior mendicants, following the example of the senior mendicants, robe up in the morning and, taking their bowl and robe, enter the town or village for alms. There they speak on the teachings, and lay people demonstrate their confidence in them. But when they get things, they use them tied, infatuated, attached, blind to the drawbacks, not understanding the escape. That’s not good for their appearance and health, and results in death or deadly pain. </p>
<p id="sn20.9:4.11">So you should train like this: ‘When we get things, we will use them untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawbacks, and understanding the escape.’ That’s how you should train.” </p>

<p id="sn20.8:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>
<p id="sn20.8:1.5">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="sn20.8:2.1">“Mendicants, these days the Licchavis live using wood blocks as pillows, and they exercise diligently and keenly. King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, finds no vulnerability, he’s got no foothold. But in the future the Licchavis will become delicate, with soft and tender hands and feet. They’ll sleep on soft beds with down pillows until the sun comes up. King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha, will find a vulnerability, he’ll get his foothold. </p>
<p id="sn20.8:3.1">These days the mendicants live using wood blocks as pillows, and they meditate diligently and keenly. Māra the Wicked finds no vulnerability, he's got no foothold. But in the future the mendicants will become delicate, with soft and tender hands and feet. They’ll sleep on soft beds with down pillows until the sun comes up. Māra the Wicked will find a vulnerability and will get a foothold. </p>

<p id="sn20.7:1.1">At Sāvatthī. </p>
<p id="sn20.7:1.2">“Once upon a time, mendicants, the Dasārahas had a clay drum called the Commander. Each time the Commander split they repaired it by inserting another peg. But there came a time when the clay drum Commander’s original wooden rim disappeared and only a mass of pegs remained. </p>
<p id="sn20.7:1.6">In the same way, in a future time there will be mendicants who won’t want to listen when discourses spoken by the Realized One—deep, profound, transcendent, dealing with emptiness—are being recited. They won’t pay attention or apply their minds to understand them, nor will they think those teachings are worth learning and memorizing. </p>
<p id="sn20.7:2.1">But when discourses composed by poets—poetry, with fancy words and phrases, composed by outsiders or spoken by disciples—are being recited they will want to listen. They’ll pay attention and apply their minds to understand them, and they’ll think those teachings are worth learning and memorizing. And that is how the discourses spoken by the Realized One—deep, profound, transcendent, dealing with emptiness—will disappear. </p>
<p id="sn20.7:2.3">So you should train like this: ‘When discourses spoken by the Realized One—deep, profound, transcendent, dealing with emptiness—are being recited we will want to listen. We will pay attention and apply our minds to understand them, and we will think those teachings are worth learning and memorizing.’ That’s how you should train.” </p>

<p id="sn20.6:1.2">“Mendicants, suppose there were four well-trained expert archers with strong bows standing in the four quarters.

<p id="sn20.6:1.5">What do you think, mendicants? Are they qualified to be called ‘a speedster, with ultimate speed’?” </p>
<p id="sn20.6:2.1">“If he could catch an arrow shot by just one well-trained expert archer before it reaches the ground and bring it back, he’d be qualified to be called ‘a speedster, with ultimate speed’. How much more so arrows shot by four archers!” </p>
<p id="sn20.6:3.1">“As fast as that man is, the sun and moon are faster. As fast as that man is, as fast as the sun and moon are, and as fast as the deities that run before the sun and moon are, the waning of the life forces is faster. </p>

<p id="sn20.5:1.5">What do you think, mendicants? Is that man capable of doing so?” </p>
<p id="sn20.5:1.7">“No, sir. Why not? Because it’s not easy to fold that sharp spear over, crumple it, and bend it back with the hand or fist. That man will eventually get weary and frustrated.” </p>
<p id="sn20.5:2.1">“In the same way, suppose a mendicant has developed the heart’s release by love, has cultivated it, made it a vehicle and a basis, kept it up, consolidated it, and properly implemented it. Should any non-human think to overthrow their mind, they’ll eventually get weary and frustrated. </p>

<p id="sn20.2:1.5">“Sir, the great earth is far more. The little bit of dirt under your fingernail is tiny. Compared to the great earth, it doesn’t count, there’s no comparison, it’s not worth a fraction.” </p>

Then Mahāmoggallāna robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Lakkhaṇa and said to him, “Come, Reverend Lakkhaṇa, let’s enter Rājagaha for alms.” </p>

<p id="sn19.1:2.1">Then Lakkhaṇa and Mahāmoggallāna wandered for alms in Rājagaha. After the meal, on their return from almsround, they went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Lakkhaṇa said to Mahāmoggallāna: </p>
<p id="sn19.1:2.2">“Just now, as Mahāmoggallāna was descending from Vulture’s Peak Mountain he smiled at a certain spot. What is the cause, Reverend Moggallāna, what is the reason you smiled?” </p>
<p id="sn19.1:3.1">“Just now, reverend, as I was descending from Vulture’s Peak Mountain I saw a skeleton flying through the air. Vultures, crows, and hawks kept chasing it, pecking, clawing, and stabbing it in the ribs as it screeched in pain. It occurred to me: ‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! That there can be such a sentient being, such an entity, such an incarnation!’” </p>
<p id="sn19.1:4.1">Then the Buddha said to the mendicants: </p>

<p id="sn16.13:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then Venerable Mahākassapa went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="sn16.13:1.4">“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why there used to be fewer training rules but more enlightened mendicants? And what is the cause, what is the reason why these days there are more training rules and fewer enlightened mendicants?” </p>
<p id="sn16.13:1.6">“That’s how it is, Kassapa. When sentient beings are in decline and the true teaching is disappearing there are more training rules and fewer enlightened mendicants. The true teaching doesn’t disappear as long the counterfeit of the true teaching hasn’t appeared in the world. But when the counterfeit of the true teaching appears in the world then the true teaching disappears. </p>
<p id="sn16.13:2.1">It’s like true gold, which doesn’t disappear as long as counterfeit gold hasn’t appeared in the world. But when counterfeit gold appears in the world then real gold disappears. </p>
<p id="sn16.13:2.3">In the same way, the true teaching doesn’t disappear as long the counterfeit of the true teaching hasn’t appeared in the world. But when the counterfeit of the true teaching appears in the world then the true teaching disappears. </p>
<p id="sn16.13:3.1">It’s not the elements of earth, water, fire, or air that make the true teaching disappear. Rather, it’s the foolish people who appear right here that make the true teaching disappear. The true teaching doesn’t disappear like a ship that sinks all at once. </p>
<p id="sn16.13:4.1">There are five detrimental things that lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching. What five? It’s when the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen lack respect and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the training, and immersion. These five detrimental things lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching. </p>
<p id="sn16.13:5.1">There are five things that lead to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching. What five? It’s when the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen maintain respect and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, the Saṅgha, the training, and immersion. These five things lead to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching.” </p>

<p id="sn16.12:1.2">Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Mahākassapa, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Mahākassapa: </p>
<p id="sn16.12:1.4">“Reverend Kassapa, does a Realized One exist after death?” </p>
<p id="sn16.12:1.5">“Reverend, this has not been declared by the Buddha.” </p>

<p id="sn16.12:1.14">“This too has not been declared by the Buddha.” </p>
<p id="sn16.12:1.16">“And why has this not been declared by the Buddha?” </p>
<p id="sn16.12:1.17">“Because it’s not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. That’s why it has not been declared by the Buddha.” </p>
<p id="sn16.12:2.1">“So what now has been declared by the Buddha?” “‘This is suffering’ has been declared by the Buddha. ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’ has been declared by the Buddha.” </p>

<p id="sn16.11:1.1">At one time Venerable Mahākassapa was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. Now at that time Venerable Ānanda was wandering in the Southern Hills together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. </p>
<p id="sn16.11:2.1">And at that time thirty of Ānanda’s mendicant pupils resigned the training and returned to a lesser life. Most of them were youths. </p>
<p id="sn16.11:2.2">When Venerable Ānanda had wandered in the Southern Hills as long as he pleased, he set out for Rājagaha, to the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. He went up to Venerable Mahākassapa, bowed, and sat down to one side. Mahākassapa said to him: </p>
<p id="sn16.11:2.3">“Reverend Ānanda, for how many reasons did the Buddha lay down a rule against eating in groups of more than three among families?” </p>
<p id="sn16.11:3.1">“Sir, the Buddha laid down that rule for three reasons. For keeping difficult persons in check and for the comfort of good-hearted mendicants. To prevent those of corrupt wishes from taking sides and dividing the Saṅgha. And out of consideration for families. These are the three reasons why the Buddha laid down that rule.” </p>
<p id="sn16.11:4.1">“So what exactly are you doing, wandering together with these junior mendicants? They don’t guard their sense doors, they eat too much, and they’re not committed to wakefulness. It’s like you’re wandering about wrecking crops and ruining families! Your following is falling apart, Reverend Ānanda, and those just getting started are slipping away. Yet this boy knows no bounds!” </p>
<p id="sn16.11:5.1">“Though there are grey hairs on my head, I still can’t escape being called a boy by Venerable Mahākassapa.” </p>
<p id="sn16.11:5.3">“It’s because you wander with these junior mendicants. … Your following is falling apart, Reverend Ānanda, and those just getting started are slipping away. Yet this boy knows no bounds!” </p>
<p id="sn16.11:6.1">The nun Thullanandā heard a rumor that Master Mahākassapa had rebuked Master Ānanda the Videhan sage by calling him a boy. </p>
<p id="sn16.11:7.1">She was upset and blurted out, “How can Master Mahākassapa, who formerly followed another religion, presume to rebuke Master Ānanda the Videhan sage by calling him a boy?” </p>
<p id="sn16.11:7.3">Mahākassapa heard Thullanandā say these words, and he said to Ānanda, “Indeed, Reverend Ānanda, the nun Thullanandā spoke rashly and without reflection. </p>
<p id="sn16.11:8.3">Since I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness, I don’t recall acknowledging any other teacher apart from the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. </p>
<p id="sn16.11:8.4">Formerly when I was still a layman, I thought: ‘Living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ After some time I made an outer robe of patches and, in the name of the perfected ones in the world, I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="sn16.11:9.1">When I had gone forth, I traveled along the road between Rājagaha and Nāḷandā, where I saw the Buddha sitting at the Many Sons Shrine. Seeing him, I thought: ‘If I’m ever to see a Teacher, it would be this Blessed One! If I’m ever to see a Holy One, it would be this Blessed One! If I’m ever to see a fully awakened Buddha, it would be this Blessed One!’ </p>
<p id="sn16.11:9.7">Then I bowed with my head at the Buddha’s feet and said: ‘Sir, the Buddha is my Teacher, I am his disciple! The Buddha is my Teacher, I am his disciple!’ </p>
<p id="sn16.11:9.10">The Buddha said to me, ‘Kassapa, if anyone was to say to such a wholehearted disciple that they know when they don’t know, or that they see when they don’t see, their head would explode. But Kassapa, when I say that I know and see I really do know and see. </p>
<p id="sn16.11:10.1">So you should train like this: “I will set up a keen sense of conscience and prudence for seniors, juniors, and those in the middle.” That’s how you should train. </p>
<p id="sn16.11:11.1">And you should train like this: “Whenever I hear a teaching connected with what’s skillful, I will pay heed, pay attention, engage wholeheartedly, and lend an ear to that teaching.” That’s how you should train. </p>
<p id="sn16.11:12.1">And you should train like this: “I will never neglect mindfulness of the body that is full of pleasure.” That’s how you should train.’ </p>
<p id="sn16.11:13.1">And when the Buddha had given me this advice he got up from his seat and left. For seven days I ate the nation’s almsfood as a debtor. On the eighth day I was enlightened. </p>
<p id="sn16.11:14.1">And then the Buddha left the road and went to the root of a certain tree. So I spread out my outer robe of patches folded in four and said to him, ‘Sir, sit here. That would be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’ </p>
<p id="sn16.11:14.4">The Buddha sat on the seat spread out and said to me, ‘Kassapa, this outer robe of patches is soft.’ </p>

<p id="sn16.11:14.8">‘In that case, Kassapa, will you wear my worn-out hempen rag robe?’ </p>
<p id="sn16.11:14.9">‘I will wear it, sir.’ </p>

<p id="sn16.10:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time Venerable Mahākassapa was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Mahākassapa and said, “Kassapa, come, sir. Let’s go to one of the nuns’ quarters.” </p>
<p id="sn16.10:1.5">“You go, Reverend Ānanda. You have many duties and responsibilities.” </p>
<p id="sn16.10:1.6">And a second time … </p>
<p id="sn16.10:1.9">And a third time, Ānanda said, “Come, Honorable Kassapa. Let’s go to one of the nuns’ quarters.” </p>
<p id="sn16.10:2.1">Then Venerable Mahākassapa robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went with Venerable Ānanda as his second monk to one of the nuns’ quarters, where he sat on the seat spread out. And then several nuns went up to Mahākassapa, bowed, and sat down to one side. Mahākassapa educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired those nuns with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. </p>
<p id="sn16.10:3.1">But the nun Thullatissā was upset and blurted out, “What is Master Mahākassapa thinking, that he’d teach Dhamma in front of Master Ānanda, the Videhan sage? He’s like a needle seller who thinks they can sell a needle to a needle maker!” </p>
<p id="sn16.10:4.1">Mahākassapa heard Thullatissā say these words, and he said to Ānanda, “Is that right, Reverend Ānanda? Am I the needle seller and you the needle maker? Or am I the needle maker and you the needle seller?” </p>
<p id="sn16.10:4.5">“Forgive her, sir. The woman’s a fool.” </p>
<p id="sn16.10:4.6">“Hold on, Reverend Ānanda! Don’t make the Saṅgha investigate you further! </p>
<p id="sn16.10:5.1">What do you think, Reverend Ānanda? Was it you who the Buddha brought up before the Saṅgha of mendicants, saying: ‘Mendicants, whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. And so does Ānanda’?” </p>
<p id="sn16.10:5.5">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn16.10:6.1">“I was the one the Buddha brought up before the Saṅgha of mendicants, saying: ‘Mendicants, whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.

<p id="sn16.9:1.1">At Sāvatthī. </p>
<p id="sn16.9:1.2">“Mendicants, whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. And so does Kassapa. </p>
<p id="sn16.9:2.1">Whenever I want, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, I enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And so does Kassapa. </p>
<p id="sn16.9:3.1">Whenever I want, with the fading away of rapture, I enter and remain in the third absorption, where I meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ And so does Kassapa. </p>
<p id="sn16.9:4.1">Whenever I want, with the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. And so does Kassapa. </p>
<p id="sn16.9:5.1">Whenever I want, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, I enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space. And so does Kassapa. </p>
<p id="sn16.9:6.1">Whenever I want, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, I enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness. And so does Kassapa. </p>
<p id="sn16.9:7.1">Whenever I want, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, I enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. And so does Kassapa. </p>
<p id="sn16.9:8.1">Whenever I want, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, I enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. And so does Kassapa. </p>
<p id="sn16.9:9.1">Whenever I want, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, I enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling. And so does Kassapa. </p>
<p id="sn16.9:10.1">Whenever I want, I wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying myself and becoming one again; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. I control the body as far as the Brahmā realm. And so does Kassapa. </p>
<p id="sn16.9:11.1">Whenever I want, with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, I hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far. And so does Kassapa. </p>
<p id="sn16.9:12.1">Whenever I want, I understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with my mind. I understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’, and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’; mind with hate … mind without hate … mind with delusion … mind without delusion … constricted mind … scattered mind … expansive mind … unexpansive mind … mind that is not supreme … mind that is supreme … mind immersed in samādhi … mind not immersed in samādhi … freed mind … unfreed mind … And so does Kassapa. </p>
<p id="sn16.9:13.1">Whenever I want, I recollect my many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. I remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so I recollect my many kinds of past lives, with features and details. And so does Kassapa. </p>
<p id="sn16.9:14.1">Whenever I want, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. And so does Kassapa. </p>
<p id="sn16.9:15.1">I have realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And I live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements. And so does Kassapa.” </p>

<p id="sn16.8:1.1">Near Rājagaha, in the squirrels’ feeding ground. Then Venerable Mahākassapa went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: </p>
<p id="sn16.8:1.3">“Kassapa, advise the mendicants! Give them a Dhamma talk! Either you or I should advise the mendicants and give them a Dhamma talk.” </p>
<p id="sn16.8:2.1">“Sir, the mendicants these days are hard to admonish, having qualities that make them hard to admonish. They’re impatient, and don’t take instruction respectfully.” </p>
<p id="sn16.8:2.2">“Kassapa, that’s because formerly the senior mendicants lived in the wilderness, ate only almsfood, wore rag robes, and owned just three robes; and they praised these things. They were of few wishes, content, secluded, aloof, and energetic; and they praised these things. </p>
<p id="sn16.8:3.1">The senior mendicants invite such a mendicant to a seat, saying: ‘Welcome, mendicant! What is this mendicant’s name? This mendicant is good-natured; he really wants to train. Please, mendicant, take a seat.’ </p>
<p id="sn16.8:4.1">Then the junior mendicants think: ‘It seems that when a mendicant lives in the wilderness … and is energetic, and praises these things, senior mendicants invite them to a seat …’ They practice accordingly. That is for their lasting welfare and happiness. </p>
<p id="sn16.8:5.1">But these days, Kassapa, the senior mendicants don’t live in the wilderness … and aren’t energetic; and they don’t praise these things. </p>
<p id="sn16.8:6.1">When a mendicant is well-known and famous, a recipient of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick, senior mendicants invite them to a seat: ‘Welcome, mendicant! What is this mendicant’s name? This mendicant is good-natured; he really likes his fellow monks. Please, mendicant, take a seat.’ </p>

That is for their lasting harm and suffering. And if it could ever be rightly said that spiritual practitioners are imperiled by the peril of a spiritual practitioner, and vanquished by the vanquishing of a spiritual practitioner, it is these days that this could be rightly said.” </p>

<p id="sn16.6:3.1">So the Buddha addressed a certain monk, “Please, monk, in my name tell the monk called Bhaṇḍa, Ānanda’s pupil, and the monk called Abhiñjika, Anuruddha’s pupil that the teacher summons them.” </p>
<p id="sn16.6:3.4">“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to those monks and said, “Venerables, the teacher summons you.” </p>

This kind of mendicant is worthy of approaching families. </p>
<p id="sn16.3:4.1">When Kassapa approaches families, his mind is not stuck or held or caught, thinking: ‘May those who want material possessions get them, and may those who want merit make merits!’ He’s just as pleased and happy when others get something as he is when he gets something. </p>
<p id="sn16.3:5.1">What do you think, mendicants? What kind of mendicant’s teaching is pure, and what kind is impure?” </p>
<p id="sn16.3:5.3">“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” </p>
<p id="sn16.3:5.4">“Well then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="sn16.3:5.5">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="sn16.3:6.1">“Whoever teaches Dhamma to others with the thought: ‘Oh! May they listen to the teaching from me. When they’ve heard it, may they gain confidence in the teaching and demonstrate their confidence to me.’ Such a mendicant’s teaching is impure. </p>
<p id="sn16.3:7.1">Whoever teaches Dhamma to others with the thought: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves. Oh! May they listen to the teaching from me. When they’ve heard it, may they understand the teaching and practice accordingly.’ So they teach others because of the natural excellence of the teaching, out of compassion, kindness, and sympathy. Such a mendicant’s teaching is pure. </p>
<p id="sn16.3:8.1">Kassapa teaches Dhamma to others with the thought: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves. Oh! May they listen to the teaching from me. When they’ve heard it, may they understand the teaching and practice accordingly.’ </p>
<p id="sn16.3:8.4">Thus he teaches others because of the natural excellence of the teaching, out of compassion, kindness, and sympathy. I will exhort you with the example of Kassapa or someone like him. You should practice accordingly.” </p>

<p id="sn16.2:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time Venerable Mahākassapa and Venerable Sāriputta were staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana. </p>
<p id="sn16.2:1.3">Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Sāriputta came out of retreat, went to Venerable Mahākassapa, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Mahākassapa: </p>
<p id="sn16.2:1.5">“Reverend Kassapa, it’s said that without being keen and prudent you can’t achieve awakening, extinguishment, and the supreme sanctuary. But if you’re keen and prudent you can achieve awakening, extinguishment, and the supreme sanctuary. </p>
<p id="sn16.2:2.1">To what extent is this the case?” </p>
<p id="sn16.2:2.3">“Reverend, take a mendicant who doesn’t foster keenness by thinking: ‘If unarisen unskillful qualities arise in me, they’ll lead to harm.’ ‘If I don’t give up arisen unskillful qualities, they’ll lead to harm.’ ‘If I don’t give rise to unarisen skillful qualities, they’ll lead to harm.’ ‘If arisen skillful qualities cease in me, they’ll lead to harm.’ That’s how you’re not keen. </p>

Take a mendicant who doesn’t foster prudence by thinking: ‘If unarisen unskillful qualities arise in me, they’ll lead to harm.’ ‘If I don’t give up arisen unskillful qualities, they’ll lead to harm.’ ‘If I don’t give rise to unarisen skillful qualities, they’ll lead to harm.’ ‘If arisen skillful qualities cease in me, they’ll lead to harm.’ That’s how you’re not prudent. That’s how without being keen and prudent you can’t achieve awakening, extinguishment, and the supreme sanctuary. </p>
<p id="sn16.2:4.1">And how are you keen?

<p id="sn15.20:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>
<p id="sn15.20:1.4">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="sn15.20:2.1">“Mendicants, transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving. Once upon a time, mendicants, this Mount Vepulla was known as Pācīnavaṁsa. And at that time people were known as Tivaras. The lifespan of the Tivaras was 40,000 years. It took them four days to climb Mount Vepulla, and four days to descend. At that time Kakusandha, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world. Kakusandha had a fine pair of chief disciples named Vidhura and Sañjīva. See, mendicants! This mountain’s name has vanished, those people have passed away, and that Buddha has become fully extinguished. So impermanent are conditions, so unstable are conditions, so unreliable are conditions. This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions. </p>
<p id="sn15.20:3.1">Once upon a time this Mount Vepulla was known as Vaṅkaka. And at that time people were known as Rohitassas. The lifespan of the Rohitassas was 30,000 years. It took them three days to climb Mount Vepulla, and three days to descend. At that time Koṇāgamana, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world. Koṇāgamana had a fine pair of chief disciples named Bhiyyosa and Uttara. See, mendicants! This mountain’s name has vanished, those people have passed away, and that Buddha has become fully extinguished. So impermanent are conditions … </p>
<p id="sn15.20:4.1">Once upon a time this Mount Vepulla was known as Supassa. And at that time people were known as Suppiyas. The lifespan of the Suppiyas was 20,000 years. It took them two days to climb Mount Vepulla, and two days to descend. At that time Kassapa, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world. Kassapa had a fine pair of chief disciples named Tissa and Bhāradvāja. See, mendicants! This mountain’s name has vanished, those people have passed away, and that Buddha has become fully extinguished. So impermanent are conditions … </p>
<p id="sn15.20:5.1">These days this Mount Vepulla is known as Vepulla. And these people are known as Magadhans. The lifespan of the Magadhans is short, brief, and fleeting. A long life is a hundred years or a little more. It takes the Magadhans an hour to climb Mount Vepulla, and an hour to descend. And now I am the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha who has arisen in the world. I have a fine pair of chief disciples named Sāriputta and Moggallāna. There will come a time when this mountain’s name will vanish, those people will die, and I will be fully extinguished. So impermanent are conditions, so unstable are conditions, so unreliable are conditions. This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions.” </p>
<p id="sn15.20:6.1">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn15.20:7.1">“For the Tivaras it was Pācīnavaṁsa, <br/>for the Rohitassa, Vaṅkaka, <br/>Supassa for the Suppiyas, <br/>and Vepulla for the Magadhans. </p>
<p id="sn15.20:8.1">Oh! Conditions are impermanent, <br/>their nature is to rise and fall; <br/>having arisen, they cease; <br/>their stilling is true bliss.” </p>

<p id="sn15.13:1.1">Near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove. Then thirty mendicants from Pāvā went to the Buddha. All of them lived in the wilderness, ate only almsfood, wore rag robes, and owned just three robes; yet they all still had fetters. They bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. </p>
<p id="sn15.13:1.3">Then it occurred to the Buddha, “These thirty mendicants from Pāvā live in the wilderness, eat only almsfood, wear rag robes, and own just three robes; yet they all still have fetters. Why don’t I teach them the Dhamma in such a way that their minds are freed from defilements by not grasping while sitting in this very seat?” </p>
<p id="sn15.13:1.6">Then the Buddha said to the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>
<p id="sn15.13:1.8">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>

<p id="sn15.13:2.3">What do you think? Which is more: the flow of blood you’ve shed when your head was chopped off while roaming and transmigrating for such a very long time, or the water in the four oceans?” </p>
<p id="sn15.13:2.4">“As we understand the Buddha’s teaching, the flow of blood we’ve shed when our head was chopped off while roaming and transmigrating is more than the water in the four oceans.” </p>
<p id="sn15.13:3.1">“Good, good, mendicants! It’s good that you understand my teaching like this. The flow of blood you’ve shed when your head was chopped off while roaming and transmigrating is indeed more than the water in the four oceans. For a long time you’ve been cows, and the flow of blood you’ve shed when your head was chopped off as a cow is more than the water in the four oceans. For a long time you’ve been buffalo … rams … goats … deer … chickens … pigs … For a long time you’ve been bandits, arrested for raiding villages, highway robbery, or adultery. And the flow of blood you’ve shed when your head was chopped off as a bandit is more than the water in the four oceans. </p>
<p id="sn15.13:3.13">Why is that? Transmigration has no known beginning. … This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions.” </p>
<p id="sn15.13:4.1">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of the thirty mendicants from Pāvā were freed from defilements by not grasping. </p>

<p id="sn15.10:4.1">“If the bones of a single person <br/>for a single eon were gathered up, <br/>they’d make a pile the size of a mountain: <br/>so said the great hermit. </p>

<p id="sn12.70:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. </p>
<p id="sn12.70:1.3">Now at that time the Buddha was honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And he received robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And the mendicant Saṅgha was also honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And they received robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. But the wanderers who followed other religions were not honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And they didn’t receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. </p>
<p id="sn12.70:2.1">Now at that time the wanderer Susīma was residing at Rājagaha together with a large community of wanderers. </p>
<p id="sn12.70:2.2">Then his community said to Susīma, “Reverend Susīma, please lead the spiritual life with the ascetic Gotama. Memorize that teaching and have us recite it with you. When we’ve memorized it we’ll recite it to the laity. In this way we too will be honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And we’ll receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:2.7">“Yes, reverends,” replied Susīma. Then he went to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda, “Reverend Ānanda, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:3.1">Then Ānanda took Susīma to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, this wanderer Susīma says that he wishes to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:3.4">“Well then, Ānanda, give Susīma the going forth.” And the wanderer Susīma received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. </p>
<p id="sn12.70:4.1">Now at that time several mendicants had declared their enlightenment in the Buddha’s presence: “We understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:4.3">Venerable Susīma heard about this. He went up to those mendicants, and exchanged greetings with them. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to those mendicants, “Is it really true that the venerables have declared enlightenment in the Buddha’s presence?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:4.10">“Yes, reverend.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:5.1">“But knowing and seeing thus, do you wield the many kinds of psychic power? That is, multiplying yourselves and becoming one again; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. Do you control the body as far as the Brahmā realm?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:5.2">“No, reverend.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:6.1">“Well, knowing and seeing thus do you, with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:6.2">“No, reverend.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:7.1">“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with your mind? Do you understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’, and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’? Do you understand mind with hate as ‘mind with hate’, and mind without hate as ‘mind without hate’? Do you understand mind with delusion as ‘mind with delusion’, and mind without delusion as ‘mind without delusion’? Do you understand constricted mind as ‘constricted mind’, and scattered mind as ‘scattered mind’? Do you understand expansive mind as ‘expansive mind’, and unexpansive mind as ‘unexpansive mind’? Do you understand mind that is not supreme as ‘mind that is not supreme’, and mind that is supreme as ‘mind that is supreme’? Do you understand mind immersed in samādhi as ‘mind immersed in samādhi’, and mind not immersed in samādhi as ‘mind not immersed in samādhi’? Do you understand freed mind as ‘freed mind’, and unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:7.18">“No, reverend.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:8.1">“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding? Do you remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ Do you recollect your many kinds of past lives, with features and details?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:8.2">“No, reverend.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:9.1">“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place—and understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds? ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, do you see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. And do you understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:9.2">“No, reverend.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:10.1">“Well, knowing and seeing thus, do you have direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless, transcending form?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:10.2">“No, reverend.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:11.1">“Well now, venerables, how could there be such a declaration when these things are not attained?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:11.2">“Reverend Susīma, we are freed by wisdom.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:12.1">“I don’t understand the detailed meaning of what you have said in brief. Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:12.3">“Reverend Susīma, whether you understand or not, we are freed by wisdom.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:13.1">Then Susīma went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and informed the Buddha of all he had discussed with those mendicants. </p>
<p id="sn12.70:13.3">“Susīma, first comes knowledge of the stability of natural principles. Afterwards there is knowledge of extinguishment.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:14.1">“Sir, I don’t understand the detailed meaning of what you have said in brief. Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:14.3">“Susīma, whether you understand or not, first comes knowledge of the stability of natural principles. Afterwards there is knowledge of extinguishment. </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.1">What do you think, Susīma? Is form permanent or impermanent?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.3">“Impermanent, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.4">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.5">“Suffering, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.6">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.8">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.9">“Is feeling permanent or impermanent?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.10">“Impermanent, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.11">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.12">“Suffering, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.13">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.15">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.16">“Is perception permanent or impermanent?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.17">“Impermanent, sir.” … </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.18">“Are choices permanent or impermanent?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.19">“Impermanent, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.20">“But if they’re impermanent, are they suffering or happiness?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.21">“Suffering, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.22">“But if they’re impermanent, suffering, and perishable, are they fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.24">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.25">“Is consciousness permanent or impermanent?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.26">“Impermanent, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.27">“But if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.28">“Suffering, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.29">“But if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:15.31">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:16.1">“So, Susīma, you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: <em>all</em> form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ You should truly see any kind of feeling at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: <em>all</em> feeling—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ You should truly see any kind of perception at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: <em>all</em> perception—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ You should truly see any kind of choices at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: <em>all choices</em>—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ You should truly see any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: <em>all</em> consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ </p>
<p id="sn12.70:17.1">Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. </p>
<p id="sn12.70:17.3">They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ </p>
<p id="sn12.70:18.1">Susīma, do you see that rebirth is a condition for old age and death?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:18.2">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:18.3">“Do you see that continued existence is a condition for rebirth?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:18.4">“Yes, sir.” </p>

<p id="sn12.70:19.5">“Do you see that when grasping ceases continued existence ceases … when craving ceases, grasping ceases … when feeling ceases, craving ceases … when contact ceases, feeling ceases … when the six sense fields cease, contact ceases … when name and form cease, the six sense fields cease … when consciousness ceases name and form cease … when choices cease consciousness ceases … when ignorance ceases choices cease?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:19.14">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:20.1">“But knowing and seeing thus, do you wield the many kinds of psychic power? …” </p>

<p id="sn12.70:27.1">Then Venerable Susīma bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet and said, “I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to go forth as a thief in such a well-explained teaching and training. Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:28.1">“Indeed, Susīma, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to go forth as a thief in such a well-explained teaching and training. Suppose they were to arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to the king, saying: ‘Your Majesty, this is a bandit, a criminal. Punish him as you will.’ The king would say: ‘Go, my men, and tie this man’s arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope. Shave his head and march him from street to street and from square to square to the beating of a harsh drum. Then take him out the south gate and there, to the south of the city, chop off his head.’ The king’s men would do as they were told. What do you think, Susīma? Wouldn’t that man experience pain and distress because of that?” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:28.9">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn12.70:29.1">“Although that man would experience pain and distress because of that, going forth as a thief in such a well-explained teaching and training has a more painful and bitter result. And it even leads to the underworld. But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it. For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.” </p>

<p id="sn12.67:1.2">Then in the late afternoon, Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita came out of retreat, went to Venerable Sāriputta, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Sāriputta: </p>
<p id="sn12.67:1.4">“Well, Reverend Sāriputta, are old age and death made by oneself? Or by another? Or by both oneself and another? Or do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?” </p>
<p id="sn12.67:1.5">“No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, old age and death are not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. Rather, rebirth is a condition for old age and death.” </p>

Or by another? Or by both oneself and another? Or do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?” </p>
<p id="sn12.67:3.8">“No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, name and form are not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. Rather, consciousness is a condition for name and form.” </p>

<p id="sn12.67:5.1">“Just now I understood you to say: ‘No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, name and form are not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. Rather, consciousness is a condition for name and form.’ </p>
<p id="sn12.67:6.1">But I also understood you to say: ‘No, Reverend Koṭṭhita, consciousness is not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor does it arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. Rather, name and form are conditions for consciousness.’ </p>
<p id="sn12.67:7.1">How then should we see the meaning of this statement?” </p>
<p id="sn12.67:7.2">“Well then, reverend, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said. Suppose there were two bundles of reeds leaning up against each other. </p>
<p id="sn12.67:7.5">In the same way, name and form are conditions for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. If the first of those bundles of reeds were to be pulled away, the other would collapse. And if the other were to be pulled away, the first would collapse. </p>
<p id="sn12.67:7.12">In the same way, when name and form cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.” </p>
<p id="sn12.67:8.1">“It’s incredible, Reverend Sāriputta, it’s amazing! How well spoken this was by Venerable Sāriputta! And we can express our agreement with Venerable Sāriputta’s statement on these thirty-six grounds. </p>
<p id="sn12.67:9.1">If a mendicant teaches Dhamma for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding old age and death, they’re qualified to be called a ‘mendicant who speaks on Dhamma’. If they practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding old age and death, they’re qualified to be called a ‘mendicant who practices in line with the teaching’. If they’re freed by not grasping by disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding old age and death, they’re qualified to be called a ‘mendicant who has attained extinguishment in this very life’. If a mendicant teaches Dhamma for disillusionment regarding rebirth … continued existence … grasping … craving … feeling … contact … the six sense fields … name and form … consciousness … choices … If a mendicant teaches Dhamma for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding ignorance, they’re qualified to be called a ‘mendicant who speaks on Dhamma’.

<p id="sn12.66:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>
<p id="sn12.66:1.5">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="sn12.66:1.7">“Mendicants, do you perform inner self-examination?” </p>
<p id="sn12.66:1.8">When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha, “Sir, I perform inner self-examination.” </p>
<p id="sn12.66:1.10">“But mendicant, how do you perform inner self-examination?” Then that mendicant answered, but the Buddha was not happy with the answer. </p>
<p id="sn12.66:2.1">When he had spoken, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, “Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! Let the Buddha speak of the inner self-examination. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” </p>
<p id="sn12.66:2.4">“Well then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="sn12.66:2.5">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="sn12.66:3.1">“Take a mendicant who performs inner self-examination: ‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms. But what is the source of this suffering? When what exists do old age and death come to be? And when what does not exist do old age and death not come to be?’ While examining they know: ‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms. The source of this suffering is attachment. When attachments exist old age and death come to be.

<p id="sn12.65:1.1">At Sāvatthī. </p>
<p id="sn12.65:1.2">“Mendicants, before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought: ‘Alas, this world has fallen into trouble. It’s born, grows old, dies, passes away, and is reborn, yet it doesn’t understand how to escape from this suffering, from old age and death. Oh, when will an escape be found from this suffering, from old age and death?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘When what exists is there old age and death? What is a condition for old age and death?’ Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: ‘When rebirth exists there’s old age and death. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’ </p>
<p id="sn12.65:2.1">Then it occurred to me: ‘When what exists is there rebirth? … continued existence … grasping … craving … feeling … contact … the six sense fields … name and form … What is a condition for name and form?’ Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: ‘When consciousness exists there are name and form. Consciousness is a condition for name and form.’ Then it occurred to me: ‘When what exists is there consciousness? What is a condition for consciousness?’ Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: ‘When name and form exist there’s consciousness. Name and form are a condition for consciousness.’ </p>
<p id="sn12.65:3.1">Then it occurred to me: This consciousness turns back from name and form, and doesn’t go beyond that. This is the extent to which one may be reborn, grow old, die, pass away, or reappear. That is: name and form are conditions for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. ‘Origination, origination.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another. </p>
<p id="sn12.65:4.1">Then it occurred to me: ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no old age and death? When what ceases do old age and death cease?’ Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: ‘When rebirth doesn’t exist there is no old age and death. When rebirth ceases old age and death cease.’ Then it occurred to me: ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no rebirth … continued existence … grasping … craving … feeling … contact … six sense fields … name and form? When what ceases do name and form cease?’ Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: ‘When consciousness doesn’t exist there is no name and form. When consciousness ceases name and form cease.’ </p>
<p id="sn12.65:5.1">Then it occurred to me: ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no consciousness? When what ceases does consciousness cease?’ Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: ‘When name and form don’t exist, there is no consciousness. When name and form cease, consciousness ceases.’ </p>
<p id="sn12.65:6.1">Then it occurred to me: I have discovered the path to awakening. That is: When name and form cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases. ‘Cessation, cessation.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another. </p>
<p id="sn12.65:7.1">Suppose a person was walking through a forest. They’d see an ancient path, an ancient route traveled by humans in the past. Following it along, they’d see an ancient city, an ancient capital, inhabited by humans in the past. It was lovely, complete with parks, groves, lotus ponds, and embankments. Then that person would inform a king or their minister: ‘Please sir, you should know this. While walking through a forest I saw an ancient path, an ancient route traveled by humans in the past. Following it along I saw an ancient city, an ancient capital, inhabited by humans in the past. It was lovely, complete with parks, groves, lotus ponds, and embankments. Sir, you should rebuild that city!’ Then that king or their minister would have that city rebuilt. And after some time that city was successful and prosperous and full of people, attained to growth and expansion. In the same way, I saw an ancient path, an ancient route traveled by fully awakened Buddhas in the past. </p>
<p id="sn12.65:8.1">And what is that ancient path, the ancient road traveled by fully awakened Buddhas in the past? It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. This is that ancient path, the ancient road traveled by fully awakened Buddhas in the past. </p>
<p id="sn12.65:8.5">Following it along, I directly knew old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation. Following it along, I directly knew rebirth … continued existence … grasping … craving … feeling … contact … the six sense fields … name and form … consciousness … Following it along, I directly knew choices, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation. </p>
<p id="sn12.65:8.24">Having directly known this, I told the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. And that’s how this spiritual life has become successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.” </p>

These are the four fuels that maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born. </p>
<p id="sn12.63:2.1">And how should you regard solid food? Suppose a couple who were husband and wife set out to cross a desert, taking limited supplies. They had an only child, dear and beloved. As the couple were crossing the desert their limited quantity of supplies would run out, and they’d still have the rest of the desert to cross. Then it would occur to that couple: ‘Our limited quantity of supplies has run out, and we still have the rest of the desert to cross. Why don’t we kill our only child, so dear and beloved, and prepare dried and spiced meat? Then we can make it across the desert by eating our child’s flesh. Let not all three perish.’ Then that couple would kill their only child, so dear and beloved, and prepare dried and spiced meat. They’d make it across the desert by eating their child’s flesh. And as they’d eat their child’s flesh, they’d beat their breasts and cry: ‘Where are you, our only child? Where are you, our only child?’ </p>
<p id="sn12.63:3.1">What do you think, mendicants? Would they eat that food for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration?” </p>
<p id="sn12.63:3.3">“No, sir.” </p>

<p id="sn12.63:3.5">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn12.63:3.6">“I say that this is how you should regard solid food. When solid food is completely understood, desire for the five kinds of sensual stimulation is completely understood.

<p id="sn12.63:4.1">And how should you regard contact as fuel? Suppose there was a flayed cow. If she stands by a wall, the creatures on the wall bite her.

Wherever that flayed cow stands, the creatures there would bite her. I say that this is how you should regard contact as fuel. When contact as fuel is completely understood, the three feelings are completely understood. When the three feelings are completely understood, a noble disciple has nothing further to do, I say. </p>
<p id="sn12.63:5.1">And how should you regard mental intention as fuel? Suppose there was a pit of glowing coals deeper than a man’s height, filled with glowing coals that neither flamed nor smoked. Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain. Then two strong men would grab them by the arms and drag them towards the pit of glowing coals. Then that person’s intention, aim, and wish would be to get far away. Why is that? Because that person would think: ‘If I fall in that pit of glowing coals, that will result in my death or deadly pain.’ I say that this is how you should regard mental intention as fuel.

Then late in the afternoon the king would say: ‘My men, how is that man?’ ‘He’s still alive, Your Majesty.’ The king would say: ‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the late afternoon with a hundred spears!’ The king’s men did as they were told. </p>

<p id="sn12.62:1.2">“Mendicants, when it comes to this body made up of the four primary elements, an unlearned ordinary person might become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed. Why is that? This body made up of the four primary elements is seen to accumulate and disperse, to be taken up and laid to rest. That’s why, when it comes to this body, an unlearned ordinary person might become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed. But when it comes to that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’, an unlearned ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned, dispassionate, or freed. Why is that? Because for a long time they’ve been attached to it, thought of it as their own, and mistaken it: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’ That’s why, when it comes to this mind, an unlearned ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed. </p>
<p id="sn12.62:2.1">But an unlearned ordinary person would be better off taking this body made up of the four primary elements to be their self, rather than the mind. Why is that? This body made up of the four primary elements is seen to last for a year, or for two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or a hundred years, or even longer. But that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all night. </p>
<p id="sn12.62:3.1">In this case, a learned noble disciple carefully and properly attends to dependent origination itself: ‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises. When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. That is: Pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant. With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant, the corresponding pleasant feeling ceases and stops. Painful feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as painful. With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as painful, the corresponding painful feeling ceases and stops. Neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutral. With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neutral, the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and stops. </p>
<p id="sn12.62:4.1">When you rub two sticks together, heat is generated and fire is produced. But when you part the sticks and lay them aside, any corresponding heat ceases and stops. In the same way, pleasant feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as pleasant. With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as pleasant, the corresponding pleasant feeling ceases and stops. Painful feeling … Neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutral. With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neutral, the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and stops. </p>
<p id="sn12.62:5.1">Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. </p>

In the same way, that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all night. </p>
<p id="sn12.61:5.1">In this case, a learned noble disciple carefully and properly attends to dependent origination itself: ‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises. When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. That is: Ignorance is a condition for choices. </p>
<p id="sn12.61:5.5">Choices are a condition for consciousness. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’ </p>
<p id="sn12.61:6.1">Seeing this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. </p>
<p id="sn12.61:6.3">They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’” </p>

<p id="sn12.60:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="sn12.60:1.3">“It’s incredible, sir! It’s amazing, in that this dependent origination is deep and appears deep, yet to me it seems as plain as can be.” </p>
<p id="sn12.60:2.1">“Not so, Ānanda! Not so, Ānanda! This dependent origination is deep and appears deep. It is because of not understanding and not penetrating this teaching that this population has become tangled like string, knotted like a ball of thread, and matted like rushes and reeds, and it doesn’t escape the places of loss, the bad places, the underworld, transmigration. </p>
<p id="sn12.60:3.1">There are things that are prone to being grasped. When you concentrate on the gratification provided by these things, your craving grows. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. </p>
<p id="sn12.60:4.1">Suppose there was a great tree. And its roots going downwards and across all draw the sap upwards. Fueled and sustained by that, the great tree would stand for a long time. </p>

<p id="sn12.60:6.1">Suppose there was a great tree. Then a person comes along with a spade and basket. They’d cut the tree down at the roots, dig them up, and pull them out, down to the fibers and stems. Then they’d split the tree apart, cut up the parts, and chop it into splinters. They’d dry the splinters in the wind and sun, burn them with fire, and reduce them to ashes. Then they’d winnow the ashes in a strong wind, or float them away down a swift stream. In this way the great tree is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. </p>

<p id="sn12.51:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>
<p id="sn12.51:1.5">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="sn12.51:2.1">“Mendicants, when a mendicant is inquiring, how do you define when they are inquiring for the complete ending of suffering?” </p>
<p id="sn12.51:2.2">“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” </p>
<p id="sn12.51:2.3">“Well then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="sn12.51:2.4">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="sn12.51:3.1">“Mendicants, take a mendicant who makes an inquiry: ‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms. What is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of this suffering? When what exists do old age and death come to be? When what does not exist do old age and death not come to be?’ While making an inquiry they understand: ‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms. The source of this suffering is rebirth. When rebirth exists, old age and death come to be. When rebirth doesn’t exist, old age and death don’t come to be.’ </p>
<p id="sn12.51:4.1">They understand old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for their cessation. And they practice in line with that path. This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of old age and death. </p>
<p id="sn12.51:5.1">Then they inquire further: ‘But what is the source of this rebirth? When what exists does rebirth come to be? And when what does not exist does rebirth not come to be?’ While making an inquiry they understand: ‘Continued existence is the source of rebirth. When continued existence exists, rebirth comes to be. When continued existence does not exist, rebirth doesn’t come to be.’ </p>
<p id="sn12.51:6.1">They understand rebirth, its origin, its cessation, and the fitting practice for its cessation. And they practice in line with that path. This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of rebirth. </p>
<p id="sn12.51:7.1">Then they inquire further: ‘But what is the source of this continued existence? …’ … ‘But what is the source of this grasping? …’ … ‘But what is the source of this craving? …’ … ‘But what is the source of this feeling? …’ … ‘But what is the source of this contact? …’ … ‘But what is the source of these six sense fields? …’ … ‘But what is the source of this name and form? …’ … ‘But what is the source of this consciousness? …’ … ‘But what is the source of these choices? When what exists do choices come to be? When what does not exist do choices not come to be?’ While making an inquiry they understand: ‘Ignorance is the source of choices. When ignorance exists, choices come to be. When ignorance does not exist, choices don’t come to be.’ </p>
<p id="sn12.51:8.1">They understand choices, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for their cessation. And they practice in line with that path. This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of choices. </p>
<p id="sn12.51:9.1">If an ignorant individual makes a good choice, their consciousness enters a good realm. If they make a bad choice, their consciousness enters a bad realm. If they make an imperturbable choice, their consciousness enters an imperturbable realm. When a mendicant has given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge, they don’t make a good choice, a bad choice, or an imperturbable choice. Not choosing or intending, they don’t grasp at anything in the world. Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished. </p>
<p id="sn12.51:9.7">They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ </p>
<p id="sn12.51:10.1">If they feel a pleasant feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. If they feel a painful feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. If they feel a neutral feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it detached. If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it detached. If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it detached. </p>
<p id="sn12.51:11.1">Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’ They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here. Only bodily remains will be left.’ </p>
<p id="sn12.51:12.1">Suppose a person were to remove a hot clay pot from a potter’s kiln and place it down on level ground. Its heat would dissipate right there, and the shards would be left behind. </p>
<p id="sn12.51:12.3">In the same way, feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’ They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here. Only bodily remains will be left.’ </p>
<p id="sn12.51:13.1">What do you think, mendicants? Would a mendicant who has ended the defilements still make good choices, bad choices, or imperturbable choices?” </p>
<p id="sn12.51:13.3">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn12.51:14.1">“And when there are no choices at all, with the cessation of choices, would consciousness still be found?” </p>
<p id="sn12.51:14.2">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="sn12.51:15.1">“And when there’s no consciousness at all, would name and form still be found?” </p>

<p id="sn12.32:1.1">At Sāvatthī. </p>
<p id="sn12.32:1.2">Then the mendicant Kaḷāra the Aristocrat went up to Venerable Sāriputta and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him, “Reverend Sāriputta, the mendicant Phagguna of the Top-Knot has resigned the training and returned to a lesser life.” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:1.5">“That venerable mustn’t have got any satisfaction in this teaching and training.” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:2.1">“Well then, has Venerable Sāriputta found satisfaction in this teaching and training?” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:3.1">“Reverend, I have no uncertainty.” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:3.2">“But what of the future?” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:4.1">“I have no doubt.” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:5.1">Then Kaḷāra the Aristocrat went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, Venerable Sāriputta has declared enlightenment: ‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:6.1">So the Buddha addressed a certain monk, “Please, monk, in my name tell Sāriputta that the teacher summons him.” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:6.4">“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Sāriputta and said to him, “Reverend Sāriputta, the teacher summons you.” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:6.6">“Yes, reverend,” replied Sāriputta. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, “Sāriputta, is it really true that you have declared enlightenment: ‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence”’?” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:6.9">“Sir, I did not state the matter in these words and phrases.” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:6.10">“Sāriputta, no matter how a gentleman declares enlightenment, what he has declared should be regarded as such.” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:6.11">“Sir, did I not also say that I did not state the matter in these words and phrases?” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:7.1">“Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you: ‘But Reverend Sāriputta, how have you known and seen so that you’ve declared enlightenment: “I understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”’ How would you answer?” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:8.1">“Sir, if they were to ask me this, I would answer: ‘Reverends, because of the ending of the source of rebirth, when it ended, I knew “it is ended”. Knowing this, I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:9.1">“But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you: ‘But what is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of rebirth?’ How would you answer?” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:9.4">“Sir, if they were to ask me this, I would answer: ‘Continued existence is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of rebirth.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:10.1">“But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you: ‘What is the source of continued existence?’ How would you answer?” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:10.4">“Sir, if they were to ask me this, I’d answer: ‘Grasping is the source of continued existence.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:11.1">“But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you: ‘What is the source of grasping?’ … But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you: ‘What is the source of craving?’ How would you answer?” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:11.6">“Sir, if they were to ask me this, I’d answer: ‘Feeling is the source of craving.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:12.1">“But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you: ‘But how have you known and seen so that the relishing of feelings is no longer present?’ How would you answer?” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:12.4">“Sir, if they were to ask me this, I’d answer: ‘Reverends, there are three feelings. What three? Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling. These three feelings are impermanent, and what’s impermanent is suffering. When I understood this, the relishing of feelings was no longer present.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:13.1">“Good, good, Sāriputta! The same point may also be briefly explained in this way: ‘Suffering includes whatever is felt.’ </p>
<p id="sn12.32:14.1">But Sāriputta, suppose they were to ask you: ‘But Reverend, how have you been released that you declare enlightenment: “I understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”?’ How would you answer?” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:14.5">“Sir, if they were to ask me this, I’d answer: ‘Because of an inner release with the ending of all grasping, I live mindfully so that defilements don’t defile me and I don’t look down on myself.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:15.1">“Good, good, Sāriputta! The same point may also be briefly explained in this way: ‘I have no uncertainty regarding the defilements spoken of by the ascetic. I have no doubt that I’ve given them up.’” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:15.4">That is what the Buddha said. When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. </p>
<p id="sn12.32:16.1">Then soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Sāriputta said to the mendicants, “Reverends, the first question that the Buddha asked me was something that I’d not previously considered, so I hesitated. But when the Buddha agreed with my answer, I thought: ‘If the Buddha were to question me all day on this matter in different words and ways, I could answer all day with different words and ways. If he were to question me all night, all day and night, for two days and nights, for three, four, five, six, or seven days and nights, I could answer in different words and ways for seven days and nights.’” </p>
<p id="sn12.32:17.1">Then Kaḷāra the Aristocrat went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, Venerable Sāriputta has roared his lion’s roar!” (And he told the Buddha all that Sāriputta had said.) </p>
<p id="sn12.32:18.1">“Mendicant, Sāriputta has clearly comprehended the principle of the teachings, so that he could answer any questions I might ask him in different words and ways up to the seventh day and night.” </p>

Such is feeling … Such is perception … Such are choices … Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ The ending of the defilements is for one who knows and sees this. </p>
<p id="sn12.23:2.1">I say that this knowledge of ending has a vital condition, it doesn’t lack a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Freedom.’ I say that freedom has a vital condition, it doesn’t lack a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Dispassion.’ I say that dispassion has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Disillusionment.’ I say that disillusionment has a vital condition. And what is it?

<p id="sn12.22:1.8">When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises. When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. That is: </p>
<p id="sn12.22:1.10">Ignorance is a condition for choices. </p>
<p id="sn12.22:1.11">Choices are a condition for consciousness. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases. </p>
<p id="sn12.22:2.1">So the teaching has been well explained by me, made clear, opened, illuminated, and stripped of patchwork. Just this much is quite enough for a gentleman who has gone forth out of faith to rouse up his energy. ‘Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and tendons remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.’ </p>
<p id="sn12.22:3.1">A lazy person lives in suffering, mixed up with bad, unskillful qualities, and ruins a great deal of their own good. An energetic person lives happily, secluded from bad, unskillful qualities, and fulfills a great deal of their own good. </p>
<p id="sn12.22:3.3">The best isn’t reached by the worst. The best is reached by the best. This spiritual life is the cream, mendicants, and the Teacher is before you. </p>
<p id="sn12.22:3.6">So you should rouse up energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized, thinking: ‘In this way our going forth will not be wasted, but will be fruitful and fertile. And our use of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick shall be of great fruit and benefit for those who offered them.’ That’s how you should train. </p>
<p id="sn12.22:3.10">Considering what is good for yourself, mendicants, is quite enough for you to persist with diligence. Considering what is good for others is quite enough for you to persist with diligence. Considering what is good for both is quite enough for you to persist with diligence.” </p>

<p id="sn12.20:1.4">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="sn12.20:2.1">“And what is dependent origination? Rebirth is a condition for old age and death. Whether Realized Ones arise or not, this law of nature persists, this regularity of natural principles, this invariance of natural principles, specific conditionality. A Realized One understands this and comprehends it, then he explains, teaches, asserts, establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals it. ‘Look,’ he says, ‘Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’ </p>
<p id="sn12.20:3.1">Continued existence is a condition for rebirth … Grasping is a condition for continued existence … Craving is a condition for grasping … </p>
<p id="sn12.20:3.4">Feeling is a condition for craving … Contact is a condition for feeling … The six sense fields are a condition for contact … Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields … </p>
<p id="sn12.20:3.8">Consciousness is a condition for name and form … </p>
<p id="sn12.20:3.9">Choices are a condition for consciousness … Ignorance is a condition for choices. Whether Realized Ones arise or not, this law of nature persists, this regularity of natural principles, this invariance of natural principles, specific conditionality. A Realized One understands this and comprehends it, then he explains, teaches, asserts, establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals it. ‘Look,’ he says, ‘Ignorance is a condition for choices.’ So the fact that this is real, not unreal, not otherwise; the specific conditionality of it: this is called dependent origination. </p>
<p id="sn12.20:4.1">And what are the dependently originated phenomena? Old age and death are impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated, liable to end, vanish, fade away, and cease. Rebirth … Continued existence … Grasping … Craving … </p>
<p id="sn12.20:4.7">Feeling … Contact … The six sense fields … Name and form … </p>
<p id="sn12.20:4.11">Consciousness … </p>
<p id="sn12.20:4.12">Choices … Ignorance is impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated, liable to end, vanish, fade away, and cease. These are called the dependently originated phenomena. </p>
<p id="sn12.20:5.1">When a noble disciple has clearly seen with right wisdom this dependent origination and these dependently originated phenomena as they are, it’s impossible for them to turn back to the past, thinking: ‘Did I exist in the past? Did I not exist in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? After being what, what did I become in the past?’ Or to turn forward to the future, thinking: ‘Will I exist in the future? Will I not exist in the future? What will I be in the future? How will I be in the future? After being what, what will I become in the future?’ Or to be undecided about the present, thinking: ‘Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? This sentient being—where did it come from? And where will it go?’ Why is that? Because that noble disciple has clearly seen with right wisdom this dependent origination and these dependently originated phenomena as they are.” </p>

<p id="sn12.17:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. </p>
<p id="sn12.17:1.3">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms. The naked ascetic Kassapa saw the Buddha coming off in the distance. He went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. </p>
<p id="sn12.17:1.6">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side, and said to the Buddha, </p>
<p id="sn12.17:1.7">“I’d like to ask Master Gotama about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.” </p>
<p id="sn12.17:1.8">“Kassapa, it’s the wrong time for questions. We’ve entered an inhabited area.” </p>

<p id="sn12.17:2.8">“I don’t want to ask much.” </p>
<p id="sn12.17:2.9">“Ask what you wish, Kassapa.” </p>

<p id="sn12.17:5.1">“Suppose that the person who does the deed experiences the result. Then for one who has existed since the beginning, suffering is made by oneself. This statement leans toward eternalism. Suppose that one person does the deed and another experiences the result. Then for one stricken by feeling, suffering is made by another. This statement leans toward annihilationism. Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way: ‘Ignorance is a condition for choices. </p>
<p id="sn12.17:5.5">Choices are a condition for consciousness. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’” </p>
<p id="sn12.17:6.1">When this was said, Kassapa said to the Buddha, “Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” </p>
<p id="sn12.17:7.1">“Kassapa, if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation. When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood. However, I have recognized individual differences.” </p>
<p id="sn12.17:8.1">“Sir, if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.” </p>
<p id="sn12.17:9.1">And the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. Not long after his ordination, Venerable Kassapa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="sn12.17:9.3">He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable Kassapa became one of the perfected. </p>

<p id="sn12.12:4.2">“That’s not a fitting question,” said the Buddha. </p>

<p id="sn11.3:9.1">But, mendicants, I say this: If you’ve gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut and you get scared or terrified, just recollect me: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ Then your fear and terror will go away. </p>
<p id="sn11.3:10.1">If you can’t recollect me, then recollect the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ Then your fear and terror will go away. </p>
<p id="sn11.3:11.1">If you can’t recollect the teaching, then recollect the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ Then your fear and terror will go away. </p>
<p id="sn11.3:12.1">Why is that? Because the Realized One is free of greed, hate, and delusion. He is fearless, brave, bold, and stands his ground.” </p>
<p id="sn11.3:12.3">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn11.3:13.1">“In the wilderness, at a tree’s root, <br/>or an empty hut, O mendicants, <br/>recollect the Buddha, <br/>and no fear will come to you. </p>
<p id="sn11.3:14.1">If you can’t recollect the Buddha—<br/>the eldest in the world, the chief of men—<br/>then recollect the teaching, <br/>emancipating, well taught. </p>
<p id="sn11.3:15.1">If you can’t recollect the teaching—<br/>emancipating, well taught—<br/>then recollect the Saṅgha, <br/>the supreme field of merit. </p>
<p id="sn11.3:16.1">Thus recollecting the Buddha, <br/>the teaching, and the Saṅgha, mendicants, <br/>fear and terror <br/>and goosebumps will be no more.” </p>

<p id="sn11.2:8.1">So, mendicants, even Sakka, lord of gods—while living off of the fruit of his good and bad deeds, and ruling as sovereign lord over these gods of the Thirty-Three—will speak in praise of initiative and energy.

<p id="sn10.12:1.17">Saying, “All right, sir,” the Buddha went in. </p>

<p id="sn10.12:1.20">“No, sir, I won’t get out. Do what you must.” </p>
<p id="sn10.12:1.22">“I will ask you a question, ascetic. If you don’t answer me, I’ll drive you insane, or explode your heart, or grab you by the feet and throw you to the far shore of the Ganges!” </p>
<p id="sn10.12:1.24">“I don’t see anyone in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans who could do that to me. But anyway, ask what you wish.” </p>

<p id="sn10.12:6.1">“How do you get wisdom? <br/>How do you earn wealth? <br/>How do you get a good reputation? <br/>How do you hold on to friends? <br/>How do the departed not grieve <br/>when passing from this world to the next?” </p>

<p id="sn10.12:8.1">Being responsible, acting appropriately, <br/>and working hard you earn wealth. <br/>Truthfulness wins you a good reputation. <br/>You hold on to friends by giving. <br/>That’s how the departed do not grieve <br/>when passing from this world to the next. </p>
<p id="sn10.12:9.1">A faithful householder <br/>who has these four qualities <br/>does not grieve after passing away: <br/>truth, principle, steadfastness, and generosity. </p>
<p id="sn10.12:10.1">Go ahead, ask others as well, <br/>there are many ascetics and brahmins. <br/>See whether anything better is found <br/>than truth, self-control, generosity, and patience.” </p>

<p id="sn10.8:1.5">Right away he wanted to go and see the Buddha, but he thought, “It’s too late to go and see the Buddha today. I’ll go and see him tomorrow.” He went to bed thinking of the Buddha. </p>
<p id="sn10.8:1.8">During the night he got up three times thinking it was morning. Then he approached the Sivaka Gate, and non-human beings opened it for him. </p>
<p id="sn10.8:1.11">But as he was leaving the city, light vanished and darkness appeared to him. He felt fear, terror, and goosebumps, and wanted to turn back. </p>

You have great wisdom, widespread wisdom, laughing wisdom, swift wisdom, sharp wisdom, penetrating wisdom.

In the same way, Sāriputta rightly keeps rolling the supreme Wheel of Dhamma that was rolled forth by me.” </p>

For of these five hundred monks, sixty have the three knowledges, sixty have the six direct knowledges, sixty are freed both ways, and the rest are freed by wisdom.” </p>
<p id="sn8.7:5.1">Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said, “I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!” </p>
<p id="sn8.7:5.3">“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha. </p>
<p id="sn8.7:5.4">Then Vaṅgīsa extolled the Buddha in his presence with fitting verses: </p>

<p id="sn8.7:6.1">“Today, on the fifteenth day sabbath, <br/>five hundred monks have gathered together <j>to purify their precepts. </j><br/>These untroubled sages <j>have cut off their fetters and bonds, </j><br/>they will not be reborn again. </p>
<p id="sn8.7:7.1">Just as a wheel-turning monarch <br/>surrounded by ministers <br/>travels all around this <br/>land that’s girt by sea. </p>
<p id="sn8.7:8.1">So disciples with the three knowledges, <br/>conquerors of death, <br/>revere the winner of the battle, <br/>the unsurpassed caravan leader. </p>

<p id="sn8.6:1.2">Now at that time Venerable Sāriputta was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk.

<p id="sn8.6:1.4">Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa thought, “This Venerable Sāriputta is educating the mendicants. … And those mendicants are paying heed, paying attention, engaging wholeheartedly, and lending an ear. Why don’t I extoll him in his presence with fitting verses?” </p>
<p id="sn8.6:2.1">Then Venerable Vaṅgīsa got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward Sāriputta, and said, “I feel inspired to speak, Reverend Sāriputta! I feel inspired to speak, Reverend Sāriputta!” </p>
<p id="sn8.6:2.3">“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said Sāriputta. </p>

<p id="sn8.5:2.1">“Mendicants, speech that has four factors is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It’s blameless and is not criticized by sensible people. What four? It’s when a mendicant speaks well, not poorly; they speak on the teaching, not against the teaching; they speak pleasantly, not unpleasantly; and they speak truthfully, not falsely. Speech with these four factors is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It’s blameless and is not criticized by sensible people.” </p>
<p id="sn8.5:2.5">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>

<p id="sn7.22:1.5">Then the Buddha approached that council. The brahmins and householders saw the Buddha coming off in the distance, and said, “Who are these shavelings, these fake ascetics? Don’t they understand the council rules?” </p>

<p id="sn7.22:2.1">“If good people are not present it is no true council; <br/>and those whose speak against principle <j>are not good people. </j><br/>Having given up greed, hate, and delusion, <br/>speakers of principle are good people.” </p>

<p id="sn7.22:3.1">When he had spoken, the brahmins and householders of Khomadussa said to the Buddha, “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<p id="sn7.21:1.2">Now at that time there was a brahmin named Saṅgārava staying in Sāvatthī. He practiced purification by water, believing in purification by water. He lived committed to the practice of immersing himself in water at dawn and dusk. Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. </p>
<p id="sn7.21:1.4">He wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, there is a brahmin named Saṅgārava staying in Sāvatthī. He practices purification by water, believing in purification by water. He lives committed to the practice of immersing himself in water at dawn and dusk. Please visit him at his home out of compassion.” The Buddha consented with silence. </p>
<p id="sn7.21:2.1">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the brahmin Saṅgārava, and sat down on the seat spread out. Then the brahmin Saṅgārava went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. </p>
<p id="sn7.21:2.3">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, “Is it really true, brahmin, that you practice purification by water, believing in purification by water; that you live committed to the practice of immersing yourself in water at dawn and dusk?” </p>
<p id="sn7.21:2.5">“Yes, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="sn7.21:2.6">“But brahmin, for what reason do you practice purification by water?” </p>
<p id="sn7.21:2.7">“It’s because, Master Gotama, whatever bad deeds I’ve done during the day I wash off by bathing at dusk; and whatever bad deeds I’ve done during the night, I wash off by bathing at dawn. That’s the reason why I practice purification by water.” </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn7.21:3.1">“The teaching is a lake with shores of ethics, brahmin, <br/>unclouded, praised by the fine to the good. <br/>There the knowledge masters go to bathe, <br/>and cross to the far shore without getting wet.” </p>

Not long after his ordination, Venerable Bhāradvāja, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life.

<p id="sn7.9:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying in the Kosalan lands on the bank of the Sundarikā river. </p>
<p id="sn7.9:1.2">Now at that time the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja was serving the sacred flame and performing the fire sacrifice on the bank of the Sundarikā. </p>
<p id="sn7.9:1.3">Then he looked all around the four quarters, wondering, “Now who might eat the leftovers of this offering?” </p>
<p id="sn7.9:1.5">He saw the Buddha meditating at the root of a certain tree with his robe pulled over his head. Taking the leftovers of the offering in his left hand and a pitcher in the right he approached the Buddha. When he heard Sundarikabhāradvāja’s footsteps the Buddha uncovered his head. </p>
<p id="sn7.9:1.8">Sundarikabhāradvāja thought, “This man is shaven, he is shaven!” And he wanted to turn back. </p>
<p id="sn7.9:1.9">But he thought, “Even some brahmins are shaven. Why don’t I go to him and ask about his birth?” </p>
<p id="sn7.9:2.1">Then the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja went up to the Buddha, and said to him, “Sir, in what caste were you born?” </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn7.9:3.1">“Don’t ask about birth, ask about conduct; <br/>for any kindling can kindle a flame. <br/>A steadfast sage, even though from a low class family, <br/>is a thoroughbred checked by conscience. </p>
<p id="sn7.9:4.1">Tamed by truth, fulfilled by taming, <br/>a complete knowledge master <j>who has completed the spiritual journey—</j><br/>that’s who a sacrificer <j>should introduce themselves to, </j><br/>and make a timely offering <j>to one worthy of a religious donation.” </j></p>
<p id="sn7.9:5.1">“My sacrificial offering <j>must have been well performed, </j><br/>since I have met such a knowledge master! <br/>It’s because I’d never met anyone like you <br/>that others ate the leftover offering. </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="sn7.9:6.1">Eat, Master Gotama, you are truly a brahmin.” </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn7.9:7.1">“Food enchanted by a spell isn’t fit for me to eat. <br/>That’s not the principle of those who see, brahmin. <br/>The Buddhas reject things enchanted with spells. <br/>Since there is such a principle, brahmin, <j>that’s how they live. </j></p>
<p id="sn7.9:8.1">Serve with other food and drink <br/>the consummate one, the great hermit, <br/>with defilements ended and remorse stilled. <br/>For he is the field for the seeker of merit.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="sn7.9:9.1">“Then, Master Gotama, to whom should I give the leftovers of this offering?” </p>
<p id="sn7.9:9.2">“Brahmin, I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who can properly digest these leftovers, except for the Realized One or one of his disciples. Well then, brahmin, throw out those leftovers where there is little that grows, or drop them into water that has no living creatures.” </p>
<p id="sn7.9:10.1">So Sundarikabhāradvāja dropped the leftover offering in water that had no living creatures. And when those leftovers were placed in the water, they sizzled and hissed, steaming and fuming. Suppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day. If you placed it in the water, it would sizzle and hiss, steaming and fuming. In the same way, when those leftovers were placed in the water, they sizzled and hissed, steaming and fuming. </p>
<p id="sn7.9:11.1">Then the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja, shocked and awestruck, went up to the Buddha, and stood to one side. The Buddha addressed him in verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn7.9:12.1">“When you’re kindling the wood, brahmin, <br/>don’t imagine this is purity, for it’s just an external. <br/>For experts say this is no way to purity, <br/>when one seeks purity in externals. </p>
<p id="sn7.9:13.1">I’ve given up kindling firewood, brahmin, <br/>now I just light the inner flame. <br/>Always blazing, always serene, <br/>I am a perfected one leading the spiritual life. </p>
<p id="sn7.9:14.1">Conceit, brahmin, is the burden of your possessions, <br/>anger your smoke, and lies your ashes. <br/>The tongue is the ladle and the heart the fire altar; <br/>a well-tamed self is a person’s light. </p>
<p id="sn7.9:15.1">The teaching is a lake with shores of ethics, brahmin, <br/>unclouded, praised by the fine to the good. <br/>There the knowledge masters go to bathe, <br/>and cross to the far shore without getting wet. </p>
<p id="sn7.9:16.1">Truth, principle, restraint, the spiritual life; <br/>the attainment of the supreme based on the middle, <j>brahmin. </j><br/>Pay homage to the upright ones—<br/>I declare that man to be <j>one who follows the teaching.” </j></p>
</blockquote>

<p id="sn6.15:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying between a pair of sal trees in the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near Kusinārā at the time of his final extinguishment. </p>
<p id="sn6.15:1.2">Then the Buddha said to the mendicants: “Come now, mendicants, I say to you all: ‘Conditions fall apart. Persist with diligence.’” </p>
<p id="sn6.15:1.5">These were the Realized One’s last words. </p>
<p id="sn6.15:2.1">Then the Buddha entered the first absorption. Emerging from that, he entered the second absorption. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the third absorption, the fourth absorption, the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness, and the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Then he entered the cessation of perception and feeling. </p>
<p id="sn6.15:3.1">Then he emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling and entered the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the dimension of nothingness, the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of infinite space, the fourth absorption, the third absorption, the second absorption, and the first absorption. Emerging from that, he successively entered into and emerged from the second absorption and the third absorption. Then he entered the fourth absorption. Emerging from that the Buddha immediately became fully extinguished. </p>
<p id="sn6.15:3.2">When the Buddha became fully extinguished, along with the full extinguishment, Brahmā Sahampati recited this verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn6.15:4.1">“All creatures in this world <br/>must lay down this bag of bones. <br/>For even a Teacher such as this, <br/>unrivaled in the world, <br/>the Realized One, attained to power, <br/>the Buddha became fully extinguished.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="sn6.15:5.1">When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Sakka, lord of gods, recited this verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn6.15:6.1">“Oh! Conditions are impermanent, <br/>their nature is to rise and fall; <br/>having arisen, they cease; <br/>their stilling is true bliss.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="sn6.15:7.1">When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Venerable Ānanda recited this verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn6.15:8.1">“Then there was terror! <br/>Then they had goosebumps! <br/>When the Buddha, endowed with all fine qualities, <br/>became fully extinguished.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="sn6.15:9.1">When the Buddha became fully extinguished, Venerable Anuruddha recited this verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn6.15:10.1">“There was no more breathing <br/>for the poised one of steady heart. <br/>Imperturbable, committed to peace, <br/>the seer became fully extinguished. </p>
<p id="sn6.15:11.1">He put up with painful feelings <br/>without flinching. <br/>The liberation of his heart <br/>was like the extinguishing of a lamp.” </p>

<p id="sn6.14:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī. There he addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>
<p id="sn6.14:1.5">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="sn6.14:2.1">“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a king named Aruṇavā. He had a capital named Aruṇavatī. Sikhī the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha lived supported by Aruṇavatī. Sikhī had a fine pair of chief disciples named Abhibhū and Sambhava. </p>
<p id="sn6.14:2.5">Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū, ‘Come, brahmin, let’s go to one of the brahmā realms until it’s time for our meal.’ </p>
<p id="sn6.14:2.7">‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, they vanished from Aruṇavatī and appeared in that Brahmā realm. </p>
<p id="sn6.14:3.1">Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū, ‘Brahmin, teach the Dhamma as you feel inspired for that Brahmā, his assembly, and the members of his retinue.’ </p>
<p id="sn6.14:3.3">‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Then he educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk. </p>
<p id="sn6.14:3.4">But the Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue complained, grumbled, and objected, ‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! How on earth can a disciple teach Dhamma in the presence of the Teacher?’ </p>
<p id="sn6.14:4.1">Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicant Abhibhū, ‘Brahmin, Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue are complaining that a disciple teaches Dhamma in the presence of the Teacher. Well then, brahmin, stir them up even more!’ </p>
<p id="sn6.14:4.5">‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Then he taught Dhamma with his body visible; with his body invisible; with the lower half visible and the upper half invisible; and with the upper half visible and the lower half invisible. </p>
<p id="sn6.14:4.6">And the Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue, their minds full of wonder and amazement, thought, ‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! The ascetic has such psychic power and might!’ </p>
<p id="sn6.14:5.1">Then Abhibhū said to the Buddha Sikhī, ‘Sir, I recall having said this in the middle of the Saṅgha: “Standing in the Brahmā realm, I can make my voice heard throughout the galaxy.”’ </p>
<p id="sn6.14:5.4">‘Now is the time, brahmin! Now is the time, brahmin! Standing in the Brahmā realm, make your voice heard throughout the galaxy.’ </p>
<p id="sn6.14:5.6">‘Yes, sir,’ replied Abhibhū. Standing in the Brahmā realm, he recited this verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn6.14:6.1">‘Rouse yourselves! Try harder! <br/>Devote yourselves to the teachings of the Buddha! <br/>Crush the army of Death, <br/>as an elephant a hut of reeds. </p>
<p id="sn6.14:7.1">Whoever shall meditate diligently <br/>in this teaching and training, <br/>giving up transmigration through rebirths, <br/>will make an end of suffering.’ </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="sn6.14:8.1">Having inspired that Brahmā, his assembly, and his retinue with a sense of awe, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, Sikhī and Abhibhū vanished from that Brahmā realm and appeared in Aruṇavatī. </p>
<p id="sn6.14:8.3">Then the Buddha Sikhī addressed the mendicants, ‘Mendicants, did you hear the mendicant Abhibhū speaking a verse while standing in a Brahmā realm?’ </p>
<p id="sn6.14:8.5">‘We did, sir.’ </p>
<p id="sn6.14:8.6">‘But what exactly did you hear?’ </p>
<p id="sn6.14:8.7">‘This is what we heard, sir: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn6.14:9.1">“Rouse yourselves! Try harder! <br/>Devote yourselves to the teachings of the Buddha! <br/>Crush the army of Death, <br/>as an elephant a hut of reeds. </p>
<p id="sn6.14:10.1">Whoever shall meditate diligently <br/>in this teaching and training, <br/>giving up transmigration through rebirths, <br/>will make an end of suffering.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="sn6.14:11.1">That’s what we heard, sir.’ </p>
<p id="sn6.14:11.2">‘Good, good, mendicants! It’s good that you heard the mendicant Abhibhū speaking this verse while standing in a Brahmā realm.’” </p>
<p id="sn6.14:12.1">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. </p>

<p id="sn6.13:1.2">Now at that time the Buddha was meditating in the open during the dark of night, while a gentle rain drizzled down. </p>
<p id="sn6.13:1.3">Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati, lighting up the entirety of Andhakavinda, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and recited these verses in the Buddha’s presence: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn6.13:2.1">“One should frequent secluded lodgings, <br/>and practice to be released from fetters. <br/>If you don’t find enjoyment there, <br/>live in the Saṅgha, guarded and mindful. </p>
<p id="sn6.13:3.1">Walking for alms from family to family, <br/>with senses guarded, alert and mindful. <br/>One should frequent secluded lodgings, <br/>free of fear, freed in the fearless. </p>
<p id="sn6.13:4.1">Where dreadful serpents slither, <br/>where the lightning flashes and the sky thunders <br/>in the dark of the night; <br/>there meditates a mendicant, free of goosebumps. </p>
<p id="sn6.13:5.1">For this has in fact been seen by me, <br/>it isn’t just what the testament says. <br/>Within a single spiritual dispensation <br/>a thousand are conquerors of Death. </p>
<p id="sn6.13:6.1">And of trainees there are more than five hundred, <br/>and ten times ten tens; <br/>all are stream-enterers, <br/>freed from rebirth in the animal realm. </p>
<p id="sn6.13:7.1">And as for the rest of folk <br/>who I think have shared in merit—<br/>I couldn’t even number them, <br/>for fear of speaking falsely.” </p>

<p id="sn6.10:1.1">At Sāvatthī. </p>
<p id="sn6.10:1.2">Then the mendicant Kokālika went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have corrupt wishes. They’ve fallen under the sway of corrupt wishes.” </p>
<p id="sn6.10:1.4">When this was said, the Buddha said to Kokālika, “Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.” </p>
<p id="sn6.10:1.7">For a second time Kokālika said to the Buddha, “Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have corrupt wishes. They’ve fallen under the sway of corrupt wishes.” </p>
<p id="sn6.10:1.9">For a second time, the Buddha said to Kokālika, “Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.” </p>
<p id="sn6.10:1.12">For a third time Kokālika said to the Buddha, “Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have corrupt wishes. They’ve fallen under the sway of corrupt wishes.” </p>
<p id="sn6.10:1.14">For a third time, the Buddha said to Kokālika, “Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.” </p>
<p id="sn6.10:2.1">Then Kokālika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. Not long after he left his body erupted with boils the size of mustard seeds. The boils grew to the size of mung beans, then chickpeas, then jujube seeds, then jujubes, then myrobalans, then unripe wood apples, then ripe wood apples. Finally they burst open, and pus and blood oozed out. Then the mendicant Kokālika died of that illness. He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna. </p>
<p id="sn6.10:3.1">Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, “Sir, the mendicant Kokālika has passed away. He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.” </p>
<p id="sn6.10:3.4">That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there. </p>
<p id="sn6.10:4.1">Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened. </p>
<p id="sn6.10:5.1">When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha, “Sir, how long is the life span in the Pink Lotus hell?” </p>
<p id="sn6.10:5.3">“It’s long, mendicant. It’s not easy to calculate how many years, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts.” </p>
<p id="sn6.10:5.6">“But sir, is it possible to give a simile?” </p>
<p id="sn6.10:5.7">“It’s possible,” said the Buddha. </p>
<p id="sn6.10:6.1">“Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed. And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed from it. By this means the Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell. </p>
<p id="sn6.10:6.3">Now, twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Nirabbuda hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Nirabbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Ababa hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Ababa hell equal one lifetime in the Aṭaṭa hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Aṭaṭa hell equal one lifetime in the Ahaha hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Ahaha hell equal one lifetime in the Yellow Lotus hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Yellow Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Sweet-Smelling hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Sweet-Smelling hell equal one lifetime in the Blue Water Lily hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Blue Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the White Lotus hell. Twenty lifetimes in the White Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Pink Lotus hell. </p>
<p id="sn6.10:6.12">The mendicant Kokālika has been reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.” </p>
<p id="sn6.10:6.13">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>

<p id="sn6.5:1.4">Then the Buddha knew what that Brahmā was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm. Then the Buddha sat cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element. </p>
<p id="sn6.5:2.1">Then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thought, “Where is the Buddha staying at present?” With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, he saw the Buddha seated cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element. Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm. Then Mahāmoggallāna—positioning himself in the east, below the Buddha—sat cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element. </p>
<p id="sn6.5:3.1">Then Venerable Mahākassapa … positioned himself in the south … </p>
<p id="sn6.5:4.1">Venerable Mahākappina … positioned himself in the west … </p>
<p id="sn6.5:5.1">Venerable Anuruddha … positioned himself in the north, below the Buddha, sitting cross-legged in the air above that Brahmā, having entered upon the fire element. </p>
<p id="sn6.5:6.1">Then Mahāmoggallāna addressed that Brahmā in verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn6.5:7.1">“Sir, do you still have the same view <br/>that you had in the past? <br/>Or do you see the radiance <br/>transcending the Brahmā realm?” </p>
<p id="sn6.5:8.1">“Good sir, I don’t have that view <br/>that I had in the past. <br/>I see the radiance <br/>transcending the Brahmā realm. <br/>So how could I say today <br/>that I am permanent and eternal?” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="sn6.5:9.1">Having inspired a sense of awe in the Brahmā, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, the Buddha vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in Jeta’s Grove. </p>
<p id="sn6.5:9.2">Then that Brahmā addressed a member of his retinue, “Please, good sir, go up to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and say to him: ‘Moggallāna my good sir, are there any other disciples of the Buddha who have power and might comparable to the masters Moggallāna, Kassapa, Kappina, and Anuruddha?’” </p>
<p id="sn6.5:9.6">“Yes, good sir,” replied that retinue member. He went to Moggallāna and asked as instructed. </p>
<p id="sn6.5:9.9">Then Mahāmoggallāna addressed that member of Brahmā’s retinue in verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn6.5:10.1">“There are many disciples of the Buddha <br/>who have the three knowledges, <br/>and have attained psychic power, <j>expert in reading minds, </j><br/>they’re perfected ones with defilements ended.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="sn6.5:11.1">Then that member of Brahmā’s retinue, having approved and agreed with what Mahāmoggallāna said, went to that Brahmā and said to him, “Good sir, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn6.5:12.1">‘There are many disciples of the Buddha <br/>who have the three knowledges, <br/>and have attained psychic power, <j>expert in reading minds, </j><br/>they’re perfected ones with defilements ended.’” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="sn6.5:13.1">That’s what that member of Brahmā’s retinue said. Satisfied, that Brahmā was happy with what the member of his retinue said. </p>

<p id="sn6.4:1.3">Now at that time Baka the Brahmā had the following harmful misconception: “This is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is whole, this is imperishable. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.” </p>
<p id="sn6.4:2.1">Then the Buddha knew what Baka the Brahmā was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm. </p>
<p id="sn6.4:2.2">Baka the Brahmā saw the Buddha coming off in the distance and said to him, “Come, good sir! Welcome, good sir! It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here. For this is permanent, this is everlasting, this is eternal, this is complete, this is imperishable. For this is where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And there’s no other escape beyond this.” </p>
<p id="sn6.4:3.1">When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him, “Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance! Alas, Baka the Brahmā is lost in ignorance! Because what is actually impermanent, not lasting, transient, incomplete, and perishable, he says is permanent, everlasting, eternal, complete, and imperishable. And where there is being born, growing old, dying, passing away, and being reborn, he says that there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. And although there is another escape beyond this, he says that there’s no other escape beyond this.” </p>

<p id="sn6.4:5.1">“But, Baka, the life span here is short, not long, <br/>though you think it’s long. <br/>I know that your life span <br/>is two quinquadecillion years, Brahmā.” </p>

<p id="sn6.3:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>
<p id="sn6.3:1.3">Now at that time a certain brahmin lady had a son called Brahmadeva, who had gone forth from the lay life to homelessness in the presence of the Buddha. </p>
<p id="sn6.3:2.1">Then Venerable Brahmadeva, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="sn6.3:2.2">He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable Brahmadeva became one of the perfected. </p>
<p id="sn6.3:3.1">Then Brahmadeva robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Wandering indiscriminately for almsfood in Sāvatthī, he approached his own mother’s home. </p>
<p id="sn6.3:3.3">Now at that time Brahmadeva’s mother, the brahmin lady, was offering up a regular oblation to Brahmā. </p>
<p id="sn6.3:3.4">Then Brahmā Sahampati thought, “This Venerable Brahmadeva’s mother, the brahmin lady, offers up a regular oblation to Brahmā. Why don’t I go and stir up a sense of urgency in her?” </p>
<p id="sn6.3:3.7">Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in the home of Brahmadeva’s mother. Then Brahmā Sahampati, while standing in the air, addressed Brahmadeva’s mother in verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn6.3:4.1">“Far from here is the Brahmā realm, madam, <br/>to which you offer a regular oblation. <br/>But Brahmā doesn’t eat that kind of food. <br/>Why pray, when you don’t know the path to Brahmā? </p>
<p id="sn6.3:5.1">This Brahmadeva, madam, <br/>free of attachments, has surpassed the gods. <br/>Owning nothing, providing for no other, <j>a mendicant </j><br/>has entered your house for alms. </p>
<p id="sn6.3:6.1">He’s worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, <j>a knowledge master, evolved. </j><br/>He’s worthy of a religious donation <j>from gods and men. </j><br/>Having banished all evils, he’s unsullied. <br/>Cool at heart, he wanders searching for food. </p>
<p id="sn6.3:7.1">He has no before and after, <br/>peaceful, unclouded, untroubled, <j>with no need for hope, </j><br/>he has laid down the rod <j>for all creatures firm and frail. </j><br/>So let him enjoy your offering of choice alms. </p>
<p id="sn6.3:8.1">With peaceful mind, he has left the crowd, <br/>he wanders like a tamed elephant, unperturbed. <br/>He’s a mendicant fair in ethics, with heart well freed. <br/>So let him enjoy your offering of choice alms. </p>
<p id="sn6.3:9.1">With unwavering confidence in him, <br/>present your religious donation <j>to one who is worthy of it. </j><br/>Now that you’ve seen the sage who has crossed over, <j>madam, </j><br/>make merit for the sake of future happiness!” </p>

<p id="sn6.2:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. </p>
<p id="sn6.2:1.3">Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, “It’s unpleasant to live without respect and reverence. What ascetic or brahmin should I honor and respect and rely on?” </p>
<p id="sn6.2:2.1">Then it occurred to him: </p>
<p id="sn6.2:2.2">“I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of ethics, if it were incomplete. But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who is more accomplished than myself in ethics, who I should honor and respect and rely on. </p>
<p id="sn6.2:3.1">I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of immersion, if it were incomplete. But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in immersion … </p>

<p id="sn6.2:5.1">I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of freedom, if it were incomplete. But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in freedom … </p>
<p id="sn6.2:6.1">I’d honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of the knowledge and vision of freedom, if it were incomplete. But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who is more accomplished than myself in the knowledge and vision of freedom, who I should honor and respect and rely on. Why don’t I honor and respect and rely on the same Dhamma to which I was awakened?” </p>
<p id="sn6.2:7.1">Then Brahmā Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: </p>
<p id="sn6.2:7.3">“That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past honored and respected and relied on this same teaching. All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future will honor and respect and rely on this same teaching. May the Blessed One, who is the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present, also honor and respect and rely on this same teaching.” </p>
<p id="sn6.2:7.7">This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he went on to say: </p>

<h5 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">SN 6.1</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">The Appeal of Brahmā </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Brahmāyācanasutta</span></h5>
<p id="sn6.1:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near Uruvelā at the root of the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. </p>
<p id="sn6.1:1.3">Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, “This principle I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute. But people like attachment, they love it and enjoy it. It’s hard for them to see this thing; that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination. It’s also hard for them to see this thing; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment. And if I were to teach this principle, others might not understand me, which would be wearying and troublesome for me.” </p>
<p id="sn6.1:1.9">And then these verses, which were neither supernaturally inspired, nor learned before in the past, occurred to the Buddha: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn6.1:2.1">“I’ve struggled hard to realize this, <br/>enough with trying to explain it! <br/>This principle is not easily understood <br/>by those mired in greed and hate. </p>
<p id="sn6.1:3.1">Those besotted by greed can’t see <br/>what’s subtle, going against the stream, <br/>deep, hard to see, and very fine, <br/>for they’re veiled in a mass of darkness.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="sn6.1:4.1">And as the Buddha reflected like this, his mind inclined to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma. </p>
<p id="sn6.1:5.1">Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what the Buddha was thinking, thought, “Oh my goodness! The world will be lost, the world will perish! For the mind of the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, inclines to remaining passive, not to teaching the Dhamma.” </p>
<p id="sn6.1:5.3">Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: </p>
<p id="sn6.1:5.5">“Sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the Holy One teach the Dhamma! There are beings with little dust in their eyes. They’re in decline because they haven’t heard the teaching. There will be those who understand the teaching!” </p>
<p id="sn6.1:5.8">This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he went on to say: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn6.1:6.1">“Among the Magadhans there appeared in the past <br/>an impure teaching thought up by those still stained. <br/>Fling open the door to the deathless! <br/>Let them hear the teaching <j>the immaculate one discovered. </j></p>
<p id="sn6.1:7.1">Standing high on a rocky mountain, <br/>you can see the people all around. <br/>In just the same way, all-seer, wise one, <br/>having ascended the Temple of Truth, <br/>rid of sorrow, look upon the people <br/>swamped with sorrow,  <j>oppressed by rebirth and old age. </j></p>
<p id="sn6.1:8.1">Rise, hero! Victor in battle, leader of the caravan, <br/>wander the world without obligation. <br/>Let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! <br/>There will be those who understand!” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="sn6.1:9.1">Then the Buddha, understanding Brahmā’s invitation, surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha, because of his compassion for sentient beings. And the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not. </p>
<p id="sn6.1:9.3">It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. Some of them sprout and grow in the water reaching the water’s surface. And some of them sprout and grow in the water but rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to them. </p>
<p id="sn6.1:9.4">In the same way, the Buddha saw sentient beings with little dust in their eyes, and some with much dust in their eyes; with keen faculties and with weak faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach. And some of them lived seeing the danger in the fault to do with the next world, while others did not. </p>
<p id="sn6.1:9.5">When he had seen this he replied in verse to Brahmā Sahampati: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn6.1:10.1">“Flung open are the doors to the deathless! <br/>Let those with ears to hear commit to faith. <br/>Thinking it would be troublesome, Brahmā, <j>I did not teach </j><br/>the sophisticated, sublime Dhamma among humans.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="sn6.1:11.1">Then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing that his request for the Buddha to teach the Dhamma had been granted, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there. </p>

<p id="sn5.10:1.2">Then the nun Vajirā robed up in the morning and, taking her bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. She wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on her return from almsround, she went to the Dark Forest, plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation. </p>
<p id="sn5.10:1.5">Then Māra the Wicked, wanting to make the nun Vajirā feel fear, terror, and goosebumps, wanting to make her fall away from immersion, went up to her and addressed her in verse: </p>

<p id="sn3.25:1.1">At Sāvatthī. </p>
<p id="sn3.25:1.2">King Pasenadi of Kosala sat to one side, and the Buddha said to him, “So, great king, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?” </p>
<p id="sn3.25:1.4">“Sir, there are anointed aristocratic kings who are infatuated with authority, and obsessed with greed for sensual pleasures. They have attained stability in the country, occupying a vast conquered territory. Today I have been busy fulfilling the duties of such kings.” </p>
<p id="sn3.25:2.1">“What do you think, great king? Suppose a trustworthy and reliable man were to come from the east. He’d approach you and say: ‘Please sir, you should know this. I come from the east. There I saw a huge mountain that reached the clouds. And it was coming this way, crushing all creatures. So then, great king, do what you must!’ </p>
<p id="sn3.25:2.7">Then a second trustworthy and reliable man were to come from the west … a third from the north … and a fourth from the south. He’d approach you and say: ‘Please sir, you should know this. I come from the south. There I saw a huge mountain that reached the clouds. And it was coming this way, crushing all creatures. So then, great king, do what you must!’ </p>
<p id="sn3.25:2.14">Should such a dire threat arise—a terrible loss of human life, when human birth is so rare—what would you do?” </p>
<p id="sn3.25:3.1">“Sir, what could I do but practice the teachings, practice morality, doing skillful and good actions?” </p>
<p id="sn3.25:4.1">“I tell you, great king, I announce to you: old age and death are advancing upon you. Since old age and death are advancing upon you, what would you do?” </p>
<p id="sn3.25:4.3">“Sir, what can I do but practice the teachings, practice morality, doing skillful and good actions? </p>
<p id="sn3.25:4.4">Sir, there are anointed aristocratic kings who are infatuated with authority, and obsessed with greed for sensual pleasures. They have attained stability in the country, occupying a vast conquered territory. Such kings engage in battles of elephants, cavalry, chariots, or infantry. But there is no place, no scope for such battles when old age and death are advancing. </p>
<p id="sn3.25:4.11">In this royal court there are ministers of wise counsel who are capable of dividing an approaching enemy by wise counsel. But there is no place, no scope for such diplomatic battles when old age and death are advancing. </p>
<p id="sn3.25:4.13">In this royal court there is abundant gold coin and bullion stored in dungeons and towers. Using this wealth we can bribe an approaching enemy. But there is no place, no scope for such monetary battles when old age and death are advancing. </p>
<p id="sn3.25:4.15">When old age and death are advancing, what can I do but practice the teachings, practice morality, doing skillful and good actions?” </p>
<p id="sn3.25:5.1">“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true! When old age and death are advancing, what can you do but practice the teachings, practice morality, doing skillful and good actions?” </p>
<p id="sn3.25:5.3">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>

<p id="sn3.25:6.1">“Suppose there were vast mountains <br/>of solid rock touching the sky <br/>drawing in from all sides <br/>and crushing the four quarters. </p>
<p id="sn3.25:7.1">So too old age and death <br/>advance upon all living creatures—<br/>aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, <br/>menials, outcastes, and scavengers. <br/>They spare nothing. <br/>They crush all beneath them. </p>
<p id="sn3.25:8.1">There’s nowhere for elephants to take a stand, <br/>nor chariots nor infantry. <br/>They can’t be defeated <br/>by diplomatic battles or by wealth. </p>
<p id="sn3.25:9.1">That’s why an astute person, <br/>seeing what’s good for themselves, <br/>being wise, would place faith <br/>in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha. </p>
<p id="sn3.25:10.1">Whoever lives by the teaching <br/>in body, speech, and mind, <br/>is praised in this life <br/>and departs to rejoice in heaven.” </p>

<p id="sn3.24:1.5">“But sir, where is a gift very fruitful?” </p>
<p id="sn3.24:1.6">“Where a gift should be given is one thing, great king, but where a gift is very fruitful is another. A gift is very fruitful when it’s given to an ethical person, not so much to an unethical person. Well then, great king, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. </p>
<p id="sn3.24:1.9">What do you think, great king? Suppose you were at war, ready to fight a battle. Then along comes an aristocrat youth who is untrained, inexpert, unfit, inexperienced. And he’s fearful, scared, nervous, quick to flee. Would you employ such a man? Would he be of any use to you?” </p>
<p id="sn3.24:1.13">“No, sir, I would have no use for such a man.” </p>
<p id="sn3.24:1.14">“What about a brahmin youth, a peasant youth, or a menial youth who was similar?” </p>
<p id="sn3.24:1.17">“No, sir, I would have no use for such a man.” </p>
<p id="sn3.24:2.1">“What do you think, great king? Suppose you were at war, ready to fight a battle. Then along comes an aristocrat youth who is trained, expert, fit, experienced. And he’s fearless, brave, bold, standing his ground. Would you employ such a man? Would he be of any use to you?” </p>

<p id="sn3.24:2.10">“Yes, sir, I would have a use for such a man.” </p>
<p id="sn3.24:3.1">“In the same way, a gift to anyone who has given up five factors and possesses five factors is very fruitful, no matter what family they’ve gone forth from. </p>
<p id="sn3.24:3.2">What are the five factors they’ve given up? Sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. These are the five factors they’ve given up. </p>
<p id="sn3.24:3.5">What are the five factors they possess? The entire spectrum of an adept’s ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and knowledge and vision of freedom. These are the five factors they possess. </p>
<p id="sn3.24:3.8">I say that a gift to anyone who has given up these five factors and possesses these five factors is very fruitful.” </p>
<p id="sn3.24:3.9">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn3.24:4.1">“Any youth skilled at archery, <br/>powerful and vigorous, <br/>would be employed by a king going to war—<br/>one is not a coward by reason of birth. </p>
<p id="sn3.24:5.1">Just so, whoever is settled <br/>in the qualities of patience and gentleness, <br/>a clever person with noble conduct, <br/>should be venerated even if they’re low born. </p>
<p id="sn3.24:6.1">You should build lovely hermitages <br/>and settle learned people in them. <br/>You should set up water supplies in barren regions <br/>and passages in places hard to travel. </p>
<p id="sn3.24:7.1">Food, drink, edibles, <br/>clothes, and lodgings <br/>should be given to the upright ones, <br/>with a clear and confident heart. </p>

<p id="sn3.24:9.1">So too an astute person, <br/>faithful and learned, <br/>should prepare a meal to satisfy <br/>renunciates with food and drink. </p>
<p id="sn3.24:10.1">Rejoicing, they strew gifts about, <br/>crying ‘Give! give!’ <br/>For that is their thunder, <br/>like the gods when it rains. <br/>That stream of merit so abundant <br/>showers down on the giver.” </p>

But because that financier regretted giving alms, as a result of that deed his mind didn’t tend to enjoy nice food, clothes, vehicles, or the five refined kinds of sensual stimulation. And because that financier murdered his brother’s only child for the sake of his fortune, as a result of that deed he burned in hell for many years, for many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of years. And as a residual result of that same deed, he is childless for the seventh time, his fortune ending up in the royal treasury. Now the old merit of that financier has been used up, and he hasn’t accumulated new merit. Today, great king, that financier burns in the Great Hell of Screams.” </p>

<p id="sn3.18:1.1">At Sāvatthī. </p>
<p id="sn3.18:1.2">Seated to one side, King Pasenadi said to the Buddha, “Just now, sir, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind. ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha. But it’s for someone with good friends, companions, and associates, not for someone with bad friends, companions, and associates.’” </p>
<p id="sn3.18:2.1">“That’s so true, great king! That’s so true!” said the Buddha. And he repeated the king’s statement, adding: </p>
<p id="sn3.18:3.1">“Great king, this one time I was staying in the land of the Sakyans where they have a town named Townsville. Then the mendicant Ānanda came to me, bowed, sat down to one side, and said: ‘Sir, good friends, companions, and associates are half the spiritual life.’ </p>
<p id="sn3.18:4.1">When he had spoken, I said to him: ‘Not so, Ānanda! Not so, Ānanda! Good friends, companions, and associates are the whole of the spiritual life. A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path. </p>
<p id="sn3.18:5.1">And how does a mendicant with good friends develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path? It’s when a mendicant develops right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. That’s how a mendicant with good friends develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path. And here’s another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life. </p>
<p id="sn3.18:6.1">For, by relying on me as a good friend, sentient beings who are liable to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are freed from all these things. This is another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life.’ </p>
<p id="sn3.18:7.1">So, great king, you should train like this: ‘I will have good friends, companions, and associates.’ That’s how you should train. </p>
<p id="sn3.18:8.1">When you have good friends, companions, and associates, you should live supported by one thing: diligence in skillful qualities. </p>
<p id="sn3.18:9.1">When you’re diligent, supported by diligence, your ladies of the harem, aristocrat vassals, troops, and people of town and country will think: ‘The king lives diligently, supported by diligence. We’d better live diligently, supported by diligence!’ </p>
<p id="sn3.18:13.1">When you’re diligent, supported by diligence, then not only you yourself, but your ladies of the harem, and your treasury and storehouses will be guarded and protected.” </p>
<p id="sn3.18:13.3">That is what the Buddha said. … </p>

<p id="sn3.8:1.1">At Sāvatthī. </p>
<p id="sn3.8:1.2">Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala was upstairs in the royal longhouse together with Queen Mallikā. </p>
<p id="sn3.8:1.3">Then the king said to the queen, “Mallikā, is there anyone more dear to you than yourself?” </p>
<p id="sn3.8:1.5">“No, great king, there isn’t. But is there anyone more dear to you than yourself?” </p>
<p id="sn3.8:1.7">“For me also, Mallikā, there’s no-one.” </p>
<p id="sn3.8:2.1">Then King Pasenadi of Kosala came downstairs from the stilt longhouse, went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. </p>
<p id="sn3.8:3.1">Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha recited this verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn3.8:4.1">“Having explored every quarter with the mind, <br/>one finds no-one dearer than oneself. <br/>Likewise for others, each holds themselves dear; <br/>so one who loves themselves would harm no other.” </p>

But they tell deliberate lies for the sake of sensual pleasures. Then it occurred to me: ‘Enough with passing judgment today. Now my dear son will be known by the judgments he makes.’” </p>

There are many more who, when they obtain luxury possessions, do get indulgent and negligent, giving in to greed for sensual pleasures, and doing the wrong thing by others.’” </p>

<p id="sn3.1:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>
<p id="sn3.1:1.3">Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, “Does Master Gotama claim to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening?” </p>
<p id="sn3.1:1.6">“If anyone should rightly be said to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening, it’s me. For, great king, I have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening.” </p>
<p id="sn3.1:2.1">“Well, there are those ascetics and brahmins who lead an order and a community, and teach a community. They’re well-known and famous religious founders, deemed holy by many people. That is, Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, Pakudha Kaccāyana, and Ajita of the hair blanket. I also asked them whether they claimed to have awakened to the supreme perfect awakening, but they made no such claim. So why do you, given that you’re so young in age and newly gone forth?” </p>
<p id="sn3.1:3.1">“Great king, these four things should not be looked down upon or disparaged because they are young. What four? An aristocrat, a serpent, a fire, and a mendicant. These four things should not be looked down upon or disparaged because they are young.” </p>
<p id="sn3.1:4.1">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn3.1:5.1">“A man should not despise <br/>an aristocrat of impeccable lineage, <br/>high-born and famous, <br/>just because they’re young. </p>
<p id="sn3.1:6.1">For it’s possible that that lord of men, <br/>as aristocrat, will gain the throne. <br/>And in his anger he’ll execute a royal punishment, <br/>and have you violently beaten. <br/>Hence you should avoid him <br/>for the sake of your own life. </p>
<p id="sn3.1:7.1">Whether in village or wilderness, <br/>wherever a serpent is seen, <br/>a man should not look down on it <br/>or despise it for its youth. </p>
<p id="sn3.1:8.1">With its rainbow of colors, <br/>the serpent of fiery breath glides along. <br/>It lashes out and bites the fool, <br/>both men and women alike. <br/>Hence you should avoid it <br/>for the sake of your own life. </p>
<p id="sn3.1:9.1">A fire devours a huge amount, <br/>a conflagration with a blackened trail. <br/>A man should not look down on it <br/>just because it’s young. </p>
<p id="sn3.1:10.1">For once it gets fuel <br/>it’ll become a huge conflagration. <br/>It’ll lash out and burn the fool, <br/>both men and women alike. <br/>Hence you should avoid it <br/>for the sake of your own life. </p>
<p id="sn3.1:11.1">When a forest is burned by fire, <br/>a conflagration with a blackened trail, <br/>the shoots will spring up there again, <br/>with the passing of the days and nights. </p>
<p id="sn3.1:12.1">But if a mendicant endowed with ethics <br/>burns you with their power, <br/>you’ll have no sons or cattle, <br/>nor will your heirs find wealth. <br/>Childless and heirless you become, <br/>like a palm-tree stump. </p>
<p id="sn3.1:13.1">That’s why an astute person, <br/>seeing what’s good for themselves, <br/>would always treat these properly: <br/>a snake, a conflagration, <br/>a famous aristocrat, <br/>and a mendicant endowed with ethics.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="sn3.1:14.1">When this was said, King Pasenadi of Kosala said to the Buddha, “Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<p id="sn2.30:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. </p>
<p id="sn2.30:1.3">Then, late at night, several glorious gods lit up the entire Bamboo Grove. They were Asama, Sahalī, Niṅka, Ākoṭaka, Vetambarī, and Māṇavagāmiya, and all of them were disciples of various monastics of other religions. They went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. </p>
<p id="sn2.30:1.4">Standing to one side, the god Asama recited this verse about Pūraṇa Kassapa in the Buddha’s presence: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn2.30:2.1">“In injuring and killing here, <br/>in beating and extortion, <br/>Kassapa saw no evil, <br/>nor any merit for oneself. <br/>What he taught should truly be trusted, <br/>he’s worthy of esteem as Teacher.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="sn2.30:3.1">Then the god Sahalī recited this verse about Makkhali Gosala in the Buddha’s presence: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn2.30:4.1">“Through mortification in disgust of sin <j>he became well restrained. </j><br/>He gave up arguing with people. <br/>Refraining from false speech, he spoke the truth. <br/>Surely such a man does no wrong!” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="sn2.30:5.1">Then the god Niṅka recited this verse about the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan in the Buddha’s presence: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="sn2.30:6.1">“Disgusted at sin, an alert mendicant, <br/>well restrained in the four controls; <br/>explaining what is seen and heard: <br/>surely he can be no sinner!” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="sn2.30:7.1">Then the god Ākoṭaka recited this verse about various sectarian teachers in the Buddha’s presence: </p>

<p id="sn2.29:2.1">“Sir, who on earth would not like Venerable Sāriputta unless they’re a fool, a hater, delusional, or mentally deranged? Venerable Sāriputta is astute, he has great wisdom, widespread wisdom, laughing wisdom, swift wisdom, sharp wisdom, and penetrating wisdom. He has few wishes, he’s content, secluded, aloof, and energetic. He gives advice and accepts advice; he accuses and criticizes wickedness.

<p id="sn1.11:2.1">“Once upon a time, mendicants, a certain deity of the company of the Thirty-Three was amusing themselves in the Garden of Delight, escorted by a band of nymphs, and supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation.

<h2>The Translator</h2>
<p><span property="dc:creator">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> was born as Anthony Aidan Best on <span class="dc:date">4/11/1966</span> in Perth, Western Australia. He grew up in the pleasant suburbs of Mt Lawley and Attadale alongside his sister Nicola, who was the good child. His mother, Margaret Lorraine Huntsman née Pinder, said “he’ll either be a priest or a poet”, while his father, Anthony Thomas Best, advised him to “never do anything for money”. He attended Aquinas College, a Catholic school, where he decided to become an atheist. At the University of WA he studied philosophy, aiming to learn what he wanted to do with his life. Finding that what he wanted to do was play guitar, he dropped out. His main band was named Martha’s Vineyard, which achieved modest success in the indie circuit. </p>
<p>A seemingly random encounter with a roadside joey took him to Thailand, where he entered his first meditation retreat at Wat Ram Poeng, Chieng Mai in 1992. Feeling the call to the Buddha’s path, he took full ordination in Wat Pa Nanachat in 1994, where his teachers were Ajahn Pasanno and Ajahn Jayasaro. In 1997 he returned to Perth to study with Ajahn Brahm at Bodhinyana Monastery. </p>
<p>He spent several years practicing in seclusion in Malaysia and Thailand before establishing Santi Forest Monastery in Bundanoon, NSW, in 2003. There he was instrumental in supporting the establishment of the Theravada bhikkhuni order in Australia and advocating for women’s rights. He continues to teach in Australia and globally, with a special concern for the moral implications of climate change and other forms of environmental destruction. He has published a series of books of original and groundbreaking research on early Buddhism. </p>
<p>In 2005 he founded SuttaCentral together with Rod Bucknell and John Kelly. In 2015, seeing the need for a complete, accurate, plain English translation of the Pali texts, he undertook the task, spending nearly three years in isolation on the isle of Qi Mei off the coast of the nation of Taiwan. He completed the four main Nikāyas in 2018, and the early books of the Khuddaka Nikāya were complete by 2021. All this work is dedicated to the public domain and is entirely free of copyright encumbrance. </p>
<p>In 2019 he returned to Sydney where he established Lokanta Vihara (The Monastery at the End of the World). </p>
<h2>Creation Process</h2>
<p>Primary source was the digital Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali Tipiṭaka. Translated from the Pali, with reference to several English translations, especially those of Bhikkhu Bodhi.</p>
<h2>The Translation</h2>
<p>This translation was part of a project to translate the four Pali Nikāyas with the following aims: plain, approachable English; consistent terminology; accurate rendition of the Pali; free of copyright. It was made during 2016–2018 while Bhikkhu Sujato was staying in Qimei, Taiwan.</p>
<h2>About SuttaCentral</h2>
<p>SuttaCentral publishes early Buddhist texts. Since 2005 we have provided root texts in Pali, Chinese, Sanskrit, Tibetan, and other languages, parallels between these texts, and translations in many modern languages. Building on the work of generations of scholars, we offer our contribution freely.</p>
<p>SuttaCentral is driven by volunteer contributions, and in addition we employ professional developers. We offer a sponsorship program for high quality translations from the original languages. Financial support for SuttaCentral is handled by the SuttaCentral Development Trust, a charitable trust registered in Australia.</p>
<h2>About Bilara</h2>
<p>“Bilara” means “cat” in Pali, and it is the name of our Computer Assisted Translation (CAT) software. Bilara is a web app that enables translators to translate early Buddhist texts into their own language. These translations are published on SuttaCentral with the root text and translation side by side.</p>
<h2>About SuttaCentral Editions</h2>
<p>The SuttaCentral Editions project makes high quality books from selected Bilara translations. These are published in formats including HTML, EPUB, PDF, and print.</p>
