\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at \textsanskrit{Bhesakaḷā}’s Wood. 

Then\marginnote{1.3} the householder Nakula’s father went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha: 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.1} I’m an old man, elderly and senior. I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life. My body is ailing and I’m constantly unwell. I hardly ever get to see the esteemed mendicants. May the Buddha please advise me and instruct me. It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.” 

“That’s\marginnote{3.1} so true, householder! That’s so true, householder! For this body is ailing, trapped in its shell. If anyone dragging around this body claimed to be healthy even for a minute, what is that but foolishness? 

So\marginnote{3.4} you should train like this: ‘Though my body is ailing, my mind will be healthy.’ That’s how you should train.” 

And\marginnote{4.1} then the householder Nakula’s father approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went up to Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, bowed, and sat down to one side. \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} said to him: 

“Householder,\marginnote{4.2} your faculties are so very clear, and your complexion is pure and bright. Did you get to hear a Dhamma talk in the Buddha’s presence today?” 

“What\marginnote{5.1} else, sir, could it possibly be?\footnote{This idiom is unusual, if not unique, and a translation should try to convery something of the dramatic quality of it. The force of it seems to be, “What else could possibly have had this effect on me?”, which is not well captured by BB’s “Why not”, and better by Thanissaro’s “How could it be otherwise”. } Just now the Buddha anointed me with the deathless ambrosia of a Dhamma talk.”\footnote{Reinforcing the unique and dramatic quality of the previous line, amatena abhisitto is another unique usage. It is one of the few, if not only, places in the EBTs where the Rg Vedic sense of “ambrosia” for amata is prominent. } 

“But\marginnote{5.3} what kind of ambrosial Dhamma talk has the Buddha anointed you with?” 

So\marginnote{5.4} Nakula’s father told \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} all that had happened, and said, “That’s the ambrosial Dhamma talk that the Buddha anointed me with.” 

“But\marginnote{7.1} didn’t you feel the need to ask the Buddha the further question: ‘Sir, how do you define someone ailing in body and ailing in mind, and someone ailing in body and healthy in mind’?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{7.3} we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}. May Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} himself please clarify the meaning of this.” 

“Well\marginnote{8.1} then, householder, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{8.2} sir,” replied Nakula’s father. \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} said this: 

“And\marginnote{9.1} how is a person ailing in body and ailing in mind? It’s when an unlearned ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the qualities of a noble one. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the qualities of a good person. They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They’re obsessed with the thought: ‘I am form, form is mine!’ But that form of theirs decays and perishes, which gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 

They\marginnote{10.1} regard feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in self, or self in feeling. They’re obsessed with the thought: ‘I am feeling, feeling is mine!’ But that feeling of theirs decays and perishes, which gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 

They\marginnote{11.1} regard perception as self, self as having perception, perception in self, or self in perception. They’re obsessed with the thought: ‘I am perception, perception is mine!’ But that perception of theirs decays and perishes, which gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 

They\marginnote{12.1} regard choices as self, self as having choices, choices in self, or self in choices. They’re obsessed with the thought: ‘I am choices, choices are mine!’ But those choices of theirs decay and perish, which gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 

They\marginnote{13.1} regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. They’re obsessed with the thought: ‘I am consciousness, consciousness is mine!’ But that consciousness of theirs decays and perishes, which gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 

That’s\marginnote{13.5} how a person is ailing in body and ailing in mind. 

And\marginnote{14.1} how is a person ailing in body and healthy in mind? It’s when a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons. They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They’re not obsessed with the thought: ‘I am form, form is mine!’ So when that form of theirs decays and perishes, it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 

They\marginnote{15.1} don’t regard feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in self, or self in feeling. They’re not obsessed with the thought: ‘I am feeling, feeling is mine!’ So when that feeling of theirs decays and perishes, it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 

They\marginnote{16.1} don’t regard perception as self, self as having perception, perception in self, or self in perception. They’re not obsessed with the thought: ‘I am perception, perception is mine!’ So when that perception of theirs decays and perishes, it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 

They\marginnote{17.1} don’t regard choices as self, self as having choices, choices in self, or self in choices. They’re not obsessed with the thought: ‘I am choices, choices are mine!’ So when those choices of theirs decay and perish, it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 

They\marginnote{18.1} don’t regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. They’re not obsessed with the thought: ‘I am consciousness, consciousness is mine!’ So when that consciousness of theirs decays and perishes, it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 

That’s\marginnote{18.5} how a person is ailing in body and healthy in mind.” 

That’s\marginnote{19.1} what Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} said. Satisfied, Nakula’s father was happy with what \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} said.

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, where they have a town named Devadaha. 

Then\marginnote{1.3} several mendicants who were heading for the west went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, we wish to go to a western land to take up residence there.” 

“But\marginnote{2.1} mendicants, have you consulted with \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}?” 

“No,\marginnote{2.2} sir, we haven’t.” 

“You\marginnote{2.3} should consult with \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}. He’s astute, and supports his spiritual companions, the mendicants.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{2.5} sir,” they replied. 

Now\marginnote{3.1} at that time Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} was meditating not far from the Buddha in a clump of golden shower trees.\footnote{The identification of elagala with cassia tora, found in BB, PTS dict, and ultimately probably derived from MW, is unsatisfactory. It is a weed, growing 50cm or so high, hardly a fitting place for meditation, and completely contradicting the commentary. The alternative, Cassia alata or Senna alata is better, since it grows 3-4 M tall, with a glorious golden flower. However it’s native to Mexico. The Chinese parallels don’t seem to offer any assistance. SA 108 has 坐一堅固樹下, where 堅固 might stand for \textsanskrit{gāḍha}, and thus the compound \textsanskrit{ekagāḍha}. But this gets us no further in understanding the sanskrit. Moreoever 堅固 may also stand for \textsanskrit{sāla} or \textsanskrit{sāla}-\textsanskrit{vṛkṣa}, so it could just mean standing under “a” sal tree, where 一 stands for annatara. Sticking with the Cassia family, I’ve gone with cassia fistula, which would at lest be a nice place to meditate! } And then those mendicants approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went up to Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, and exchanged greetings with him. 

When\marginnote{3.3} the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him, “Reverend \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, we wish to go to a western land to take up residence there. We have consulted with the Teacher.” 

“Reverends,\marginnote{4.1} there are those who question a mendicant who has gone abroad—astute aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics—for astute people are inquisitive: ‘But what does the venerables’ Teacher teach? What does he explain?’ I trust the venerables have properly heard, learned, attended, and remembered the teachings, and penetrated them with wisdom. That way, when answering you will repeat what the Buddha has said and not misrepresent him with an untruth. You will explain in line with the teaching, with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism.” 

“Reverend,\marginnote{5.1} we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}. May Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} himself please clarify the meaning of this.” 

“Well\marginnote{5.3} then, reverends, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{5.4} reverend,” they replied. \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} said this: 

“Reverends,\marginnote{6.1} there are those who question a mendicant who has gone abroad—astute aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics—for astute people are inquisitive: ‘But what does the venerables’ Teacher teach? What does he explain?’ When questioned like this, reverends, you should answer: ‘Reverend, our Teacher explained the removal of desire and lust.’ 

When\marginnote{7.1} you answer like this, such astute people may inquire further: ‘But regarding what does the venerables’ teacher explain the removal of desire and lust?’ When questioned like this, reverends, you should answer: ‘Our teacher explains the removal of desire and lust for form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.’ 

When\marginnote{8.1} you answer like this, such astute people may inquire further: ‘But what drawback has he seen that he teaches the removal of desire and lust for form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?’ When questioned like this, reverends, you should answer: ‘If you’re not free of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for form, when that form decays and perishes it gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. If you’re not free of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, when that consciousness decays and perishes it gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. This is the drawback our Teacher has seen that he teaches the removal of desire and lust for form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.’ 

When\marginnote{9.1} you answer like this, such astute people may inquire further: ‘But what benefit has he seen that he teaches the removal of desire and lust for form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?’ When questioned like this, reverends, you should answer: ‘If you are rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for form, when that form decays and perishes it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. If you are rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, when that consciousness decays and perishes it doesn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. This is the benefit our Teacher has seen that he teaches the removal of desire and lust for form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness.’ 

If\marginnote{10.1} those who acquired and kept unskillful qualities were to live happily in the present life, free of anguish, distress, and fever; and if, when their body breaks up, after death, they could expect to go to a good place, the Buddha would not praise giving up unskillful qualities. But since those who acquire and keep unskillful qualities live unhappily in the present life, full of anguish, distress, and fever; and since, when their body breaks up, after death, they can expect to go to a bad place, the Buddha praises giving up unskillful qualities. 

If\marginnote{11.1} those who embraced and kept skillful qualities were to live unhappily in the present life, full of anguish, distress, and fever; and if, when their body breaks up, after death, they could expect to go to a bad place, the Buddha would not praise embracing skillful qualities. But since those who embrace and keep skillful qualities live happily in the present life, free of anguish, distress, and fever; and since, when their body breaks up, after death, they can expect to go to a good place, the Buddha praises embracing skillful qualities.” 

This\marginnote{12.1} is what Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} said.

Then\marginnote{1.3} the householder \textsanskrit{Hāliddikāni} went up to Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahākaccāna}, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, this was said by the Buddha in the Chapter of the Eights, in ‘The Questions of \textsanskrit{Māgandiya}’: 

\begin{verse}%
‘After\marginnote{2.1} leaving shelter to migrate unsettled,\footnote{The line and it’s metaphorical interpretation work on two levels. The oka and niketa are the same basic meaning, but I have translated in line with the underlying etymology: oka from “place of comfort, shelter”, niketa as “heaping, settlement”. Sari means “wander, roam, drift”. Here it has a literal meaning, a homeless wanderer. But later one is said to be a “okasari” “house-wanderer”. How does this make sense? The root -sari is the same as the root for samsara, and so an okasari is one who wanders in samsara. Compare the standard simile for the dibbacakkhu, where a person walks out of one home down the street, and into another. Cf the modern idiom “couch-surfer”. I use the same term as i use for samsara to bring out this connection. } \\
a sage doesn’t get close to anyone in town. \\
Rid of sensual pleasures, expecting nothing, \\
they wouldn’t get in arguments with people.’ 

%
\end{verse}

How\marginnote{3.1} should we see the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement?” 

“Householder,\marginnote{4.1} the form element is a shelter for consciousness. One whose consciousness is shackled to greed for the form element is called a migrant going from shelter to shelter. The feeling element is a shelter for consciousness. One whose consciousness is attached to greed for the feeling element is called a migrant going from shelter to shelter. The perception element is a shelter for consciousness. One whose consciousness is attached to greed for the perception element is called a migrant going from shelter to shelter. The choices element is a shelter for consciousness. One whose consciousness is attached to greed for the choices element is called a migrant going from shelter to shelter. That’s how one is a migrant going from shelter to shelter. 

And\marginnote{5.1} how is one a migrant with no shelter? The Realized One has given up any desire, greed, relishing, and craving for the form element; any attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendencies. He has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future. That’s why the Realized One is called a migrant with no shelter. The Realized One has given up any desire, greed, relishing, and craving for the feeling element … the perception element … the choices element … the consciousness element; any attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendencies. He has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future. That’s why the Realized One is called a migrant with no shelter. That’s how one is a migrant with no shelter. 

And\marginnote{6.1} how is one a migrant going from settlement to settlement? Being attached to migrating from settlement to settlement in pursuit of sights, one is called a migrant going from settlement to settlement. Being attached to migrating from settlement to settlement in pursuit of sounds … smells … tastes … touches … thoughts, one is called a migrant going from settlement to settlement. That’s how one is a migrant going from settlement to settlement. 

And\marginnote{7.1} how is one an unsettled migrant? The Realized One has given up attachment to migrating from settlement to settlement in pursuit of sights. He has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future. That’s why the Realized One is called an unsettled migrant. The Realized One has given up attachment to migrating from settlement to settlement in pursuit of sounds … smells … tastes … touches … thoughts. He has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future. That’s why the Realized One is called an unsettled migrant. That’s how one is an unsettled migrant. 

And\marginnote{8.1} how does one get close to people in town? It’s when someone mixes closely with laypeople, sharing their joys and sorrows—happy when they’re happy and sad when they’re sad—and getting involved in their business. That’s how one gets close to people in town. 

And\marginnote{9.1} how does one not get close to people in town? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t mix closely with laypeople, not sharing their joys and sorrows—not happy when they’re happy or sad when they’re sad—and not getting involved in their business. That’s how one doesn’t get close to people in town. 

And\marginnote{10.1} how is one not rid of sensual pleasures? It’s when someone isn’t rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for sensual pleasures. That’s how one is not rid of sensual pleasures. 

And\marginnote{11.1} how is one rid of sensual pleasures? It’s when someone is rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for sensual pleasures. That’s how one is rid of sensual pleasures. 

And\marginnote{12.1} how does one have expectations? It’s when someone thinks: ‘In the future, may I be of such form, such feeling, such perception, such choices, and such consciousness!’ That’s how one has expectations. 

And\marginnote{13.1} how does one expect nothing? It’s when someone doesn’t think: ‘In the future, may I be of such form, such feeling, such perception, such choices, and such consciousness!’ That’s how one expects nothing. 

And\marginnote{14.1} how does one argue with people? It’s when someone takes part in this sort of discussion: ‘You don’t understand this teaching and training. I understand this teaching and training. What, you understand this teaching and training? You’re practicing wrong. I’m practicing right. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. I stay on topic, you don’t. What you’ve thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You’re trapped; get yourself out of this—if you can!’\footnote{Sahita as a quality of dhamma talks is found at AN 4.139 and AN 8.16. The basic meaning is “unified, together”. It is the same as the Vedic “samhita”. To me, “consistent” is more of a logical property, whereas what I think this means is “to the point, on topic.” Also note that PTS dict for this says reading avicinna is to be preferred. Under vicinna it says adhicinna is preferred. Handy. } That’s how one argues with people. 

And\marginnote{15.1} how does one not argue with people? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t take part in this sort of discussion: ‘You don’t understand this teaching and training … get yourself out of this—if you can!’ That’s how one doesn’t argue with people. 

So,\marginnote{16.1} householder, that’s how to understand the detailed meaning of what the Buddha said in brief in the Chapter of the Eights, in ‘The Questions of \textsanskrit{Māgandiya}’: 

\begin{verse}%
‘After\marginnote{17.1} leaving shelter to migrate unsettled, \\
a sage doesn’t get close to anyone in town. \\
Rid of sensual pleasures, expecting nothing, \\
they wouldn’t get in arguments with people.’”

“Yes,\marginnote{1.4} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“And\marginnote{2.1} how does grasping lead to anxiety? It’s when an unlearned ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons. They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. But that form of theirs decays and perishes, and consciousness latches on to the perishing of form. Anxieties occupy their mind, born of latching on to the perishing of form, and originating in accordance with natural principles.\footnote{See https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/parallels-and-translation-of-sn-22-7-help/2926 } So they become frightened, worried, concerned, and anxious because of grasping. 

They\marginnote{3.1} regard feeling as self … 

They\marginnote{4.1} regard perception as self … 

They\marginnote{4.2} regard choices as self … 

They\marginnote{5.1} regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness.

Anxieties occupy their mind, born of latching on to the perishing of consciousness, and originating in accordance with natural principles. So they become frightened, worried, concerned, and anxious because of grasping. That’s how grasping leads to anxiety. 

And\marginnote{6.1} how does not grasping lead to freedom from anxiety? It’s when a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons. They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. When that form of theirs decays and perishes, consciousness doesn’t latch on to the perishing of form. Anxieties—born of latching on to the perishing of form and originating in accordance with natural principles—don’t occupy their mind.

And\marginnote{3.1} what is the picking up of the burden? It’s the craving that leads to future lives, mixed up with relishing and greed, chasing pleasure in various realms.

If\marginnote{2.7} you have no underlying tendency for form, you’re not defined by that. If you have no underlying tendency for feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, you’re not defined by that. 

That’s\marginnote{2.12} how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement.” 

“Good,\marginnote{3.1} good, mendicant! It’s good that you understand the detailed meaning of what I’ve said in brief like this. 

If\marginnote{3.3} you have an underlying tendency for form, you’re defined by that. If you have an underlying tendency for feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, you’re defined by that. 

If\marginnote{3.8} you have no underlying tendency for form, you’re not defined by that. If you have no underlying tendency for feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, you’re not defined by that. 

This\marginnote{3.13} is how to understand the detailed meaning of what I said in brief.” 

And\marginnote{4.1} then that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 

Then\marginnote{5.1} that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 

He\marginnote{5.2} understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And that mendicant became one of the perfected.

Then\marginnote{1.2} a mendicant went up to the Buddha … and asked him, “Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.” 

“Mendicant,\marginnote{1.4} you’re measured against what you have an underlying tendency for, and you’re defined by what you’re measured against. You’re not measured against what you have no underlying tendency for, and you’re not defined by what you’re not measured against.”

When\marginnote{1.3} you live like this, you should examine the cause: ‘From what are sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress born and produced?’ 

And,\marginnote{2.1} mendicants, from what are sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress born and produced? It’s when an unlearned ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons. They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. But that form of theirs decays and perishes, which gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 

They\marginnote{2.6} regard feeling as self … 

They\marginnote{2.9} regard perception as self … 

They\marginnote{2.10} regard choices as self … 

They\marginnote{2.11} regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. But that consciousness of theirs decays and perishes, which gives rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. 

Sorrow,\marginnote{3.1} lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are given up when you understand the impermanence of form—its perishing, fading away, and cessation—and you truly see with right understanding that all form, whether past or present, is impermanent, suffering, and perishable. When these things are given up there’s no anxiety. Without anxiety you live happily. A mendicant who lives happily is said to be extinguished in that respect.

The\marginnote{3.1} five faculties stay right where they are. But a learned noble disciple gives up ignorance about them and gives rise to knowledge.

“But\marginnote{4.17} if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” 

“No,\marginnote{4.19} sir.” 

“So,\marginnote{5.1} \textsanskrit{Soṇa}, you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: \emph{all} form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ 

You\marginnote{6.1} should truly see any kind of feeling … perception … choices … consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: \emph{all} consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ 

Seeing\marginnote{7.1} this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. 

They\marginnote{7.3} understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”

They don’t understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation. I don’t regard them as true ascetics and brahmins.

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

There\marginnote{1.2} the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: “‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine.’\footnote{See BB’s note. } A mendicant who makes such a resolution can cut off the five lower fetters.” 

When\marginnote{1.5} he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha, “But sir, how can a mendicant who makes such a resolution cut off the five lower fetters?” 

“Mendicant,\marginnote{2.1} take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in their teaching. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in their teaching. 

They\marginnote{2.2} regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They regard feeling … perception … choices … consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. 

They\marginnote{3.1} don’t truly understand form—which is impermanent—as impermanent. They don’t truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is impermanent—as impermanent. 

They\marginnote{4.1} don’t truly understand form—which is suffering—as suffering. They don’t truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is suffering—as suffering. 

They\marginnote{5.1} don’t truly understand form—which is not-self—as not-self. They don’t truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is not-self—as not-self. 

They\marginnote{6.1} don’t truly understand form—which is conditioned—as conditioned. They don’t truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is conditioned—as conditioned. 

They\marginnote{6.6} don’t truly understand that form will disappear. They don’t truly understand that feeling … perception … choices … consciousness will disappear. 

But\marginnote{7.1} a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons. They don’t regard form as self … They don’t regard feeling … perception … choices … consciousness as self. 

They\marginnote{8.1} truly understand form—which is impermanent—as impermanent. They truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is impermanent—as impermanent. 

They\marginnote{8.6} truly understand form … feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is suffering—as suffering. 

They\marginnote{8.7} truly understand form … feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is not-self—as not-self. 

They\marginnote{8.8} truly understand form … feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is conditioned—as conditioned. 

They\marginnote{8.9} truly understand that form will disappear. They truly understand that feeling … perception … choices … consciousness will disappear. 

It’s\marginnote{9.1} because of the disappearance of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness that a mendicant who makes such a resolution—‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine’—can cut off the five lower fetters.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{9.4} a mendicant who makes such a resolution can cut off the five lower fetters.\footnote{Note that both punctuation and text incorrectly end the direct speech here. } 

But\marginnote{10.1} how are they to know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life?” 

“Mendicant,\marginnote{10.2} an unlearned ordinary person worries about things that aren’t a worry. For an unlearned ordinary person worries: ‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine.’ 

A\marginnote{11.1} learned noble disciple doesn’t worry about things that aren’t a worry. For a learned noble disciple doesn’t worry: ‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be, and it will not be mine.’ 

As\marginnote{11.4} long as consciousness remains, it would remain involved with form, supported by form, founded on form. And with a sprinkle of relishing, it would grow, increase, and mature. 

Or\marginnote{11.5} consciousness would remain involved with feeling … 

Or\marginnote{11.6} consciousness would remain involved with perception … 

Or\marginnote{11.7} consciousness would remain involved with choices, supported by choices, grounded on choices. And with a sprinkle of relishing, it would grow, increase, and mature. 

Suppose,\marginnote{12.1} mendicant, you were to say: ‘Apart from form, feeling, perception, and choices, I will describe the coming and going of consciousness, its passing away and reappearing, its growth, increase, and maturity.’ That is not possible. 

If\marginnote{13.1} a mendicant has given up greed for the form element, the support is cut off, and there is no foundation for consciousness. 

If\marginnote{13.2} a mendicant has given up greed for the feeling element …

consciousness\marginnote{13.5} element, the support is cut off, and there is no foundation for consciousness. Since that consciousness does not become established and does not grow, with no power to regenerate, it is freed. 

Being\marginnote{13.7} free, it’s stable. Being stable, it’s content. Being content, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished. 

They\marginnote{13.8} understand: ‘Rebirth is ended … there is no return to any state of existence.’ 

The\marginnote{13.9} ending of the defilements is for one who knows and sees this.”

And\marginnote{2.1} how are there four perspectives? I directly knew form, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation. I directly knew feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation. 

And\marginnote{3.1} what is form? The four primary elements, and form derived from the four primary elements. This is called form. Form originates from food. When food ceases, form ceases. The practice that leads to the cessation of form is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 

Whatever\marginnote{4.1} ascetics and brahmins have directly known form in this way—and its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation—and are practicing for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding form: they are practicing well. Those who practice well have a firm footing in this teaching and training. 

Those\marginnote{5.1} ascetics and brahmins who have directly known form in this way—and its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation—and due to disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding form, are freed by not grasping: they are well freed. Those who are well freed are consummate ones. For consummate ones, there is no cycle of rebirths to be found. 

And\marginnote{6.1} what is feeling? There are these six classes of feeling: feeling born of contact through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. This is called feeling. Feeling originates from contact. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. The practice that leads to the cessation of feelings is simply this noble eightfold path … 

And\marginnote{9.1} what is perception? There are these six classes of perception: perceptions of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts. This is called perception. Perception originates from contact. When contact ceases, perception ceases. The practice that leads to the cessation of perceptions is simply this noble eightfold path … 

And\marginnote{10.1} what are choices? There are these six classes of intention: intention regarding sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts. These are called choices. Choices originate from contact. When contact ceases, choices cease. The practice that leads to the cessation of choices is simply this noble eightfold path … 

And\marginnote{13.1} what is consciousness? There are these six classes of consciousness: eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind consciousness. This is called consciousness. Consciousness originates from name and form. When name and form cease, consciousness ceases. The practice that leads to the cessation of consciousness is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.

“Yes,\marginnote{4.4} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“The\marginnote{5.1} Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha gave rise to the unarisen path, gave birth to the unborn path, and explained the unexplained path. He is the knower of the path, the discoverer of the path, the expert on the path. And now the disciples live following the path; they acquire it later. 

This\marginnote{5.3} is the difference between a Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, and a mendicant freed by wisdom.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana. There the Buddha addressed the group of five mendicants: 

“Mendicants!”\marginnote{1.3} 

“Venerable\marginnote{1.4} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.1} form is not-self. For if form were self, it wouldn’t lead to affliction. And you could compel form: ‘May my form be like this! May it not be like that!’ But because form is not-self, it leads to affliction. And you can’t compel form: ‘May my form be like this! May it not be like that!’ 

Feeling\marginnote{3.1} is not-self … 

Perception\marginnote{4.1} is not-self … 

Choices\marginnote{4.2} are not-self … 

Consciousness\marginnote{5.1} is not-self. For if consciousness were self, it wouldn’t lead to affliction. And you could compel consciousness: ‘May my consciousness be like this! May it not be like that!’ But because consciousness is not-self, it leads to affliction. And you can’t compel consciousness: ‘May my consciousness be like this! May it not be like that!’ 

What\marginnote{6.1} do you think, mendicants? Is form permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{6.3} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{6.4} if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” 

“Suffering,\marginnote{6.5} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{6.6} if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” 

“No,\marginnote{6.8} sir.” 

“Is\marginnote{6.9} feeling permanent or impermanent?” … 

“Is\marginnote{6.10} perception permanent or impermanent?” … 

“Are\marginnote{6.11} choices permanent or impermanent?” … 

“Is\marginnote{6.12} consciousness permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{6.13} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{6.14} if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” 

“Suffering,\marginnote{6.15} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{6.16} if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” 

“No,\marginnote{6.18} sir.” 

“So\marginnote{7.1} you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: \emph{all} form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ 

Any\marginnote{8.1} kind of feeling at all … 

Any\marginnote{9.1} kind of perception at all … 

Any\marginnote{9.2} kind of choices at all … 

You\marginnote{10.1} should truly see any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: \emph{all} consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ 

Seeing\marginnote{11.1} this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. 

They\marginnote{11.3} understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’” 

That\marginnote{12.1} is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the group of five mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of the group of five mendicants were freed from defilements by not grasping.

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Vesālī}, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 

Then\marginnote{1.3} \textsanskrit{Mahāli} the Licchavi went up to the Buddha … and said to him: 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.1} \textsanskrit{Pūraṇa} Kassapa says this: ‘There is no cause or reason for the corruption of sentient beings. Sentient beings are corrupted without cause or reason. There’s no cause or reason for the purification of sentient beings. Sentient beings are purified without cause or reason.’ What does the Buddha say about this?” 

“\textsanskrit{Mahāli},\marginnote{3.1} there is a cause and reason for the corruption of sentient beings. Sentient beings are corrupted with cause and reason. There is a cause and reason for the purification of sentient beings. Sentient beings are purified with cause and reason.” 

“But\marginnote{4.1} sir, what is the cause and reason for the corruption of sentient beings? How are sentient beings corrupted with cause and reason?” 

“\textsanskrit{Mahāli},\marginnote{5.1} if form were exclusively painful—soaked and steeped in pain and not steeped in pleasure—sentient beings wouldn’t be aroused by it. But because form is pleasurable—soaked and steeped in pleasure and not steeped in pain—sentient beings do lust after it. Since they lust after it, they’re caught up in it, and so they become corrupted. This is a cause and reason for the corruption of sentient beings. This is how sentient beings are corrupted with cause and reason. 

If\marginnote{6.1} feeling …

consciousness\marginnote{8.1} were exclusively painful—soaked and steeped in pain and not steeped in pleasure—sentient beings wouldn’t be aroused by it.

“But\marginnote{9.1} sir, what is the cause and reason for the purification of sentient beings? How are sentient beings purified with cause and reason?” 

“\textsanskrit{Mahāli},\marginnote{9.3} if form were exclusively pleasurable—soaked and steeped in pleasure and not steeped in pain—sentient beings wouldn’t grow disillusioned with it. But because form is painful—soaked and steeped in pain and not steeped in pleasure—sentient beings do grow disillusioned with it. Being disillusioned, desire fades away.

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} there are these three scopes of language, terminology, and descriptions. They’re uncorrupted, as they have been since the beginning. They’re not being corrupted now, nor will they be. Sensible ascetics and brahmins don’t look down on them.\footnote{Contra BB, the “patha” are not the five aggregates (there’s three of them!) but the three ways of using language, i.e. the three tenses. } What three?

Even\marginnote{13.2} those wanderers of the past, Vassa and \textsanskrit{Bhañña} of \textsanskrit{Ukkalā}, who taught the doctrines of no-cause, inaction, and nihilism, didn’t imagine that these three scopes of language should be criticized or rejected. Why is that? For fear of blame, attack, and condemnation.”

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. 

Then\marginnote{1.3} a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.” 

“When\marginnote{1.5} you grasp, mendicant, you’re bound by \textsanskrit{Māra}. Not grasping, you’re free from the Wicked One.” 

“Understood,\marginnote{1.7} Blessed One! Understood, Holy One!” 

“But\marginnote{2.1} how do you see the detailed meaning of my brief statement?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.2} when you grasp form you’re bound by \textsanskrit{Māra}. Not grasping, you’re free from the Wicked One. When you grasp feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, you’re bound by \textsanskrit{Māra}. Not grasping, you’re free from the Wicked One.

This\marginnote{3.10} is how to understand the detailed meaning of what I said in brief.” 

And\marginnote{4.1} then that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 

Then\marginnote{4.2} that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 

He\marginnote{4.3} understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And that mendicant became one of the perfected.

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} towards evening the lion, king of beasts, emerges from his den, yawns, looks all around the four quarters, and roars his lion’s roar three times. Then he sets out on the hunt. And whatever animals hear the roar of the lion, king of beasts, are typically filled with fear, awe, and terror. They return to their lairs, be they in a hole, the water, or a wood; and the birds take to the air. Even the royal elephants, bound with strong harness in the villages, towns, and capital cities, break apart their bonds, and urinate and defecate in terror as they flee here and there. That’s how powerful is the lion, king of beasts, among animals, how illustrious and mighty. 

In\marginnote{2.1} the same way, when a Realized One arises in the world—perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed—he teaches the Dhamma: ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling … Such is perception … Such are choices … Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ 

Now,\marginnote{2.7} there are gods who are long-lived, beautiful, and very happy, living for ages in their divine palaces. When they hear this teaching by the Realized One, they’re typically filled with fear, awe, and terror. ‘Oh no! It turns out we’re impermanent, though we thought we were permanent! It turns out we don’t last, though we thought we were everlasting! It turns out we’re short-lived, though we thought we were eternal! It turns out that we’re impermanent, not lasting, short-lived, and included within identity.’ That’s how powerful is the Realized One in the world with its gods, how illustrious and mighty.” 

That\marginnote{2.13} is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 

\begin{verse}%
“The\marginnote{3.1} Buddha, the teacher without a peer \\
in all the world with its gods, \\
rolls forth the Wheel of Dhamma \\
from his own insight: 

identity,\marginnote{4.1} its cessation, \\
the origin of identity, \\
and the noble eightfold path \\
that leads to the stilling of suffering. 

And\marginnote{5.1} then the long-lived gods, \\
so beautiful and glorious, \\
are afraid and full of terror, \\
like the other beasts when they hear a lion. 

‘We\marginnote{6.1} haven’t transcended identity! \\
It turns out we’re impermanent!’ \\
So they say when they hear the word \\
of the perfected one, free and poised.”

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} whatever ascetics and brahmins recollect many kinds of past lives, all recollect the five grasping aggregates, or one of them. What five? ‘I had such form in the past.’ Recollecting thus, it’s only form that they recollect. ‘I had such feeling … perception … choices … consciousness in the past.’ Recollecting thus, it’s only consciousness that they recollect. 

And\marginnote{2.1} why do you call it form? It’s deformed; that’s why it’s called ‘form’. Deformed by what? Deformed by cold, heat, hunger, and thirst, and deformed by the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. It’s deformed; that’s why it’s called ‘form’. 

And\marginnote{3.1} why do you call it feeling? It feels; that’s why it’s called ‘feeling’. And what does it feel? It feels pleasure, pain, and neutral. It feels; that’s why it’s called ‘feeling’. 

And\marginnote{4.1} why do you call it perception? It perceives; that’s why it’s called ‘perception’. And what does it perceive? It perceives blue, yellow, red, and white. It perceives; that’s why it’s called ‘perception’. 

And\marginnote{5.1} why do you call them choices? Choices produce conditioned phenomena; that’s why they’re called ‘choices’.\footnote{Good luck translating this. } And what are the conditioned phenomena that they produce? Form is a conditioned phenomenon; choices are what make it into form. Feeling is a conditioned phenomenon; choices are what make it into feeling. Perception is a conditioned phenomenon; choices are what make it into perception. Choices are conditioned phenomena; choices are what make them into choices. Consciousness is a conditioned phenomenon; choices are what make it into consciousness. Choices produce conditioned phenomena; that’s why they’re called ‘choices’. 

And\marginnote{6.1} why do you call it consciousness? It cognizes; that’s why it’s called ‘consciousness’. And what does it cognize? It cognizes sour, bitter, pungent, sweet, hot, mild, salty, and bland.\footnote{kharika is to the root ksayati, to burn, thus = “hot”, not “sharp” (BB) or “alkaline” (Thanissaro) } It cognizes; that’s why it’s called ‘consciousness’. 

A\marginnote{7.1} learned noble disciple reflects on this: ‘Currently I’m itched by form.\footnote{Khajja is from the root to eat. But it also has the idiomatic meaning “to itch” https://suttacentral.net/define/khajjati The English word “itch” is likewise derived from “eat”. In this case, I’m not clear on what it means to say these things “devour” you. The comm explains it as “itch” (see BB’s note) and for once I’m inclined to agree with them. At least it gives a straightforward meaning. It’s parallel with “tormented”. } In the past I was also itched by form just like now. If I were to look forward to enjoying form in the future, I’d be itched by form in the future just as I am today.’ Reflecting like this they don’t worry about past form, they don’t look forward to enjoying future form, and they practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding present form. 

‘Currently\marginnote{8.1} I’m itched by feeling … 

perception\marginnote{9.1} … 

choices\marginnote{9.2} … 

consciousness.\marginnote{10.1} In the past I was also itched by consciousness just like now. If I were to look forward to enjoying consciousness in the future, I’d be itched by consciousness in the future just as I am today.’ Reflecting like this they don’t worry about past consciousness, they don’t look forward to enjoying future consciousness, and they practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding present consciousness. 

What\marginnote{11.1} do you think, mendicants? Is form permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{11.3} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{11.4} if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” 

“Suffering,\marginnote{11.5} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{11.6} if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” 

“No,\marginnote{11.8} sir.” 

“Is\marginnote{11.9} feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{11.13} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{11.14} if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” 

“Suffering,\marginnote{11.15} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{11.16} if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” 

“No,\marginnote{11.18} sir.” 

“So\marginnote{11.19} you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: \emph{all} form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ You should truly see any kind of feeling … perception … choices … consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: \emph{all} consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ 

This\marginnote{12.1} is called a noble disciple who gets rid of things and doesn’t accumulate them; who gives things up and doesn’t grasp at them; who discards things and doesn’t amass them; who dissipates things and doesn’t get clouded by them.\footnote{The idiom is dispersing a cloud or steam or smoke, as opposed to creating a cloud of smoke, etc. } 

And\marginnote{12.5} what things do they get rid of and not accumulate? They get rid of form and don’t accumulate it. They get rid of feeling … perception … choices … consciousness and don’t accumulate it. 

And\marginnote{12.11} what things do they give up and not grasp? They give up form and don’t grasp it. They give up feeling … perception … choices … consciousness and don’t grasp it. 

And\marginnote{12.17} what things do they discard and not amass? They discard form and don’t amass it. They discard feeling … perception … choices … consciousness and don’t amass it. 

And\marginnote{12.23} what things do they dissipate and not get clouded by? They dissipate form and don’t get clouded by it. They dissipate feeling … perception … choices … consciousness and don’t get clouded by it. 

Seeing\marginnote{13.1} this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. 

They\marginnote{13.3} understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ 

This\marginnote{14.1} is called a mendicant who neither gets rid of things nor accumulates them, but remains after getting rid of them. They neither give things up nor grasp them, but remain after giving them up. They neither discard things nor amass them, but remain after discarding them. They neither dissipate things nor get clouded by them, but remain after dissipating them. 

And\marginnote{14.2} what things do they neither get rid of nor accumulate, but remain after getting rid of them?\footnote{MS punctuation in this passage is wrong, and I have corrected it in the Pali. } They neither get rid of nor accumulate form, but remain after getting rid of it. They neither get rid of nor accumulate feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, but remain after getting rid of it. 

And\marginnote{14.8} what things do they neither give up nor grasp, but remain after giving them up? They neither give up nor grasp form, but remain after giving it up. They neither give up nor grasp feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, but remain after giving it up. 

And\marginnote{14.14} what things do they neither discard nor amass, but remain after discarding them? They neither discard nor amass form, but remain after discarding it. They neither discard nor amass feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, but remain after discarding it. 

And\marginnote{14.20} what things do they neither dissipate nor get clouded by, but remain after dissipating them? They neither dissipate nor get clouded by form, but remain after dissipating it.

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. 

Then\marginnote{1.2} the Buddha, having dismissed the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} for some reason, robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kapilavatthu for alms. He wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Great Wood, plunged deep into it, and sat at the root of a young wood apple tree for the day’s meditation. 

Then\marginnote{2.1} as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, “I’ve sent the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} away. But there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. Not seeing me they may change and fall apart. If a young calf doesn’t see its mother it may change and fall apart. … Or if young seedlings don’t get water they may change and fall apart. In the same way, there are mendicants here who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. Not seeing me they may change and fall apart. Why don’t I support the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} now as I did in the past?” 

Then\marginnote{3.1} \textsanskrit{Brahmā} Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the \textsanskrit{Brahmā} realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: “That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! The Buddha has sent the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} away. But there are mendicants who are junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training. … May the Buddha be happy with the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}! May the Buddha welcome the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}! May the Buddha support the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} now as he did in the past!” 

The\marginnote{4.1} Buddha consented in silence. Then \textsanskrit{Brahmā} Sahampati, knowing that the Buddha had consented, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there. 

Then\marginnote{5.1} in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the Banyan Tree Monastery, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then he used his psychic power to will that the mendicants would come to him timidly, alone or in pairs. Those mendicants approached the Buddha timidly, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{6.1} this relying on alms is an extreme lifestyle.\footnote{Not sure about BB’s “lowest” for anta here. } The world curses you: ‘You beggar, walking bowl in hand!’\footnote{I found BB’s note here confusing. For the record, \textsanskrit{kapāla} is not found in the text, but in the commentary. } Yet earnest gentlemen take it up for a good reason.\footnote{The meaning of atthavasika is clarified at https://suttacentral.net/pi/pi-tv-pvr14. A mendicant who is approaching the sangha with some litigation should do so, maong a long list of reasons: atthavasikena \textsanskrit{bhavitabbaṁ} no parisakappikena. To paraphrase, this seems to mean “looking for a genuinely good outcome for all concerned, not trying to get excused by the assembly”. I choose “earnest” as an English term with a similar sense. } Not because they’ve been forced to by kings or bandits, or because they’re in debt or threatened, or to earn a living. But because they’re swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They’re swamped by suffering, mired in suffering. And they think, ‘Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’ 

That’s\marginnote{7.1} how this gentleman has gone forth. Yet they covet sensual pleasures; they’re infatuated, full of ill will and malicious intent. They are unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying mind and undisciplined faculties. Suppose there was a firebrand for lighting a funeral pyre, burning at both ends, and smeared with dung in the middle. It couldn’t be used as timber either in the village or the wilderness. I say that person is just like this. They’ve missed out on the pleasures of the lay life, and haven’t fulfilled the goal of the ascetic life. 

There\marginnote{8.1} are these three unskillful thoughts. Sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts. And where do these three unskillful thoughts cease without anything left over? In those who meditate with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation; or who develop signless immersion. Just this much is quite enough motivation to develop signless immersion. When signless immersion is developed and cultivated it is very fruitful and beneficial. 

There\marginnote{9.1} are these two views. Views favoring continued existence and views favoring ending existence. A learned noble disciple reflects on this: ‘Is there anything in the world that I could grasp without fault?’ They understand: ‘There’s nothing in the world that I could grasp without fault. For in grasping I would grasp only at form, feeling, perception, choices, or consciousness. That grasping of mine would be a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. 

What\marginnote{10.1} do you think, mendicants? Is form permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{10.3} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{10.4} if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” 

“Suffering,\marginnote{10.5} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{10.6} if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” 

“No,\marginnote{10.8} sir.” 

“Is\marginnote{10.9} feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?” … 

“So\marginnote{10.13} you should truly see … 

Seeing\marginnote{10.14} this … They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. 

Then\marginnote{1.2} the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Kosambi for alms. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he set his lodgings in order himself. Taking his bowl and robe, without informing his attendants or taking leave of the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}, he set out to go wandering alone, with no companion. 

Then,\marginnote{2.1} not long after the Buddha had left, one of the mendicants went to Venerable Ānanda and told him what had happened. Ānanda said, “Reverend, when the Buddha leaves like this it means he wants to stay alone. At this time no-one should follow him.” 

Then\marginnote{3.1} the Buddha, traveling stage by stage, arrived at \textsanskrit{Pārileyya}, where he stayed at the root of a sacred sal tree. Then several mendicants went up to Venerable Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him. 

When\marginnote{3.4} the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him, “Reverend, it’s been a long time since we’ve heard a Dhamma talk from the Buddha. We wish to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.” 

Then\marginnote{4.1} Venerable Ānanda together with those mendicants went to \textsanskrit{Pārileyya} to see the Buddha. They bowed and sat down to one side, and the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk. 

Now\marginnote{4.3} at that time one of the monks had the thought, “How do you know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life?” 

Then\marginnote{4.5} the Buddha, knowing what that monk was thinking, addressed the mendicants: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{4.6} I’ve taught the Dhamma analytically. I’ve analytically taught the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path. That’s how I’ve taught the Dhamma analytically. Though I’ve taught the Dhamma analytically, still a certain mendicant present here has this thought:\footnote{Contra BB, I read this as a locative absolute. The context, and the panidhekaccassa, suggest the sense of “though, despite”. It seems a bit harsh, but I guess the Buddha was in a bad mood. Unless we take this sense, the structure of the Buddha’s answer is hard to account for. } ‘How do you know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life?’ 

And\marginnote{5.1} how, mendicants, do you know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life? Take an unlearned ordinary person who has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons. 

They\marginnote{5.3} regard form as self. But that regarding is just a conditioned phenomenon. And what’s the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of that conditioned phenomenon? When an unlearned ordinary person is struck by feelings born of contact with ignorance, craving arises. That conditioned phenomenon is born from that. So that conditioned phenomenon is impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated. And that craving, that feeling, that contact,\footnote{The syntax here suggests that vedana and phassa are to be taken together. But the later passages show that this is just an artifact of abbreviation. } and that ignorance are also impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated. That’s how you should know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life. 

Perhaps\marginnote{6.1} they don’t regard form as self, but they still regard self as possessing form. But that regarding is just a conditioned phenomenon. … 

Perhaps\marginnote{7.1} they don’t regard form as self, or self as possessing form, but they still regard form in self. But that regarding is just a conditioned phenomenon. … 

Perhaps\marginnote{8.1} they don’t regard form as self, or self as possessing form, or form in self, but they still regard self in form. But that regarding is just a conditioned phenomenon. … 

Perhaps\marginnote{9.1} they don’t regard form as self, or self as possessing form, or form in self, or self in form. But they regard feeling as self … perception as self … choices as self … consciousness as self … But that regarding is just a conditioned phenomenon. And what’s the source of that conditioned phenomenon? When an unlearned ordinary person is struck by feelings born of contact with ignorance, craving arises. That conditioned phenomenon is born from that. So that conditioned phenomenon is impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated. And that craving, that feeling, that contact, and that ignorance are also impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated. That’s how you should know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life. 

Perhaps\marginnote{10.1} they don’t regard form or feeling or perception or choices or consciousness as self. Still, they have such a view: ‘The self and the cosmos are one and the same. After passing away I will be permanent, everlasting, eternal, and imperishable.’\footnote{This kind of double demonstrative construction is an emphatic identity. This is in fact the Upanishadic thesis. } But that eternalist view is just a conditioned phenomenon. And what’s the source of that conditioned phenomenon? … That’s how you should know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life. 

Perhaps\marginnote{11.1} they don’t regard form or feeling or perception or choices or consciousness as self. Nor do they have such a view: ‘The self and the cosmos are one and the same. After passing away I will be permanent, everlasting, eternal, and imperishable.’ Still, they have such a view: ‘I might not be, and it might not be mine. I will not be, and it will not be mine.’ But that annihilationist view is just a conditioned phenomenon. And what’s the source of that conditioned phenomenon? … That’s how you should know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life. 

Perhaps\marginnote{12.1} they don’t regard form or feeling or perception or choices or consciousness as self. Nor do they have such a view: ‘The self and the cosmos are one and the same. After passing away I will be permanent, everlasting, eternal, and imperishable.’ Nor do they have such a view: ‘I might not be, and it might not be mine. I will not be, and it will not be mine.’ Still, they have doubts and uncertainties. They’re undecided about the true teaching. That doubt and uncertainty, the indecision about the true teaching, is just a conditioned phenomenon. And what’s the source of that conditioned phenomenon? When an unlearned ordinary person is struck by feelings born of contact with ignorance, craving arises. That conditioned phenomenon is born from that. So that conditioned phenomenon is impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated. And that craving, that feeling, that contact, and that ignorance are also impermanent, conditioned, and dependently originated. That’s how you should know and see in order to end the defilements in the present life.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of \textsanskrit{Migāra}’s mother, together with a large \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of mendicants. Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of monks. 

Then\marginnote{2.1} one of the mendicants got up from their seat, arranged their robe over one shoulder, raised their joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.2} I’d like to ask the Buddha about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.” 

“Well\marginnote{2.3} then, mendicant, take your own seat and ask what you wish.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{2.4} sir,” replied that mendicant. He took his seat and said to the Buddha: 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.5} are these the five grasping aggregates, that is: form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{3.1} they are,” replied the Buddha. 

Saying\marginnote{3.3} “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question: 

“But\marginnote{4.1} sir, what is the root of these five grasping aggregates?” 

“These\marginnote{4.2} five grasping aggregates are rooted in desire.” …\footnote{It looks like a sadhu passage has been elided here. Indeed, in the parallel at MN 109, this sadhu passage is omitted, and so are the ones following, while here, only this one is omitted. } “But sir, is that grasping the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates? Or is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates another?” 

“Neither.\marginnote{4.4} Rather, the desire and greed for them is the grasping there.” 

Saying\marginnote{4.5} “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question: 

“But\marginnote{5.1} sir, can there be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates?” 

“There\marginnote{5.2} can,” said the Buddha. 

“It’s\marginnote{5.3} when someone thinks: ‘In the future, may I be of such form, such feeling, such perception, such choices, or such consciousness!’ That’s how there can be different kinds of desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates.”\footnote{MS question mark here is incorrect. } 

Saying\marginnote{5.6} “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question: 

“Sir,\marginnote{6.1} what is the scope of the term ‘aggregates’ as applied to the aggregates?”\footnote{BB’s “in what way” is not quite right here. kittavata means “to what extent” and is used to define or delineate. The question is whether there’s anything outside the khandhas. } 

“Any\marginnote{6.2} kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: this is called the aggregate of form. Any kind of feeling at all … Any kind of perception at all … Any kind of choices at all … Any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: this is called the aggregate of consciousness. That’s the scope of the term ‘aggregates’ as applied to the aggregates.” 

Saying\marginnote{6.8} “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question: 

“What\marginnote{7.1} is the cause, sir, what is the reason why the aggregate of form is found? What is the cause, what is the reason why the aggregate of feeling … perception … choices … consciousness is found?” 

“The\marginnote{7.6} four primary elements are the reason why the aggregate of form is found. Contact is the reason why the aggregates of feeling, perception, and choices are found. Name and form are the reasons why the aggregate of consciousness is found.” 

Saying\marginnote{7.11} “Good, sir”, that mendicant asked another question: 

“Sir,\marginnote{8.1} how does identity view come about?” 

“It’s\marginnote{8.2} because an unlearned ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons. They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They regard feeling … perception … choices … consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. That’s how identity view comes about.” 

Saying\marginnote{8.9} “Good, sir”, that mendicant … asked another question: 

“But\marginnote{9.1} sir, how does identity view not come about?” 

It’s\marginnote{9.2} because a learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons. They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They don’t regard feeling … perception … choices … consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. That’s how identity view does not come about.” 

Saying\marginnote{9.9} “Good, sir”, that mendicant … asked another question: 

“Sir,\marginnote{10.1} what’s the gratification, the drawback, and the escape when it comes to form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?” 

“The\marginnote{10.6} pleasure and happiness that arise from form: this is its gratification. That form is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback. Removing and giving up desire and greed for form: this is its escape. The pleasure and happiness that arise from feeling … perception … choices … consciousness: this is its gratification. That consciousness is impermanent, suffering, and perishable: this is its drawback. Removing and giving up desire and greed for consciousness: this is its escape.” 

Saying\marginnote{10.15} “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question: 

“Sir,\marginnote{11.1} how does one know and see so that there’s no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli?” 

“One\marginnote{11.2} truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: \emph{all} form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ They truly see any kind of feeling … perception … choices … consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near, \emph{all} consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ That’s how to know and see so that there’s no ego, possessiveness, or underlying tendency to conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli.” 

Now\marginnote{12.1} at that time one of the mendicants had the thought: 

“So\marginnote{12.2} it seems, good sir, that form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self.\footnote{Here and in the parallel passage at MN 108, BB omits the bho, without comment. Thanissaro does likewise. However it appears in both cases, without variants. In fact the idiom iti kira is invariably followed by a vocative, so it can’t be a mistake. Horner translates it in MN 108, with the note: “This looks like a case where a monk, in thought, applies bho to himself. Or else he is thinking (as translated at K.S. iii. 88) “so then you say.” ” } Then what self will the deeds done by not-self affect?” 

Then\marginnote{12.4} the Buddha, knowing what that monk was thinking, addressed the mendicants: 

“It’s\marginnote{13.1} possible that some foolish person here—unknowing and ignorant, their mind dominated by craving—thinks they can overstep the teacher’s instructions. They think: ‘So it seems, good sir, that form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self. Then what self will the deeds done by not-self affect?’ Now, mendicants, you have been educated by me in questioning with regards to all these things in all such cases.\footnote{Once again, BB translates tatra tatra as “here and there”, though it is barely intelligible. Clearly here, as usual, a strongly distributive sense is required. } 

What\marginnote{14.1} do you think, mendicants? Is form permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{14.3} sir.” 

“Is\marginnote{14.4} feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{14.8} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{14.9} if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” 

“Suffering,\marginnote{14.10} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{14.11} if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” 

“No,\marginnote{14.13} sir.” 

“So\marginnote{14.14} you should truly see … Seeing this … They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’” 

\begin{verse}%
“Two\marginnote{15.1} on the aggregates; exactly the same; and can there be;\footnote{This is very unusual, a sutta-uddana. } \\
on the term; and on the cause; \\
two questions on identity; \\
gratification; and that with consciousness: \\
these are the ten questions \\
the mendicant came to ask.”

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

There\marginnote{1.2} Ānanda addressed the mendicants: “Reverends, mendicants!” 

“Reverend,”\marginnote{1.4} they replied. Ānanda said this: 

“Reverends,\marginnote{2.1} the venerable named \textsanskrit{Puṇṇa} son of \textsanskrit{Mantāṇī} was very helpful to me when I was just ordained. He gave me this advice: ‘Reverend Ānanda, the notion “I am” occurs because of grasping, not by not grasping.\footnote{Take care of the double nested quotes. } Grasping what? The notion “I am” occurs because of grasping form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness, not by not grasping. 

Suppose\marginnote{3.1} there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and they check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror or a clear bowl of water. They’d look because of grasping, not by not grasping. In the same way, the notion “I am” occurs because of grasping form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness, not by not grasping. 

What\marginnote{4.1} do you think, Reverend Ānanda? Is form permanent or impermanent?’ 

‘Impermanent,\marginnote{4.3} reverend.’\footnote{Note here the extreme equality in terms of address: even a newly ordained monk speaks like this to their teacher. } 

‘Is\marginnote{4.4} feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?’ 

‘Impermanent,\marginnote{4.8} reverend.’ … 

‘So\marginnote{4.9} you should truly see … Seeing this … They understand: “… there is no return to any state of existence.”’ 

Reverends,\marginnote{4.12} the venerable named \textsanskrit{Puṇṇa} son of \textsanskrit{Mantāṇī} was very helpful to me when I was just ordained. He gave me this advice. And now that I’ve heard this teaching from Venerable \textsanskrit{Puṇṇa} son of \textsanskrit{Mantāṇī}, I’ve comprehended the teaching.”

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

Now\marginnote{1.2} at that time Venerable Tissa, the Buddha’s paternal cousin, informed several mendicants: 

“Reverends,\marginnote{1.3} my body feels like it’s drugged. I’m disorientated, the teachings don’t spring to mind, and dullness and drowsiness fill my mind. I lead the spiritual life dissatisfied, and have doubts about the teachings.” 

Then\marginnote{2.1} several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. 

So\marginnote{3.1} the Buddha addressed a certain monk, “Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Tissa that the Teacher summons him.”\footnote{PTS has the usual \textsanskrit{satthā} \textsanskrit{taṁ}, \textsanskrit{āvuso} \textsanskrit{sāriputta}, \textsanskrit{āmanteti}, which is presumably omitted by mistake in MS. } 

“Yes,\marginnote{3.3} sir,” that monk replied. He went to Tissa and said to him, “Reverend Tissa, the teacher summons you.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{3.5} reverend,” Tissa replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 

“Is\marginnote{3.6} it really true, Tissa, that you informed several mendicants that your body feels like it’s drugged … and you have doubts about the teachings?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{3.8} sir.” 

“What\marginnote{3.9} do you think, Tissa? If you’re not rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for form, when that form decays and perishes, will it give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{3.12} sir.” 

“Good,\marginnote{4.1} good, Tissa!\footnote{The Buddha’s incredible skill in teaching … } That’s how it is, Tissa, when you’re not rid of greed for form. 

If\marginnote{4.4} you’re not rid of greed for feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, when that consciousness decays and perishes, will it give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?”\footnote{An obvious typo here in anigata } 

“Yes,\marginnote{5.4} sir.” 

“Good,\marginnote{6.1} good, Tissa! That’s how it is, Tissa, when you’re not rid of greed for consciousness. 

What\marginnote{6.4} do you think, Tissa? If you are rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for form, when that form decays and perishes, will it give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress?” 

“No,\marginnote{6.6} sir.” 

“Good,\marginnote{7.1} good, Tissa! That’s how it is, Tissa, when you are rid of greed for form … feeling … perception … choices … consciousness. 

What\marginnote{8.4} do you think, Tissa? Is form permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{8.6} sir.” 

“Is\marginnote{8.7} feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{8.11} sir.” 

“So\marginnote{8.12} you should truly see … Seeing this … They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ 

Suppose,\marginnote{9.1} Tissa, there were two people. One was not skilled in the path, the other was. The one not skilled in the path would question the one skilled in the path, who would reply: ‘Come, good man, this is the path. Go down it a little, and you’ll see a fork in the road. Ignore the left, and take the right-hand path.\footnote{Interesting use of muncati and ganhati. } Go a little further, and you’ll see a dark forest grove. Go a little further, and you’ll see an expanse of low-lying marshes. Go a little further, and you’ll see a large, steep cliff. Go a little further, and you’ll see level, cleared parkland.’ 

I’ve\marginnote{10.1} made up this simile to make a point. And this is what it means. 

‘A\marginnote{10.3} person who is not skilled in the path’ is a term for an ordinary unlearned person. 

‘A\marginnote{10.4} person who is skilled in the path’ is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. 

‘A\marginnote{10.5} fork in the road’ is a term for doubt. 

‘The\marginnote{10.6} left-hand path’ is a term for the wrong eightfold path, that is, wrong view … wrong immersion. 

‘The\marginnote{10.8} right-hand path’ is a term for the noble eightfold path, that is, right view … right immersion. 

‘A\marginnote{10.10} dark forest grove’ is a term for ignorance. 

‘An\marginnote{10.11} expanse of low-lying marshes’ is a term for sensual pleasures. 

‘A\marginnote{10.12} large, steep cliff’ is a term for anger and distress. 

‘Level,\marginnote{10.13} cleared parkland’ is a term for extinguishment. 

Rejoice,\marginnote{10.14} Tissa, rejoice! I’m here to advise you, to support you, and to teach you.”\footnote{Wow, that’s a major variant. It looks very much like a commentarial gloss. } 

That\marginnote{11.1} is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, Venerable Tissa was happy with what the Buddha said.

At\marginnote{1.1} one time Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. 

Now\marginnote{1.2} at that time a mendicant called Yamaka had the following harmful misconception: “As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death.” 

Several\marginnote{2.1} mendicants heard about this. They went to Yamaka and exchanged greetings with him. 

When\marginnote{2.4} the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him, “Is it really true, Reverend Yamaka, that you have such a harmful misconception: ‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death’?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{3.3} reverends, that’s how I understand the Buddha’s teaching.” 

“Don’t\marginnote{4.1} say that, Yamaka! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that.” But even though admonished by those mendicants, Yamaka obstinately stuck to that misconception and insisted on stating it. 

When\marginnote{5.1} those mendicants were unable to dissuade Yamaka from that misconception, they got up from their seats and went to see Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}. They told him what had happened, and said, “May Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} please go to the mendicant Yamaka out of compassion.” \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} consented in silence. 

Then\marginnote{5.6} in the late afternoon, Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} came out of retreat, went to Venerable Yamaka and exchanged greetings with him. Seated to one side he said to Yamaka: 

“Is\marginnote{6.1} it really true, Reverend Yamaka, that you have such a harmful misconception: ‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death’?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{6.3} reverend, that’s how I understand the Buddha’s teaching.” 

“What\marginnote{7.1} do you think, Yamaka? Is form permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{7.3} reverend.” 

“Is\marginnote{7.4} feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{7.8} reverend.” 

“So\marginnote{7.9} you should truly see … Seeing this … They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ 

What\marginnote{8.1} do you think, Reverend Yamaka? Do you regard the Realized One as form?” 

“No,\marginnote{8.3} reverend.” 

“Do\marginnote{8.4} you regard the Realized One as feeling … perception … choices … consciousness?” 

“No,\marginnote{8.9} reverend.” 

“What\marginnote{9.1} do you think, Reverend Yamaka? Do you regard the Realized One as in form?” 

“No,\marginnote{9.3} reverend.” 

“Or\marginnote{9.4} do you regard the Realized One as distinct from form?” 

“No,\marginnote{9.5} reverend.” 

“Do\marginnote{9.6} you regard the Realized One as in feeling … or distinct from feeling … as in perception … or distinct from perception … as in choices … or distinct from choices … as in consciousness?” 

“No,\marginnote{9.13} reverend.” 

“Or\marginnote{9.14} do you regard the Realized One as distinct from consciousness?” 

“No,\marginnote{9.15} reverend.” 

“What\marginnote{10.1} do you think, Yamaka?\footnote{This passage is unclear, see discussion at https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/a-problematic-reading-in-the-yamaka-sutta/2944 } Do you regard the Realized One as possessing form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?” 

“No,\marginnote{10.3} reverend.” 

“What\marginnote{11.1} do you think, Yamaka? Do you regard the Realized One as one who is without form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?” 

“No,\marginnote{11.3} reverend.” 

“In\marginnote{11.4} that case, Reverend Yamaka, since you don’t acknowledge the Realized One as a genuine fact in the present life, is it appropriate to declare: ‘As I understand the Buddha’s teaching, a mendicant who has ended the defilements is annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death.’?” 

“Reverend\marginnote{12.1} \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, in my ignorance, I used to have that misconception. But now that I’ve heard the teaching from Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} I’ve given up that misconception, and I’ve comprehended the teaching.” 

“Reverend\marginnote{13.1} Yamaka, suppose they were to ask you: ‘When their body breaks up, after death, what happens to a perfected one, who has ended the defilements?’ How would you answer?” 

“Reverend,\marginnote{13.4} if they were to ask this, I’d answer like this: ‘Reverend, form is impermanent. What’s impermanent is suffering. What’s suffering has ceased and ended. 

Feeling\marginnote{13.10} … perception … choices … consciousness is impermanent. What’s impermanent is suffering. What’s suffering has ceased and ended.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.” 

“Good,\marginnote{14.1} good, Reverend Yamaka! Well then, I shall give you a simile to make the meaning even clearer. Suppose there was a householder or householder’s son who was rich, with a lot of money and great wealth, and a bodyguard for protection. Then along comes a person who wants to harm, injure, and threaten him, and take his life. They’d think: ‘This householder or householder’s son is rich, with a lot of money and great wealth, and a bodyguard for protection. It won’t be easy to take his life by force. Why don’t I get close to him, then take his life?’ So he goes up to that householder or householder’s son and says: ‘Sir, I would serve you.’ Then they would serve that householder or householder’s son. They’d get up before him and go to bed after him, and be obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely. The householder or householder’s son would consider them as a friend and companion, and come to trust them. But when that person realizes that they’ve gained the trust of the householder or householder’s son, then, when they know he’s alone, they’d take his life with a sharp knife. 

What\marginnote{15.1} do you think, Yamaka? When that person went to the householder or householder’s son and offered to serve him, weren’t they a killer then, though he didn’t know that this was his killer? And when they got up before him and went to bed after him, being obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely, weren’t they a killer then, though he didn’t know that this was his killer? And when, knowing he was alone, they took his life with a sharp knife, weren’t they a killer then, though he didn’t know that this was his killer?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{15.12} reverend.” 

“In\marginnote{15.13} the same way, an unlearned ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons. They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They regard feeling … perception … choices … They regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. 

They\marginnote{16.1} don’t truly understand form—which is impermanent—as impermanent. They don’t truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is impermanent—as impermanent. 

They\marginnote{17.1} don’t truly understand form—which is suffering—as suffering. They don’t truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is suffering—as suffering. 

They\marginnote{18.1} don’t truly understand form—which is not-self—as not-self. They don’t truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is not-self—as not-self. 

They\marginnote{19.1} don’t truly understand form—which is conditioned—as conditioned. They don’t truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is conditioned—as conditioned. 

They\marginnote{20.1} don’t truly understand form—which is a killer—as a killer. They don’t truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is a killer—as a killer. 

They’re\marginnote{21.1} attracted to form, grasp it, and commit to the notion that it is ‘my self’. They’re attracted to feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, grasp it, and commit to the notion that it is ‘my self’. And when you’ve gotten involved with and grasped these five grasping aggregates, they lead to your lasting harm and suffering. 

A\marginnote{22.1} learned noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons. They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They don’t regard feeling … perception … choices … consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. 

They\marginnote{23.1} truly understand form—which is impermanent—as impermanent. They truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is impermanent—as impermanent. 

They\marginnote{24.1} truly understand form—which is suffering—as suffering. They truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is suffering—as suffering. 

They\marginnote{25.1} truly understand form—which is not-self—as not-self. They truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is not-self—as not-self. 

They\marginnote{26.1} truly understand form—which is conditioned—as conditioned. They truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is conditioned—as conditioned. 

They\marginnote{27.1} truly understand form—which is a killer—as a killer. They truly understand feeling … perception … choices … consciousness—which is a killer—as a killer. 

Not\marginnote{28.1} being attracted to form, they don’t grasp it, and commit to the notion that it is ‘my self’. Not being attracted to feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, they don't grasp it, and commit to the notion that it is ‘my self’. And when you’re not attracted to and don’t grasp these five grasping aggregates, they lead to your lasting welfare and happiness.” 

“Reverend\marginnote{28.7} \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, this is how it is when you have such venerables as spiritual companions to advise and instruct you out of kindness and compassion. And after hearing this teaching by Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, my mind is freed from the defilements by not grasping.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Vesālī}, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Now at that time Venerable \textsanskrit{Anurādha} was staying not far from the Buddha in a wilderness hut. Then several wanderers who follow other paths went up to Venerable \textsanskrit{Anurādha} and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to him: 

“Reverend\marginnote{1.5} \textsanskrit{Anurādha}, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them in these four ways: After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.” 

When\marginnote{2.1} they said this, Venerable \textsanskrit{Anurādha} said to those wanderers: 

“Reverends,\marginnote{2.2} when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them other than these four ways: After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.” When he said this, the wanderers said to him: 

“This\marginnote{2.5} mendicant must be junior, recently gone forth, or else a foolish, incompetent senior mendicant.” Then, after rebuking Venerable \textsanskrit{Anurādha} by calling him “junior” and “foolish”, the wanderers got up from their seats and left. 

Soon\marginnote{3.1} after they had left, \textsanskrit{Anurādha} thought: 

“If\marginnote{3.2} those wanderers were to inquire further, how should I answer them so as to repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should I explain in line with his teaching, so that there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?” 

Then\marginnote{4.1} Venerable \textsanskrit{Anurādha} went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him all that had happened. 

“What\marginnote{7.1} do you think, \textsanskrit{Anurādha}? Is form permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{7.3} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{7.4} if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” 

“Suffering,\marginnote{7.5} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{7.6} if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” 

“No,\marginnote{7.8} sir.” 

“Is\marginnote{7.9} feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{7.13} sir.” … “So you should truly see … Seeing this … They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ 

What\marginnote{8.1} do you think, \textsanskrit{Anurādha}? Do you regard the Realized One as form?” 

“No,\marginnote{8.3} sir.” 

“Do\marginnote{8.4} you regard the Realized One as feeling … perception … choices … consciousness?” 

“No,\marginnote{8.8} sir.” 

“What\marginnote{9.1} do you think, \textsanskrit{Anurādha}? Do you regard the Realized One as in form?” 

“No,\marginnote{9.3} sir.” 

“Or\marginnote{9.4} do you regard the Realized One as distinct from form?” 

“No,\marginnote{9.5} sir.” 

“Do\marginnote{9.6} you regard the Realized One as in feeling … or distinct from feeling … as in perception … or distinct from perception … as in choices … or distinct from choices … as in consciousness … or as distinct from consciousness?” 

“No,\marginnote{9.14} sir.” 

“What\marginnote{10.1} do you think, \textsanskrit{Anurādha}?\footnote{This passage is unclear, see discussion at https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/a-problematic-reading-in-the-yamaka-sutta/2944 } Do you regard the Realized One as possessing form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?” 

“No,\marginnote{10.3} sir.” 

“What\marginnote{11.1} do you think, \textsanskrit{Anurādha}? Do you regard the Realized One as one who is without form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness?” 

“No,\marginnote{11.3} sir.” 

“In\marginnote{12.1} that case, \textsanskrit{Anurādha}, since you don’t acknowledge the Realized One as a genuine fact in the present life, is it appropriate to declare: ‘Reverends, when a Realized One is describing a Realized One—a supreme person, highest of people, who has reached the highest point—they describe them other than these four ways: After death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist’?” 

“No,\marginnote{12.4} sir.” 

“Good,\marginnote{13.1} good, \textsanskrit{Anurādha}! In the past, as today, I describe suffering and the cessation of suffering.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 

Now\marginnote{1.2} at that time Venerable Vakkali was staying in a potter’s shed, and he was sick, suffering, gravely ill. 

Then\marginnote{1.3} he addressed his carers, “Please, reverends, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him: ‘Sir, the mendicant Vakkali is sick, suffering, and gravely ill. He bows with his head to your feet.’ And then say: ‘Sir, please go to the mendicant Vakkali out of compassion.’” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.8} reverend,” those monks replied. They did as he asked. The Buddha consented in silence. 

Then\marginnote{2.1} the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robes, went to Venerable Vakkali. Venerable Vakkali saw the Buddha coming off in the distance and tried to rise on his cot. 

But\marginnote{2.3} the Buddha said to him, “It’s all right, Vakkali, don’t get up. There are some seats spread out, I will sit there.” 

He\marginnote{2.6} sat on the seat spread out and said to Vakkali, “I hope you’re keeping well, Vakkali; I hope you’re alright. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.8} I’m not all right, I’m not getting by. My pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is apparent, not its fading.” 

“I\marginnote{2.9} hope you don’t have any remorse or regret?” 

“Indeed,\marginnote{2.10} sir, I have no little remorse and regret.” 

“I\marginnote{2.11} hope you have no reason to blame yourself when it comes to ethical conduct?” 

“No\marginnote{2.12} sir, I have no reason to blame myself when it comes to ethical conduct.” 

“In\marginnote{2.13} that case, Vakkali, why do you have remorse and regret?” 

“For\marginnote{2.14} a long time I’ve wanted to go and see the Buddha, but I was physically too weak.” 

“Enough,\marginnote{3.1} Vakkali! Why would you want to see this rotten body? One who sees the teaching sees me. One who sees me sees the teaching. Seeing the teaching, you see me. Seeing me, you see the teaching. 

What\marginnote{4.1} do you think, Vakkali? Is form permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{4.3} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{4.4} if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” 

“Suffering,\marginnote{4.5} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{4.6} if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” 

“No,\marginnote{4.8} sir.” 

“Is\marginnote{4.9} feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{4.13} sir.” … 

“So\marginnote{4.16} you should truly see … Seeing this … They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’” 

And\marginnote{5.1} then, after giving Venerable Vakkali this advice, the Buddha got up from his seat and went to the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. 

Then\marginnote{5.2} Venerable Vakkali addressed his carers, “Come on, reverends, lift my cot and take me to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili. It’s unthinkable for one like me to die in an inhabited area!” 

“Yes,\marginnote{5.5} reverend,” replied those mendicants, and did as he asked. Meanwhile, the Buddha spent the rest of that night and day on Vulture’s Peak Mountain. 

Then,\marginnote{5.7} late at night, two glorious deities, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. 

One\marginnote{5.8} deity said to him, “Sir, the mendicant Vakkali is intent on liberation!” 

And\marginnote{5.10} another deity said to him, “He’ll definitely be well-freed!” 

This\marginnote{5.12} is what those deities said. Then they bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right side, before vanishing right there. 

Then,\marginnote{6.1} when the night had passed, the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 

“Come,\marginnote{6.2} mendicants, go to the mendicant Vakkali and tell him: 

‘Vakkali,\marginnote{7.1} hear the word of the Buddha and two deities. 

Late\marginnote{7.2} last night, two glorious deities, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. 

One\marginnote{7.3} deity said to him, “Sir, the mendicant Vakkali is intent on liberation!”\footnote{MS lack quotes, but here it is double-nested. } 

The\marginnote{7.5} other deity said to him, “He’ll definitely be well-freed!” 

And\marginnote{7.7} the Buddha said, “Do not fear, Vakkali, do not fear! Your death will not be a bad one; your passing will not be a bad one.”’” 

“Yes,\marginnote{7.11} sir,” those monks replied. They went to Vakkali and said to him: 

“Vakkali,\marginnote{7.12} hear the word of the Buddha and two deities.” 

Then\marginnote{8.1} Vakkali addressed his carers, “Please, reverends, help me off my cot. It’s unthinkable for one like me to listen to the Buddha’s instructions sitting on a high seat.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{8.4} reverend,” replied those mendicants, and helped him off his cot. They repeated what the Buddha had said. 

Vakkali\marginnote{8.14} said, “Well then, reverends, in my name bow with your head at the Buddha’s feet. Say to him: ‘Sir, the mendicant Vakkali is sick, suffering, gravely ill. He bows with his head to your feet.’ And then say: ‘Form is impermanent. I have no doubt of that. I’m certain that what is impermanent is suffering. And I’m certain that I have no desire or greed or fondness for what is impermanent, suffering, and perishable. 

Feeling\marginnote{8.22} is impermanent … 

Perception\marginnote{8.26} is impermanent … 

Choices\marginnote{8.27} are impermanent … 

Consciousness\marginnote{8.31} is impermanent. I have no doubt of that. I’m certain that what is impermanent is suffering. And I’m certain that I have no desire or greed or fondness for what is impermanent, suffering, and perishable.’” 

“Yes,\marginnote{8.35} reverend,” those monks replied, and left. And then, not long after those mendicants had left, Venerable Vakkali slit his wrists. 

Then\marginnote{9.1} those mendicants went up to the Buddha and told him Vakkali’s message. 

Then\marginnote{10.1} the Buddha said to the mendicants, “Come, mendicants, let’s go to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili, where Vakkali, the gentleman, slit his wrists.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{10.4} sir,” they replied. 

Then\marginnote{10.5} the Buddha together with several mendicants went to the Black Rock on the slopes of Isigili. The Buddha saw Vakkali off in the distance lying on his cot, having cast off the aggregates.\footnote{See discussion https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/turning-shoulders-and-casting-off-aggregates/2949 } 

Now\marginnote{11.1} at that time a cloud of black smoke was moving east, west, north, south, above, below, and in-between. 

The\marginnote{11.2} Buddha said to the mendicants, “Mendicants, do you see that cloud of black smoke moving east, west, north, south, above, below, and in-between?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{11.4} sir.” 

“That’s\marginnote{11.5} \textsanskrit{Māra} the Wicked searching for Vakkali’s consciousness, wondering: ‘Where is Vakkali’s consciousness established?’ But since his consciousness is not established, Vakkali is extinguished.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. Now at that time Venerable Assaji was staying in a monastery built by a Kassapa, and he was sick, suffering, gravely ill. Then he addressed his carers: 

“Please,\marginnote{1.4} reverends, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him: ‘Sir, the mendicant Assaji is sick, suffering, gravely ill. He bows with his head to your feet.’ And then say: ‘Sir, please go to the mendicant Assaji out of compassion.’” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.9} reverend,” those monks replied. They did as he asked. The Buddha consented in silence. 

Then\marginnote{2.1} in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to Venerable Assaji. Venerable Assaji saw the Buddha coming off in the distance, and tried to rise on his cot. 

But\marginnote{2.4} the Buddha said to him, “It’s all right, Assaji, don’t get up. There are some seats spread out, I will sit there.” 

He\marginnote{2.7} sat on the seat spread out and said, “I hope you’re keeping well, Assaji; I hope you’re alright. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{3.1} I’m not all right, I’m not getting by. My pain is terrible and growing, not fading, its growing is evident, not its fading.” 

“I\marginnote{3.2} hope you don’t have any remorse or regret?”

“I\marginnote{3.4} hope you have no reason to blame yourself when it comes to ethical conduct?” 

“No\marginnote{3.5} sir, I have no reason to blame myself when it comes to ethical conduct.” 

“In\marginnote{3.6} that case, Assaji, why do you have remorse and regret?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{3.7} before my time of illness I meditated having completely stilled the physical process. But now I can’t get immersion. Since I can’t get immersion, I think: ‘May I not decline!’” 

“Assaji,\marginnote{3.10} there are ascetics and brahmins for whom \textsanskrit{samādhi} is the essence, equating immersion with the ascetic life. They think: ‘May we not decline!’ 

What\marginnote{4.1} do you think, Assaji? Is form permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{4.3} sir.” … 

“Is\marginnote{4.4} consciousness permanent or impermanent?” … 

“So\marginnote{4.5} you should truly see … Seeing this … They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’ 

If\marginnote{4.8} they feel a pleasant feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t relish it. If they feel a painful feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t relish it. If they feel a neutral feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t relish it. If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it detached. If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it detached. If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it detached. Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’ They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life is over, everything that’s felt, being no longer relished, will become cool right here.’ 

Suppose\marginnote{5.1} an oil lamp depended on oil and a wick to burn. As the oil and the wick are used up, it would be extinguished due to lack of fuel. 

In\marginnote{5.3} the same way, feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’ They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life is over, everything that’s felt, being no longer relished, will become cool right here.’”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time several senior mendicants were staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. Now at that time Venerable Khemaka was staying in the Jujube Tree Monastery, and he was sick, suffering, gravely ill. 

In\marginnote{1.3} the late afternoon those senior mendicants came out of retreat and addressed Venerable \textsanskrit{Dāsaka}, “Please, Reverend \textsanskrit{Dāsaka}, go to the mendicant Khemaka and say to him: ‘Reverend Khemaka, the seniors hope you’re keeping well; they hope you’re alright. They hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.’” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.7} reverends,” replied \textsanskrit{Dāsaka}. He went to Khemaka and said to him: 

“Reverend\marginnote{1.8} Khemaka, the seniors hope you’re keeping well; they hope you’re alright. They hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.” 

“Reverend,\marginnote{1.10} I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. My pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.” 

Then\marginnote{2.1} \textsanskrit{Dāsaka} went to those seniors and told them what had happened. They said, 

“Please,\marginnote{2.4} Reverend \textsanskrit{Dāsaka}, go to the mendicant Khemaka and say to him: ‘Reverend Khemaka, the seniors say that these five grasping aggregates have been taught by the Buddha, that is: the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Do you regard anything among these five grasping aggregates as self or as belonging to self?’” 

“Yes,\marginnote{3.1} reverends,” replied \textsanskrit{Dāsaka}. He relayed the message to Khemaka, who replied: 

“These\marginnote{3.6} five grasping aggregates have been taught by the Buddha, that is: the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. I do not regard anything among these five grasping aggregates as self or as belonging to self.” 

Then\marginnote{4.1} \textsanskrit{Dāsaka} went to those seniors and told them what had happened. They said: 

“Please,\marginnote{4.6} Reverend \textsanskrit{Dāsaka}, go to the mendicant Khemaka and say to him: ‘Reverend Khemaka, the seniors say that these five grasping aggregates have been taught by the Buddha, that is: the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. If, as it seems, Venerable Khemaka does not regard anything among these five grasping aggregates as self or as belonging to self, then he is a perfected one, with defilements ended.’” 

“Yes,\marginnote{5.1} reverends,” replied \textsanskrit{Dāsaka}. He relayed the message to Khemaka, who replied: 

“These\marginnote{5.6} five grasping aggregates have been taught by the Buddha, that is: the grasping aggregates of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. I do not regard anything among these five grasping aggregates as self or as belonging to self, yet I am not a perfected one, with defilements ended. For when it comes to the five grasping aggregates I’m not rid of the conceit ‘I am’. But I don’t regard anything as ‘I am this’.” 

Then\marginnote{6.1} \textsanskrit{Dāsaka} went to those seniors and told them what had happened. They said: 

“Please,\marginnote{7.1} Reverend \textsanskrit{Dāsaka}, go to the mendicant Khemaka and say to him: ‘Reverend Khemaka, the seniors ask, when you say “I am”, what is it that you’re talking about? Is it form or apart from form? Is it feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, or apart from consciousness? When you say “I am”, what is it that you’re talking about?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{8.1} reverends,” replied \textsanskrit{Dāsaka}. He relayed the message to Khemaka, who replied: 

“Enough,\marginnote{8.10} Reverend \textsanskrit{Dāsaka}! What’s the point in running back and forth? Bring my staff, I’ll go to see the senior mendicants myself.” 

Then\marginnote{9.1} Venerable Khemaka, leaning on a staff, went to those senior mendicants and exchanged greetings with them. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. They said to him: 

“Reverend\marginnote{9.3} Khemaka, when you say ‘I am’, what is it that you’re talking about? Is it form or apart from form? Is it feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, or apart from consciousness? When you say ‘I am’, what is it that you’re talking about?” 

“Reverends,\marginnote{9.10} I don’t say ‘I am’ with reference to form, or apart from form. I don’t say ‘I am’ with reference to feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, or apart from consciousness. For when it comes to the five grasping aggregates I’m not rid of the conceit ‘I am’. But I don’t regard anything as ‘I am this’. 

It’s\marginnote{10.1} like the scent of a blue water lily, or a pink or white lotus. Would it be right to say that the scent belongs to the petals or the stalk or the pistil?” 

“No,\marginnote{10.3} reverend.” 

“Then,\marginnote{10.4} reverends, how should it be said?” 

“It\marginnote{10.5} would be right to say that the scent belongs to the flower.” 

“In\marginnote{10.6} the same way, reverends, I don’t say ‘I am’ with reference to form, or apart from form. I don’t say ‘I am’ with reference to feeling … perception … choices … consciousness, or apart from consciousness. For when it comes to the five grasping aggregates I’m not rid of the conceit ‘I am’. But I don’t regard anything as ‘I am this’. 

Although\marginnote{11.1} a noble disciple has given up the five lower fetters, they still have a lingering residue of the conceit ‘I am’, the desire ‘I am’, and the underlying tendency ‘I am’ which has not been eradicated. After some time they meditate observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates. ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling … Such is perception … Such are choices … Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ As they do so, that lingering residue is eradicated. 

Suppose\marginnote{12.1} there was a cloth that was dirty and soiled, so the owners give it to a launderer. The launderer kneads it thoroughly with salt, lye, and cow dung, and rinses it in clear water. Although that cloth is clean and bright, it still has a lingering scent of salt, lye, or cow dung that had not been eradicated. The launderer returns it to its owners, who store it in a fragrant casket. And that lingering scent would be eradicated. 

In\marginnote{12.6} the same way, although a noble disciple has given up the five lower fetters, they still have a lingering residue of the conceit ‘I am’, the desire ‘I am’, and the underlying tendency ‘I am’ which has not been eradicated. After some time they meditate observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates. ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling … Such is perception … Such are choices … Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ As they do so, that lingering residue is eradicated.” 

When\marginnote{13.1} he said this, the senior mendicants said to Venerable Khemaka, “We didn’t want to trouble Venerable Khemaka with our questions. But you’re capable of explaining, teaching, asserting, establishing, clarifying, analyzing, and revealing the Buddha’s instructions in detail. And that’s just what you’ve done.” 

That’s\marginnote{14.1} what Venerable Khemaka said. Satisfied, the senior mendicants were happy with what Venerable Khemaka said. And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of sixty senior mendicants and of Venerable Khemaka were freed from defilements by not grasping.

At\marginnote{1.1} one time several senior mendicants were staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana. 

Then\marginnote{1.2} in the late afternoon, Venerable Channa came out of retreat. Taking a key, he went from dwelling to dwelling, going up to the senior mendicants and saying, “May the venerable senior mendicants advise me and instruct me! May they give me a Dhamma talk so that I can see the teaching!” 

When\marginnote{2.1} he said this, the senior mendicants said to Venerable Channa: 

“Reverend\marginnote{2.2} Channa, form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent. Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are not-self. All conditions are impermanent. All things are not-self.” 

Then\marginnote{3.1} Venerable Channa thought, “I too think in this way. … And yet my mind isn’t eager, confident, settled, and decided about the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment. Anxiety and grasping arise. And the mind reverts to thinking: ‘So then who exactly is my self?’ But that doesn’t happen for someone who sees the teaching. Who can teach me the Dhamma so that I can see the teaching?” 

Then\marginnote{4.1} Venerable Channa thought, “The Venerable Ānanda is staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. He’s praised by the Buddha and esteemed by his sensible spiritual companions. He’s quite capable of teaching me the Dhamma so that I can see the teaching. Since I have so much trust in Venerable Ānanda, why don’t I go to see him?” 

Then\marginnote{4.5} Channa set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Kosambi. He went to see Ānanda in Ghosita’s Monastery, exchanged greetings with him, and told him what had happened. Then he said, 

“May\marginnote{7.1} Venerable Ānanda advise me and instruct me! May he give me a Dhamma talk so that I can see the teaching!” 

“I’m\marginnote{8.1} already delighted with Venerable Channa. Hopefully you’ve opened yourself up and cut through your emotional barrenness.\footnote{Reading khila rather than \textsanskrit{khīla}. I think this passage has a specific Vinaya meaning: he has confessed and healed the breach in the sangha. It’s difficult to convey that sense. } Listen well, Channa. You are capable of understanding the teaching.” 

Then\marginnote{8.4} right away Channa was filled with lofty rapture and joy, “It seems I’m capable of understanding the teaching!” 

“Reverend\marginnote{9.1} Channa, I heard and learned in the presence of the Buddha his advice to the mendicant \textsanskrit{Kaccānagotta}: 

‘\textsanskrit{Kaccāna},\marginnote{9.2} this world mostly relies on the dual notions of existence and non-existence.\footnote{MS omits quote marks. Don’t forget to adjust the nesting level. } 

But\marginnote{9.3} when you truly see the origin of the world with right understanding, you won’t have the notion of non-existence regarding the world. And when you truly see the cessation of the world with right understanding, you won’t have the notion of existence regarding the world. 

The\marginnote{9.5} world is for the most part shackled by attraction, grasping, and insisting. 

But\marginnote{9.6} if—when it comes to this attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendency—you don’t get attracted, grasp, and commit to the notion “my self”, you’ll have no doubt or uncertainty that what arises is just suffering arising, and what ceases is just suffering ceasing. Your knowledge about this is independent of others. 

This\marginnote{9.9} is how right view is defined. 

“All\marginnote{9.10} exists”: this is one extreme. 

“All\marginnote{9.11} does not exist”: this is the second extreme. 

Avoiding\marginnote{9.12} these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way: 

“Ignorance\marginnote{9.13} is a condition for choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. 

When\marginnote{9.16} ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.”’” 

“Reverend\marginnote{10.1} Ānanda, this is how it is when you have such venerables as spiritual companions to advise and instruct you out of kindness and compassion. And now that I’ve heard this teaching from Venerable Ānanda, I’ve comprehended the teaching.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Ayojjhā} on the bank of the Ganges river. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.1} suppose this Ganges river was carrying along a big lump of foam. And a person with good eyesight would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully. And it would appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in a lump of foam? 

In\marginnote{2.2} the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; near or far—examining it carefully. And it appears to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in form? 

Suppose\marginnote{3.1} it was the time of autumn, when the rain was falling heavily, and a bubble on the water forms and pops right away. And a person with good eyesight would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully. And it would appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in a water bubble? 

In\marginnote{3.2} the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of feeling at all … examining it carefully. And it appears to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in feeling? 

Suppose\marginnote{4.1} that in the last month of summer, at noon, a shimmering mirage appears. And a person with good eyesight would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully. And it would appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in a mirage? 

In\marginnote{4.2} the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of perception at all … examining it carefully. And it appears to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in perception? 

Suppose\marginnote{5.1} there was a person in need of heartwood. Wandering in search of heartwood, they’d take a sharp axe and enter a forest. There they’d see a big banana tree, straight and young and grown free of defects. They’d cut it down at the base, cut off the top, and unroll the coiled sheaths. But they wouldn’t even find sapwood, much less heartwood. And a person with good eyesight would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully. And it would appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in a banana tree?\footnote{Reading akukkuccajata. Here is my note on the corresponding passage at AN 9.196: BB has “without a fruit-bud core” for \textsanskrit{akukkuccakajāta}. It’s not supported by comm or CPD. Evidently he’s following the comm for SN 22.95, where it refers to a banana tree. But I don’t even know what structure “fruit-bud core” refers to. There are multiple readings in the various contexts, but given that it follows ujum navam, I think it’s safe to assume that it’s meant to be the same word. I think it’s also safe to assume it doesn’t refer to any specific botanical structure, as these are very different trees. Most likely the term is a pseudo-synonym of uju and nava, and this fits the etymology of akukkucca, “not-ill-made”. } 

In\marginnote{5.2} the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of choices at all … examining them carefully. And they appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in choices? 

Suppose\marginnote{6.1} a magician or their apprentice was to perform a magic trick at the crossroads. And a person with good eyesight would see it and contemplate it, examining it carefully. And it would appear to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in a magic trick? 

In\marginnote{6.2} the same way, a mendicant sees and contemplates any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; near or far—examining it carefully. And it appears to them as completely void, hollow, and insubstantial. For what substance could there be in consciousness? 

Seeing\marginnote{7.1} this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’” 

That\marginnote{8.1} is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 

\begin{verse}%
“Form\marginnote{9.1} is like a lump of foam; \\
feeling is like a bubble; \\
perception seems like a mirage; \\
choices like a banana tree; \\
and consciousness like a magic trick: \\
so taught the kinsman of the Sun. 

However\marginnote{10.1} you contemplate them, \\
examining them carefully, \\
they’re void and hollow \\
when you look at them closely. 

Concerning\marginnote{11.1} this body, \\
he of vast wisdom has taught \\
that when three things are given up, \\
you’ll see this form discarded. 

Vitality,\marginnote{12.1} warmth, and consciousness: \\
when they leave the body, \\
it lies there tossed aside, \\
food for others, mindless. 

Such\marginnote{13.1} is this process, \\
this illusion, cooed over by fools. \\
It’s said to be a killer, \\
for no substance is found here. 

An\marginnote{14.1} energetic mendicant \\
should examine the aggregates like this, \\
with situational awareness and mindfulness \\
whether by day or by night. 

They\marginnote{15.1} should give up all fetters, \\
and make a refuge for themselves. \\
They should live as though their head was on fire, \\
aspiring to the imperishable state.”

Seated\marginnote{1.2} to one side, that mendicant said to the Buddha: 

“Sir,\marginnote{1.3} is there any form at all that’s permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever? Is there any feeling … perception … choices … consciousness at all that’s permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever?” 

“Mendicant,\marginnote{1.8} there is no form at all that’s permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever. There’s no feeling … perception … choices … consciousness at all that’s permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever.” 

Then\marginnote{2.1} the Buddha, picking up a lump of cow dung, said to the mendicants: 

“There’s\marginnote{2.2} not even this much of any incarnation that’s permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever. If there were, this living of the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering would not be found. But since there isn’t, this living of the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering is found. 

Once\marginnote{3.1} upon a time I was an anointed aristocratic king. I had 84,000 cities, with the capital \textsanskrit{Kusāvatī} the foremost. I had 84,000 palaces, with the palace named Principle the foremost. I had 84,000 chambers, with the great foyer the foremost. I had 84,000 couches made of ivory or heartwood or gold or silver, spread with woolen covers—shag-piled or embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red pillows at both ends.\footnote{PTS has rupiya, with a note that it is absent in Burmese edition. below our text has rupiya, so this must be an oversight. } I had 84,000 bull elephants with gold adornments and banners, covered with gold netting, with the royal bull elephant named Sabbath the foremost. I had 84,000 horses with gold adornments and banners, covered with gold netting, with the royal steed named Thundercloud the foremost. I had 84,000 chariots with gold adornments and banners, covered with gold netting, with the chariot named Triumph the foremost. I had 84,000 jewels, with the jewel-treasure the foremost. I had 84,000 women, with Queen \textsanskrit{Subhaddā} the foremost. I had 84,000 aristocrat vassals, with the counselor-treasure the foremost. I had 84,000 milk cows with silken reins and bronze pails.\footnote{Re. \textsanskrit{dukūlasandhanāni} with vll. as noted here, BB at AN 9.20 has has “jute tethers”, noting “Mp does not provide a gloss and PED does not offer a useful definition under any of those readings. But in PED \textsanskrit{sandāna} is defined as “cord, tether, fetter.””. At SN 22.96 he has “tethers of fine jute”. However, jute is a coarse cloth and can hardly be meant here. Skt dictionaries consistently say “Woven silk, silk-garment, a very fine garment in general”, which fits with our context. The only commentarial gloss I can find for this is that on SN 22.96, which says “\textsanskrit{Dukūlasandānānīti} \textsanskrit{dukūlasantharāni}”. But this yields the sense, “cover or mat”, which may be right, but is less than convincing. At MN 98, a reference missed by PTS dict, we have \textsanskrit{sandāna} as part of the equipment of a horse that is cut by one who is freed. There I render as “reins”, and this seems apt here too. } I had 8,400,000,000 fine cloths of linen, cotton, silk, and wool. I had 84,000 servings of food, which were presented to me as offerings in the morning and evening. 

Of\marginnote{4.1} those 84,000 cities, I only stayed in one, the capital \textsanskrit{Kusāvatī}. Of those 84,000 mansions, I only dwelt in one, the Palace of Principle. Of those 84,000 chambers, I only dwelt in the great foyer. Of those 84,000 couches, I only used one, made of ivory or heartwood or gold or silver. Of those 84,000 bull elephants, I only rode one, the royal bull elephant named Sabbath. Of those 84,000 horses, I only rode one, the royal horse named Thundercloud. Of those 84,000 chariots, I only rode one, the chariot named Triumph. Of those 84,000 women, I was only served by one, a maiden of the aristocratic or merchant classes.\footnote{See https://discourse.suttacentral.net/t/is-there-such-a-word-as-velamika/2952 } Of those 8,400,000,000 cloths, I only wore one pair, made of fine linen, cotton, silk, and wool. Of those 84,000 servings of food, I only had one, eating at most a serving of rice and suitable sauce. 

And\marginnote{4.11} so all those conditioned phenomena have passed, ceased, and perished. So impermanent are conditions, so unstable are conditions, so unreliable are conditions. This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions.”

“Sir,\marginnote{1.3} is there any form at all that’s permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever? Is there any feeling … perception … choices … consciousness at all that’s permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever?” 

“Mendicant,\marginnote{1.8} there is no form at all that’s permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever. There’s no feeling … perception … choices … consciousness at all that’s permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever.” 

Then\marginnote{2.1} the Buddha, picking up a little bit of dirt under his fingernail, addressed that mendicant: 

“There’s\marginnote{2.2} not even this much of any form that’s permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever. If there were, this living of the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering would not be found. But since there isn’t, this living of the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering is found. 

There’s\marginnote{3.1} not even this much of any feeling … 

perception\marginnote{4.1} … 

choices\marginnote{4.2} … 

consciousness\marginnote{5.1} that’s permanent, everlasting, eternal, imperishable, and will last forever and ever. If there were, this living of the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering would not be found. But since there isn’t, this living of the spiritual life for the complete ending of suffering is found. 

What\marginnote{6.1} do you think, mendicant? Is form permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{6.3} sir.” 

“Is\marginnote{6.4} feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{6.8} sir.” … 

“So\marginnote{6.9} you should truly see … Seeing this … They understand: ‘… there is no return to any state of existence.’”

Suppose a dog on a leash was tethered to a strong post or pillar. Whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, it stays right beside that post or pillar. 

In\marginnote{1.5} the same way, an unlearned ordinary person regards form like this: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’ They regard feeling … perception … choices … consciousness like this: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’ When walking, they walk right beside the five grasping aggregates. When standing … sitting … lying down, they lie down right beside the five grasping aggregates. 

So\marginnote{1.14} you should regularly check your own mind: ‘For a long time this mind has been corrupted by greed, hate, and delusion.’ Sentient beings are corrupted because the mind is corrupted. Sentient beings are purified because the mind is purified. 

Mendicants,\marginnote{2.1} have you seen the picture called ‘Conduct’?”\footnote{See BB’s note for the name of the picture. The commentarial explanation is hardly plausible. Surely the picture must, like very many illustrations in the ancient world, be a pedagogic device, where various kinds of conduct are depicted, perhaps with their results. } 

“Yes,\marginnote{2.2} sir.” 

“That\marginnote{2.3} picture was elaborated by the mind, but the mind is even more elaborate than that.\footnote{It is of course impossible to capture in English the pun here between citta = mind and citta = colorful. } 

So\marginnote{2.4} you should regularly check your own mind: ‘For a long time this mind has been corrupted by greed, hate, and delusion.’ Sentient beings are corrupted because the mind is corrupted. Sentient beings are purified because the mind is purified. 

I\marginnote{3.1} don’t see any other order of beings as elaborate as the animal realm.\footnote{MS punctuation is wrong, I have corrected it. } The creatures in the animal realm were elaborated by the mind, but the mind is even more elaborate than that. 

So\marginnote{3.3} you should regularly check your own mind: ‘For a long time this mind has been corrupted by greed, hate, and delusion.’ Sentient beings are corrupted because the mind is corrupted. Sentient beings are purified because the mind is purified. 

Suppose\marginnote{4.1} an artist or painter had some dye, red lac, turmeric, indigo, or rose madder. And on a polished plank or a wall or a canvas they’d create the image of a woman or a man, complete in all its various parts. 

In\marginnote{4.2} the same way, when an unlearned ordinary person creates a future life, all they create is form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. 

What\marginnote{4.3} do you think, mendicants? Is form permanent or impermanent?”

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} I say that the ending of defilements is for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not know or see. For one who knows and sees what? ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling … Such is perception … Such are choices … Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ The ending of the defilements is for one who knows and sees this. 

When\marginnote{2.1} a mendicant is not committed to development, they might wish: ‘If only my mind was freed from the defilements by not grasping!’ Even so, their mind is not freed from defilements by not grasping. Why is that? You should say: ‘It’s because they’re undeveloped.’ Undeveloped in what? Undeveloped in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path.\footnote{Note this passage is identical with AN 7.71, except “undeveloped” is absent there. } 

Suppose\marginnote{3.1} there was a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs. But she had not properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated. That chicken might wish: ‘If only my chicks could break out of the eggshell with their claws and beak and hatch safely!’ But they can’t break out and hatch safely. Why is that? Because that chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs has not properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated. 

In\marginnote{3.9} the same way, when a mendicant is not committed to development, they might wish: ‘If only my mind was freed from the defilements by not grasping!’ Even so, their mind is not freed from defilements by not grasping. Why is that? You should say: ‘It’s because they’re undeveloped.’ Undeveloped in what?

Developed in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, the four right efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven awakening factors, and the noble eightfold path. 

Suppose\marginnote{5.1} there was a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs. And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated. That chicken might not wish: ‘If only my chicks could break out of the eggshell with their claws and beak and hatch safely!’ But still they can break out and hatch safely. Why is that?

Suppose\marginnote{6.1} a carpenter or their apprentice sees the marks of his fingers and thumb on the handle of his adze. They don’t know how much of the handle was worn away today, how much yesterday, and how much previously. They just know what has been worn away. 

In\marginnote{6.5} the same way, when a mendicant is committed to development, they don’t know how much of the defilements were worn away today, how much yesterday, and how much previously. They just know what has been worn away. Suppose there was a sea-faring ship bound together with ropes. For six months they deteriorated in the water. Then in the cold season it was hauled up on dry land, where the ropes were weathered by wind and sun. When the clouds soaked it with rain, the ropes would readily collapse and rot away.\footnote{The reading vassamassani is probably a mistake. Other manuscripts have cha \textsanskrit{māsani}, and MS has that at SN 45.158, AN 7.71 too. } In the same way, when a mendicant is committed to development their fetters readily collapse and rot away.”

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} when the perception of impermanence is developed and cultivated it eliminates all desire for sensual pleasures, for rebirth in the realm of luminous form, and for rebirth in a future life. It eliminates all ignorance and eradicates all conceit ‘I am’.\footnote{The appearance here of both ruparaga and bhavaraga is unusual, perhaps unique. Normally we find ruparaga and aruparaga. } 

In\marginnote{2.1} the autumn, a farmer ploughing with a large plough shears through all the root networks.\footnote{Not sure why BB has “ploughshare” here. The ploughshare is the blade, which is \textsanskrit{nangalaphāla}. Nangala must mean the whole plough, which can be carried on a shoulder as in SN 4.19. Also, rootlets is a mistake. Rootlets are the young sprouts, but the word here is \textsanskrit{mūlasantānakāni}, where santanaka means “continuity”, i.e. “network”. } In the same way, when the perception of impermanence is developed … it eradicates all conceit ‘I am’. 

A\marginnote{3.1} reed-cutter, having cut the reeds, grabs them at the top and shakes them down, shakes them about, and shakes them off.\footnote{See my note on AN 6.53. } In the same way, when the perception of impermanence is developed … it eradicates all conceit ‘I am’. 

When\marginnote{4.1} the stalk of a bunch of mangoes is cut, all the mangoes attached to the stalk will follow along. In the same way, when the perception of impermanence is developed … it eradicates all conceit ‘I am’. 

The\marginnote{5.1} rafters of a bungalow all lean to the peak, slope to the peak, and meet at the peak, so the peak is said to be the topmost of them all. In the same way, when the perception of impermanence is developed … it eradicates all conceit ‘I am’. 

Of\marginnote{6.1} all kinds of fragrant root, spikenard is said to be the best. In the same way, when the perception of impermanence is developed … it eradicates all conceit ‘I am’. 

Of\marginnote{7.1} all kinds of fragrant heartwood, red sandalwood is said to be the best. In the same way, when the perception of impermanence is developed … it eradicates all conceit ‘I am’. 

Of\marginnote{8.1} all kinds of fragrant flower, jasmine is said to be the best. In the same way, when the perception of impermanence is developed … it eradicates all conceit ‘I am’. 

All\marginnote{9.1} lesser kings are vassals of a wheel-turning monarch, so the wheel-turning monarch is said to be the foremost of them all. In the same way, when the perception of impermanence is developed … it eradicates all conceit ‘I am’. 

The\marginnote{10.1} radiance of all the stars is not worth a sixteenth part of the moon’s radiance, so the moon’s radiance is said to be the best of them all. In the same way, when the perception of impermanence is developed … it eradicates all conceit ‘I am’. 

After\marginnote{11.1} the rainy season the sky is clear and cloudless. And when the sun rises, it dispels all the darkness from the sky as it shines and glows and radiates. In the same way, when the perception of impermanence is developed and cultivated it eliminates all desire for sensual pleasures, for rebirth in the realm of luminous form, and for rebirth in a future life. It eliminates all ignorance and eradicates all conceit ‘I am’. 

And\marginnote{12.1} how is the perception of impermanence developed and cultivated so that … it eradicates all conceit ‘I am’? ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling … Such is perception … Such are choices … Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ 

That’s\marginnote{12.7} how the perception of impermanence is developed and cultivated so that it eliminates all desire for sensual pleasures, for rebirth in the realm of luminous form, and for rebirth in a future life. That’s how it eliminates all ignorance and eradicates all conceit ‘I am’.”

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are burning chaff.\footnote{Kukkula is a rare term, and there is little early evidence for its meaning. In Pali it appears here and in SN 10.5 where it is parallel to a hell. Elsewhere too it is the name of a hell, so perhaps we should simply use “hellish”. In Skt it has the sense of “chaff, burning chaff”, but this too seems thinly attested. Nevertheless, the sight of burning off chaff of rice and other crops was probably a common one, so I accept this. See https://static.squarespace.com/static/4f334481cb12c1acadc57623/5177e444e4b0244b5f673736/5177e4a0e4b0244b5f67cd57/1266225113983/1000w/4-1.jpg I can’t find any support for BB’s “hot embers”, though. } 

Seeing\marginnote{1.3} this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. 

They\marginnote{1.5} understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”

Seeing\marginnote{1.6} this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. 

They\marginnote{1.8} understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove. The Buddha said this: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.3} when what exists, because of grasping what and insisting on what, does the view arise: ‘Winds don’t blow; rivers don’t flow; pregnant women don’t give birth; the moon and stars neither rise nor set, but stand firm like a pillar.’?” 

“Our\marginnote{2.1} teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” 

“Well\marginnote{2.2} then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{2.3} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“When\marginnote{3.1} form exists, because of grasping form and insisting on form, the view arises: ‘Winds don’t blow; rivers don’t flow; pregnant women don’t give birth; the moon and stars neither rise nor set, but stand firm like a pillar.’ When feeling … perception … choices … consciousness exists, because of grasping consciousness and insisting on consciousness, the view arises: ‘Winds don’t blow; rivers don’t flow; pregnant women don’t give birth; the moon and stars neither rise nor set, but stand firm like a pillar.’ 

What\marginnote{3.8} do you think, mendicants? Is form permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{3.10} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{3.11} if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” 

“Suffering,\marginnote{3.12} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{3.13} by not grasping what’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, would the view arise: ‘Winds don’t blow; rivers don’t flow; pregnant women don’t give birth; the moon and stars neither rise nor set, but stand firm like a pillar’?” 

“No,\marginnote{3.15} sir.” 

“Is\marginnote{4.1} feeling … perception … choices … consciousness permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{4.5} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{4.6} if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?”

“But\marginnote{4.8} by not grasping what’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, would the view arise: ‘Winds don’t blow; rivers don’t flow; pregnant women don’t give birth; the moon and stars neither rise nor set, but stand firm like a pillar’?” 

“No,\marginnote{4.10} sir.”

“No,\marginnote{4.17} sir.” 

“When\marginnote{5.1} a noble disciple has given up doubt in these six cases, and has given up doubt in suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation, they’re called a noble disciple who is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.”

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} when what exists, because of grasping what and insisting on what, does the view arise: ‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight. This person is made up of the four primary elements. When they die, the earth in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of earth. The water in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of water. The fire in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of fire. The air in their body merges and coalesces with the main mass of air. The faculties are transferred to space. Four men with a bier carry away the corpse. Their footprints show the way to the cemetery. The bones become bleached. Offerings dedicated to the gods end in ashes. Giving is a doctrine of morons. When anyone affirms a positive teaching it’s just baseless, false nonsense. Both the foolish and the astute are annihilated and destroyed when their body breaks up, and don’t exist after death’?”

They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or neutral feeling to each other. What seven? The substances of earth, water, fire, air; pleasure, pain, and the soul is the seventh. These seven substances are not made, not derived, not created, without a creator, barren, steady as a mountain peak, standing firm like a pillar. They don’t move or deteriorate or obstruct each other. They’re unable to cause pleasure, pain, or neutral feeling to each other. If you chop off someone’s head with a sharp sword, you don’t take anyone’s life. The sword simply passes through the gap between the seven substances. There are 1.4 million main wombs, and 6,000, and 600. There are 500 deeds, and five, and three. There are deeds and half-deeds. There are 62 paths, 62 sub-eons, six classes of rebirth, and eight stages in a person’s life. There are 4,900 \textsanskrit{Ājīvaka} ascetics, 4,900 wanderers, and 4,900 naked ascetics. There are 2,000 faculties, 3,000 hells, and 36 realms of dust. There are seven percipient embryos, seven non-percipient embryos, and seven embryos without attachments. There are seven gods, seven humans, and seven goblins. There are seven lakes, seven winds, seven cliffs, and 700 cliffs. There are seven dreams and 700 dreams. There are 8.4 million great eons through which the foolish and the astute transmigrate before making an end of suffering. And here there is no such thing as this: “By this precept or observance or mortification or spiritual life I shall force unripened deeds to bear their fruit, or eliminate old deeds by experiencing their results little by little”—for that cannot be. Pleasure and pain are allotted. Transmigration lasts only for a limited period, so there’s no increase or decrease, no getting better or worse. It’s like how, when you toss a ball of string, it rolls away unraveling. In the same way, after transmigrating the foolish and the astute will make an end of suffering’?”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. Then Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} for alms. He wandered for alms in \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}.

Those\marginnote{4.4} ascetics and brahmins who earn a living by running errands and messages—a wrong livelihood—are said to eat facing the cardinal directions. 

Those\marginnote{4.5} ascetics and brahmins who earn a living by palmistry—an unworthy branch of knowledge, a wrong livelihood—are said to eat facing the intermediate directions. 

I\marginnote{5.1} don’t earn a living by any of these means. I seek alms in a principled manner, and I eat it in a principled manner.” 

Then\marginnote{6.1} \textsanskrit{Sucimukhī} the wanderer went around \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} from street to street and from square to square, and announced: “The Sakyan ascetics eat food in a principled manner! The Sakyan ascetics eat food blamelessly! Give almsfood to the Sakyan ascetics!”

“Mendicant,\marginnote{2.1} it’s when some egg-born dragons think: ‘In the past we did both kinds of deeds by body, speech, and mind.

That is: the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist.”

\section*{The Translator}

Bhikkhu Sujato was born as Anthony Aidan Best on 4/11/1966 in Perth, Western Australia. He grew up in the pleasant suburbs of Mt Lawley and Attadale alongside his sister Nicola, who was the good child. His mother, Margaret Lorraine Huntsman née Pinder, said “he’ll either be a priest or a poet”, while his father, Anthony Thomas Best, advised him to “never do anything for money”. He attended Aquinas College, a Catholic school, where he decided to become an atheist. At the University of WA he studied philosophy, aiming to learn what he wanted to do with his life. Finding that what he wanted to do was play guitar, he dropped out. His main band was named Martha’s Vineyard, which achieved modest success in the indie circuit. Then it broke up, because everyone thought they personally were reason for the success, which, oddly enough, turns out not to have been the case. 

A seemingly random encounter with a roadside joey took him to Thailand, where he entered his first meditation retreat at Wat Ram Poeng, Chieng Mai in 1992. He decided to devote himself to the Buddha’s path, and took full ordination in Wat Pa Nanachat in 1994, where his teachers were Ajahn Pasanno and Ajahn Jayasaro. In 1997 he returned to Perth to study with Ajahn Brahm at Bodhinyana Monastery. 

He spent several years practicing in seclusion in Malaysia and Thailand before establishing Santi Forest Monastery in Bundanoon, NSW, in 2003. There he was instrumental in supporting the establishment of the Theravada bhikkhuni order in Australia and advocating for women’s rights. He continues to teach in Australia and globally, with a special concern for the moral implications of climate change and other forms of environmental destruction. He has published a series of books of original and groundbreaking research on early Buddhism. 

In 2005 he founded SuttaCentral together with Rod Bucknell and John Kelly. In 2015, seeing the need for a complete, accurate, plain English translation of the Pali texts, he undertook the task, spending nearly three years in isolation on the isle of Qi Mei off the coast of the nation of Taiwan. He completed the four main \textsanskrit{Nikāyas} in 2018, and the early books of the Khuddaka \textsanskrit{Nikāya} were complete by 2021. All this work is dedicated to the public domain and is entirely free of copyright encumbrance. 

In 2019 he returned to Sydney where, together with Bhikkhu Akaliko, he established Lokanta Vihara (The Monastery at the End of the World). 

\section*{Creation Process}

Primary source was the digital \textsanskrit{Mahāsaṅgīti} edition of the Pali \textsanskrit{Tipiṭaka}. Translated from the Pali, with reference to several English translations, especially those of Bhikkhu Bodhi.

\section*{The Translation}

This translation was part of a project to translate the four Pali \textsanskrit{Nikāyas} with the following aims: plain, approachable English; consistent terminology; accurate rendition of the Pali; free of copyright. It was made during 2016–2018 while Bhikkhu Sujato was staying in Qimei, Taiwan.

\section*{About SuttaCentral}

SuttaCentral publishes early Buddhist texts. Since 2005 we have provided root texts in Pali, Chinese, Sanskrit, Tibetan, and other languages, parallels between these texts, and translations in many modern languages. We build on the work of generations of scholars, and offer our contribution freely.

SuttaCentral is driven by volunteer contributions, and in addition we employ professional developers. We offer a sponsorship program for high quality translations from the original languages. Financial support for SuttaCentral is handled by the SuttaCentral Development Trust, a charitable trust registered in Australia.

\section*{About Bilara}

“Bilara” means “cat” in Pali, and it is the name of our Computer Assisted Translation (CAT) software. Bilara is a web app that enables translators to translate early Buddhist texts into their own language. These translations are published on SuttaCentral with the root text and translation side by side.
