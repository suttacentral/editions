\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” 

“Venerable\marginnote{1.5} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.1} ignorance precedes the attainment of unskillful qualities, with lack of conscience and prudence following along. An ignoramus, sunk in ignorance, gives rise to wrong view. Wrong view gives rise to wrong thought. Wrong thought gives rise to wrong speech. Wrong speech gives rise to wrong action. Wrong action gives rise to wrong livelihood. Wrong livelihood gives rise to wrong effort. Wrong effort gives rise to wrong mindfulness. Wrong mindfulness gives rise to wrong immersion. 

Knowledge\marginnote{3.1} precedes the attainment of skillful qualities, with conscience and prudence following along. A sage, firm in knowledge, gives rise to right view. Right view gives rise to right thought. Right thought gives rise to right speech. Right speech gives rise to right action. Right action gives rise to right livelihood. Right livelihood gives rise to right effort. Right effort gives rise to right mindfulness. Right mindfulness gives rise to right immersion.”

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, where they have a town named Townsville. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 

“Sir,\marginnote{1.4} good friends, companions, and associates are half the spiritual life.” 

“Not\marginnote{2.1} so, Ānanda! Not so, Ānanda! Good friends, companions, and associates are the whole of the spiritual life. A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path. 

And\marginnote{3.1} how does a mendicant with good friends develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path? It’s when a mendicant develops right view, which relies on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripens as letting go. They develop right thought … right speech … right action … right livelihood … right effort … right mindfulness … right immersion, which relies on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripens as letting go. That’s how a mendicant with good friends develops and cultivates the noble eightfold path. 

And\marginnote{4.1} here’s another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life. For, by relying on me as a good friend, sentient beings who are liable to rebirth, old age, and death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are freed from all these things. This is another way to understand how good friends are the whole of the spiritual life.”

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

Then\marginnote{1.2} Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} for alms. He saw the brahmin \textsanskrit{Jāṇussoṇi} driving out of \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in a splendid all-white chariot drawn by mares. The yoked horses were pure white, as were the ornaments, chariot, upholstery, reins, goad, and canopy. And his turban, robes, sandals were white, as was the chowry fanning him. 

When\marginnote{1.5} people saw it they exclaimed, “Wow! That’s a \textsanskrit{Brahmā} vehicle! It’s a vehicle fit for \textsanskrit{Brahmā}!” 

Then\marginnote{2.1} Ānanda wandered for alms in \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, adding, “Sir, can you point out a \textsanskrit{Brahmā} vehicle in this teaching and training?” 

“I\marginnote{4.1} can, Ānanda,” said the Buddha. 

“These\marginnote{4.2} are all terms for the noble eightfold path: ‘vehicle of \textsanskrit{Brahmā}’, or else ‘vehicle of truth’, or else ‘supreme victory in battle’. 

When\marginnote{5.1} right view is developed and cultivated it culminates with the removal of greed, hate, and delusion. When right thought … right speech … right action … right livelihood … right effort … right mindfulness … right immersion is developed and cultivated it culminates with the removal of greed, hate, and delusion. 

This\marginnote{6.1} is a way to understand how these are all terms for the noble eightfold path: ‘vehicle of \textsanskrit{Brahmā}’, or else ‘vehicle of truth’, or else ‘supreme victory in battle’.” 

That\marginnote{6.3} is what the Buddha said. 

Then\marginnote{7.1} the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 

\begin{verse}%
“Its\marginnote{8.1} qualities of faith and wisdom \\
are always yoked to the shaft. \\
Conscience is its pole, mind its strap, \\
and mindfulness its careful driver. 

The\marginnote{9.1} chariot’s equipped with ethics, \\
its axle is absorption, and energy its wheel. \\
Equanimity and immersion are the carriage-shaft, \\
and it’s upholstered with desirelessness. 

Good\marginnote{10.1} will, harmlessness, and seclusion \\
are its weapons, \\
patience its shield and armor, \\
as it rolls on to sanctuary. 

This\marginnote{11.1} supreme \textsanskrit{Brahmā} vehicle \\
arises in oneself. \\
The wise leave the world in it, \\
sure of winning the victory.”

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

Then\marginnote{1.2} several mendicants went up to the Buddha … and said to him: 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.1} sometimes wanderers who follow other paths ask us: ‘Reverends, what’s the purpose of leading the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama?’ We answer them like this: ‘The purpose of leading the spiritual life under the Buddha is to completely understand suffering.’ 

Answering\marginnote{2.5} this way, we trust that we repeat what the Buddha has said, and don’t misrepresent him with an untruth. We trust our explanation is in line with the teaching, and that there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism.” 

“Indeed,\marginnote{3.1} in answering this way you repeat what I’ve said, and don’t misrepresent me with an untruth. Your explanation is in line with the teaching, and there are no legitimate grounds for rebuke or criticism. For the purpose of leading the spiritual life under me is to completely understand suffering. 

If\marginnote{3.3} wanderers who follow other paths were to ask you: ‘Is there a path and a practice for completely understanding that suffering?’ You should answer them like this: ‘There is.’ 

And\marginnote{4.1} what is that path? It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. This is the path and the practice for completely understanding suffering. When questioned by wanderers who follow other paths, that’s how you should answer them.”

“Yes,\marginnote{1.4} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“And\marginnote{2.1} what is the noble eightfold path? It is right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 

And\marginnote{3.1} what is right view? Knowing about suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. This is called right view. 

And\marginnote{4.1} what is right thought? It is the thought of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness. This is called right thought. 

And\marginnote{5.1} what is right speech? Avoiding speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. This is called right speech. 

And\marginnote{6.1} what is right action? Avoiding killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual activity. This is called right action. 

And\marginnote{7.1} what is right livelihood? It’s when a noble disciple gives up wrong livelihood and earns a living by right livelihood. This is called right livelihood. 

And\marginnote{8.1} what is right effort? It’s when a mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have not arisen do arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are fulfilled by development. This is called right effort. 

And\marginnote{9.1} what is right mindfulness? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. This is called right mindfulness. 

And\marginnote{10.1} what is right immersion? It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. This is called right immersion.”

Because after hearing the teaching of such mendicants, a mendicant will live withdrawn in both body and mind, as they recollect and think about that teaching.

At\marginnote{5.1} such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of rapture; they develop it and perfect it. When the mind is full of rapture, the body and mind become tranquil. 

At\marginnote{6.1} such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of tranquility; they develop it and perfect it. When the body is tranquil and one feels bliss, the mind becomes immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi}. 

At\marginnote{7.1} such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of immersion; they develop it and perfect it. They closely watch over that mind immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi}. 

At\marginnote{8.1} such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of equanimity; they develop it and perfect it. 

When\marginnote{9.1} the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated in this way they can expect seven fruits and benefits. What seven? They attain enlightenment early on in this very life. If not, they attain enlightenment at the time of death. If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters, they’re extinguished between one life and the next. If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished upon landing. If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished without extra effort. If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re extinguished with extra effort. If not, with the ending of the five lower fetters they head upstream, going to the \textsanskrit{Akaniṭṭha} realm. When the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated in this way these are the seven fruits and benefits they can expect.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāketa} in the deer part at the \textsanskrit{Añjana} Wood. Then the wanderer \textsanskrit{Kuṇḍaliya} went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: 

“Master\marginnote{1.4} Gotama, I like to hang around the monasteries and visit the assemblies. When I’ve finished breakfast, it’s my habit to wander from monastery to monastery, from park to park. There I see some ascetics and brahmins speaking for the sake of winning debates and finding fault. But what benefit does Master Gotama live for?” 

“The\marginnote{1.9} benefit the Realized One lives for, \textsanskrit{Kuṇḍaliya}, is the fruit of knowledge and freedom.” 

“But\marginnote{2.1} what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill knowledge and freedom?” 

“The\marginnote{2.2} seven awakening factors.” 

“But\marginnote{2.3} what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill the seven awakening factors?” 

“The\marginnote{2.4} four kinds of mindfulness meditation.” 

“But\marginnote{2.5} what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation?” 

“The\marginnote{2.6} three kinds of good conduct.” 

“But\marginnote{2.7} what things must be developed and cultivated in order to fulfill the three kinds of good conduct?” 

“Sense\marginnote{2.8} restraint. 

And\marginnote{3.1} \textsanskrit{Kuṇḍaliya}, how is sense restraint developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the three kinds of good conduct? A mendicant sees an agreeable sight with their eye. They don’t desire it or enjoy it, and they don’t give rise to greed. Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and well freed. But if they see a disagreeable sight they’re not dismayed; their mind isn’t hardened, dejected, or full of ill will. Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and well freed. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{4.1} a mendicant hears an agreeable sound with the ear … smells an agreeable odor with the nose … tastes an agreeable flavor with the tongue … feels an agreeable touch with the body … knows an agreeable thought with their mind. They don’t desire it or enjoy it, and they don’t give rise to greed. Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and well freed. But if they know a disagreeable thought they’re not dismayed; their mind isn’t hardened, dejected, or full of ill will. Their mind and body are steady internally, well settled and well freed. 

When\marginnote{5.1} a mendicant’s mind and body are steady internally, they’re well settled and well freed when it comes to both agreeable and disagreeable sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts. That’s how sense restraint is developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the three kinds of good conduct. 

And\marginnote{6.1} how are the three kinds of good conduct developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation? A mendicant gives up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develops good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. That’s how the three kinds of good conduct are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. 

And\marginnote{7.1} how are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors? A mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. That’s how the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors. 

And\marginnote{8.1} how are the seven awakening factors developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom? A mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. That’s how the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom.” 

When\marginnote{9.1} he said this, the wanderer \textsanskrit{Kuṇḍaliya} said to the Buddha, “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sumbhas, near the town of the Sumbhas called Sedaka. Then Venerable \textsanskrit{Udāyī} went up to the Buddha … and said to him: 

“It’s\marginnote{2.1} incredible, sir, it’s amazing! How helpful my love and respect for the Buddha have been, and my sense of conscience and prudence. For when I was still a layman, I wasn’t helped much by the teaching or the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}. But when I considered my love and respect for the Buddha, and my sense of conscience and prudence, I went forth from the lay life to homelessness. The Buddha taught me the Dhamma: ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling … Such is perception … Such are choices … Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ 

Then,\marginnote{3.1} while staying in an empty hut, I followed the churning of the five grasping aggregates. I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. I comprehended the teaching; I acquired the path. When developed and cultivated as I’m living in such a way, it will bring me to such a state that I will understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ 

I\marginnote{4.1} acquired the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. When developed and cultivated as I’m living in such a way, they will bring me to such a state that I will understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ This is the path that I acquired. When developed and cultivated as I’m living in such a way, it will bring me to such a state that I will understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’” 

“Good,\marginnote{5.1} good, \textsanskrit{Udāyī}! For that is indeed the path that you acquired. When developed and cultivated as you’re living in such a way, it will bring you to such a state that you will understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”

Then\marginnote{1.1} several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} for alms. Then it occurred to him, “It’s too early to wander for alms in \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. Why don’t we go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths?” 

Then\marginnote{2.1} they went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them: 

“Reverends,\marginnote{3.1} the ascetic Gotama teaches his disciples like this: ‘Mendicants, please give up the five hindrances—corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom—and truly develop the seven awakening factors.’ We too teach our disciples: ‘Reverends, please give up the five hindrances—corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom—and truly develop the seven awakening factors.’ What, then, is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching and instruction and ours?” 

Those\marginnote{4.1} mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers who follow other paths. They got up from their seat, thinking: 

“We\marginnote{4.3} will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.” Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{8.1} when wanderers who follow other paths say this, you should say to them: ‘But reverends, is there a way in which the five hindrances become ten and the seven awakening factors become fourteen?’ Questioned like this, the wanderers who follow other paths would be stumped, and, in addition, would get frustrated. Why is that? Because they’re out of their element. I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, \textsanskrit{Māras}, and \textsanskrit{Brahmās}, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them. 

And\marginnote{9.1} what is the way in which the five hindrances become ten? Sensual desire for what is internal is a hindrance; and sensual desire for what is external is also a hindrance. That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the hindrance of sensual desire’ becomes twofold. Ill will for what is internal is a hindrance; and ill will for what is external is also a hindrance. That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the hindrance of ill will’ becomes twofold. Dullness is a hindrance; and drowsiness is also a hindrance. That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the hindrance of dullness and drowsiness’ becomes twofold. Restlessness is a hindrance; and remorse is also a hindrance. That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the hindrance of restlessness and remorse’ becomes twofold. Doubt about internal things is a hindrance; and doubt about external things is also a hindrance. That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the hindrance of doubt’ becomes twofold. This is the way in which the five hindrances become ten. 

And\marginnote{10.1} what is the way in which the seven awakening factors become fourteen? Mindfulness of internal things is the awakening factor of mindfulness; and mindfulness of external things is also the awakening factor of mindfulness. That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the awakening factor of mindfulness’ becomes twofold. 

Investigating,\marginnote{11.1} exploring, and inquiring into internal things with wisdom is the awakening factor of investigation of principles; and investigating, exploring, and inquiring into external things with wisdom is also the awakening factor of investigation of principles. That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the awakening factor of investigation of principles’ becomes twofold. 

Physical\marginnote{12.1} energy is the awakening factor of energy; and mental energy is also the awakening factor of energy. That’s how what is concisely referred to as ‘the awakening factor of energy’ becomes twofold. 

Rapture\marginnote{13.1} while placing the mind and keeping it connected is the awakening factor of rapture; and rapture without placing the mind and keeping it connected is also the awakening factor of rapture. In this way what is concisely referred to as ‘the awakening factor of rapture’ becomes twofold. 

Physical\marginnote{14.1} tranquility is the awakening factor of tranquility; and mental tranquility is also the awakening factor of tranquility. In this way what is concisely referred to as ‘the awakening factor of tranquility’ becomes twofold. 

Immersion\marginnote{15.1} while placing the mind and keeping it connected is the awakening factor of immersion; and immersion without placing the mind and keeping it connected is also the awakening factor of immersion. In this way what is concisely referred to as ‘the awakening factor of immersion’ becomes twofold. 

Equanimity\marginnote{16.1} for internal things is the awakening factor of equanimity; and equanimity for external things is also the awakening factor of equanimity. In this way what is concisely referred to as ‘the awakening factor of equanimity’ becomes twofold. This is the way in which the seven awakening factors become fourteen.”

Then\marginnote{1.1} several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} for alms. 

(The\marginnote{1.2} same as the previous discourse.) 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.1} when wanderers who follow other paths say this, you should say to them: ‘Reverends, which awakening factors should not be developed when the mind is sluggish? And which awakening factors should be developed at that time? Which awakening factors should not be developed when the mind is restless? And which awakening factors should be developed at that time?’ Questioned like this, the wanderers who follow other paths would be stumped, and, in addition, would get frustrated. Why is that? Because they’re out of their element. 

I\marginnote{3.1} don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, \textsanskrit{Māras}, and \textsanskrit{Brahmās}, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them. 

When\marginnote{4.1} the mind is sluggish, it’s the wrong time to develop the awakening factors of tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. Why is that? Because it’s hard to stimulate a sluggish mind with these things. 

Suppose\marginnote{5.1} someone wanted to make a small fire flare up. If they toss wet grass, cow-dung, and timber on it, spray it with water, and scatter dirt on it, could they make it flare up?” 

“No,\marginnote{5.4} sir.” 

“In\marginnote{6.1} the same way, when the mind is sluggish, it’s the wrong time to develop the awakening factors of tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. Why is that? Because it’s hard to stimulate a sluggish mind with these things. 

When\marginnote{7.1} the mind is sluggish, it’s the right time to develop the awakening factors of investigation of principles, energy, and rapture. Why is that? Because it’s easy to stimulate a sluggish mind with these things. 

Suppose\marginnote{8.1} someone wanted to make a small fire flare up. If they toss dry grass, cow-dung, and timber on it, blow on it, and don’t scatter dirt on it, could they make it flare up?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{8.4} sir.” 

“In\marginnote{9.1} the same way, when the mind is sluggish, it’s the right time to develop the awakening factors of investigation of principles, energy, and rapture. Why is that? Because it’s easy to stimulate a sluggish mind with these things. 

When\marginnote{10.1} the mind is restless, it’s the wrong time to develop the awakening factors of investigation of principles, energy, and rapture. Why is that? Because it’s hard to settle a restless mind with these things. 

Suppose\marginnote{11.1} someone wanted to extinguish a bonfire. If they toss dry grass, cow-dung, and timber on it, blow on it, and don’t scatter dirt on it, could they extinguish it?” 

“No,\marginnote{11.4} sir.” 

“In\marginnote{12.1} the same way, when the mind is restless, it’s the wrong time to develop the awakening factors of investigation of principles, energy, and rapture. Why is that? Because it’s hard to settle a restless mind with these things. 

When\marginnote{13.1} the mind is restless, it’s the right time to develop the awakening factors of tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. Why is that? Because it’s easy to settle a restless mind with these things. 

Suppose\marginnote{14.1} someone wanted to extinguish a bonfire. If they toss wet grass, cow-dung, and timber on it, spray it with water, and scatter dirt on it, could they extinguish it?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{14.4} sir.” 

“In\marginnote{15.1} the same way, when the mind is restless, it’s the right time to develop the awakening factors of tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. Why is that? Because it’s easy to settle a restless mind with these things. But mindfulness is always useful, I say.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where they have a town called Haliddavasana. Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Haliddavasana for alms. Then it occurred to him, “It’s too early to wander for alms in Haliddavasana. Why don’t we go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths?” 

Then\marginnote{2.1} they went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them: 

“Reverends,\marginnote{3.1} the ascetic Gotama teaches his disciples like this: ‘Come, mendicants, give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom, and meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Meditate spreading a heart full of compassion to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of compassion to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.

In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.’ 

We\marginnote{4.1} too teach our disciples in just the same way. What, then, is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching and instruction and ours?” 

Those\marginnote{5.1} mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers who follow other paths. They got up from their seat, thinking: 

“We\marginnote{5.3} will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.” Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{11.1} when wanderers who follow other paths say this, you should say to them: ‘But reverends, how is the heart’s release by love developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? How is the heart’s release by compassion developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? How is the heart’s release by rejoicing developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? How is the heart’s release by equanimity developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end?’ Questioned like this, the wanderers who follow other paths would be stumped, and, in addition, would get frustrated. Why is that?

And\marginnote{12.1} how is the heart’s release by love developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? It’s when a mendicant develops the heart’s release by love together with the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive,’ that’s what they do.

And\marginnote{13.1} how is the heart’s release by compassion developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? It’s when a mendicant develops the heart’s release by compassion together with the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.

The apex of the heart’s release by compassion is the dimension of infinite space, I say, for a mendicant who has not penetrated to a higher freedom. 

And\marginnote{14.1} how is the heart’s release by rejoicing developed? What is its destination, apex, fruit, and end? It’s when a mendicant develops the heart’s release by rejoicing together with the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go.

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

Then\marginnote{1.2} \textsanskrit{Saṅgārava} the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: 

“What\marginnote{2.1} is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why sometimes even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced? And why is it that sometimes even hymns that are long-unpracticed spring to mind, let alone those that are practiced?” 

“Brahmin,\marginnote{3.1} there’s a time when your heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire and you don’t truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen.

These\marginnote{23.1} seven awakening factors are not obstacles, hindrances, or corruptions of the mind. When developed and cultivated they lead to the realization of the fruit of knowledge and freedom. What seven? The awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity. These seven awakening factors are not obstacles, hindrances, or corruptions of the mind. When developed and cultivated they lead to the realization of the fruit of knowledge and freedom.” 

When\marginnote{24.1} he said this, \textsanskrit{Saṅgārava} said to the Buddha, “Excellent, Master Gotama! … From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. Then Prince Abhaya went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 

“Sir,\marginnote{1.4} \textsanskrit{Pūraṇa} Kassapa says this: ‘There is no cause or reason for not knowing and not seeing. Not knowing and not seeing have no cause or reason. There is no cause or reason for knowing and seeing. Knowing and seeing have no cause or reason.’ What does the Buddha say about this?” 

“Prince,\marginnote{1.10} there are causes and reasons for not knowing and not seeing. Not knowing and not seeing have causes and reasons. There are causes and reasons for knowing and seeing. Knowing and seeing have causes and reasons.” 

“But\marginnote{2.1} sir, what is the cause and reason for not knowing and not seeing? How do not knowing and not seeing have causes and reasons?” 

“There’s\marginnote{2.3} a time when the heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire, without truly knowing and seeing the escape from sensual desire that has arisen. This is a cause and reason for not knowing and not seeing. And this is how not knowing and not seeing have causes and reasons. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{3.1} there’s a time when the heart is overcome and mired in ill will … dullness and drowsiness … restlessness and remorse … doubt, without truly knowing and seeing the escape from doubt that has arisen. This is a cause and reason for not knowing and not seeing. And this is how not knowing and not seeing have causes and reasons.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{4.1} what is the name of this exposition of the teaching?” 

“These\marginnote{4.2} are called the ‘hindrances’, prince.” 

“Indeed,\marginnote{4.3} Blessed One, these are hindrances! Indeed, Holy One, these are hindrances! Overcome by even a single hindrance you wouldn’t truly know or see, let alone all five hindrances. 

But\marginnote{5.1} sir, what is the cause and reason for knowing and seeing? How do knowing and seeing have causes and reasons?” 

“It’s\marginnote{5.3} when a mendicant develops the awakening factor of mindfulness, which relies on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripens as letting go. They truly know and see with a mind that has developed the awakening factor of mindfulness. This is a cause and reason for knowing and seeing. And this is how knowing and seeing have causes and reasons. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{6.1} a mendicant develops the awakening factor of investigation of principles … energy … rapture … tranquility … immersion … equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. They truly know and see with a mind that has developed the awakening factor of equanimity. This is a cause and reason for knowing and seeing. And this is how knowing and seeing have causes and reasons.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{7.1} what is the name of this exposition of the teaching?” 

“These\marginnote{7.2} are called the ‘awakening factors’, prince.” 

“Indeed,\marginnote{7.3} Blessed One, these are awakening factors! Indeed, Holy One, these are awakening factors! Endowed with even a single awakening factor you would truly know and see, let alone all seven awakening factors. When climbing Mount Vulture’s Peak I became fatigued in body and mind. But this has now faded away. And I’ve comprehended the teaching.”

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Vesālī}, in \textsanskrit{Ambapālī}’s Wood. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” 

“Venerable\marginnote{1.5} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.1} the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment. What four? 

It’s\marginnote{2.3} when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 

They\marginnote{2.4} meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 

They\marginnote{2.5} meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 

They\marginnote{2.6} meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 

The\marginnote{2.7} four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.” 

That\marginnote{3.1} is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.1} a mendicant should live mindful and aware. This is my instruction to you. 

And\marginnote{2.3} how is a mendicant mindful? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. That’s how a mendicant is mindful. 

And\marginnote{3.1} how is a mendicant aware? It’s when a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. 

Then\marginnote{1.2} a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.” 

“This\marginnote{1.4} is exactly how some foolish people ask me for something. But when the teaching has been explained they think only of following me around.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{1.5} may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief! May the Holy One teach me the Dhamma in brief! Hopefully I can understand the meaning of what the Buddha says! Hopefully I can be an heir of the Buddha’s teaching!” 

“Well\marginnote{1.6} then, mendicant, you should purify the starting point of skillful qualities. What is the starting point of skillful qualities? Well purified ethics and correct view. When your ethics are well purified and your view is correct, you should develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation in three ways, depending on and grounded on ethics. 

What\marginnote{2.1} four? 

Meditate\marginnote{2.2} observing an aspect of the body internally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. Or meditate observing an aspect of the body externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. Or meditate observing an aspect of the body internally and externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 

Or\marginnote{2.5} meditate observing an aspect of feelings internally … externally … internally and externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 

Or\marginnote{2.8} meditate observing an aspect of the mind internally … externally … internally and externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 

Or\marginnote{2.11} meditate observing an aspect of principles internally … externally … internally and externally—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. When you develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation in these three ways, depending on and grounded on ethics, you can expect growth, not decline, in skillful qualities, whether by day or by night.” 

And\marginnote{3.1} then that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 

Then\marginnote{3.2} that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 

He\marginnote{3.3} understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And that mendicant became one of the perfected.

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.1} those mendicants who are junior—recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training—should be encouraged, supported, and established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.

“Once\marginnote{1.1} upon a time, mendicants, a hawk suddenly swooped down and grabbed a quail. And as the quail was being carried off he wailed, ‘I’m so unlucky, so unfortunate, to have roamed out of my territory into the domain of others. If today I’d roamed within my own territory, the domain of my fathers, this hawk wouldn’t have been able to beat me by fighting.’ 

‘So,\marginnote{1.5} quail, what is your own territory, the domain of your fathers?’ 

‘It’s\marginnote{1.6} a ploughed field covered with clods of earth.’ 

Confident\marginnote{1.7} in her own strength, the hawk was not daunted or intimidated. She released the quail, saying, ‘Go now, quail. But even there you won’t escape me!’ 

Then\marginnote{2.1} the quail went to a ploughed field covered with clods of earth. He climbed up a big clod, and standing there, he said to the hawk: ‘Come get me, hawk! Come get me, hawk!’ 

Confident\marginnote{2.3} in her own strength, the hawk was not daunted or intimidated. She folded her wings and suddenly swooped down on the quail. When the quail knew that the hawk was nearly there, he slipped under that clod. But the hawk crashed chest-first right there. 

That’s\marginnote{2.6} what happens when you roam out of your territory into the domain of others. 

So,\marginnote{3.1} mendicants, don’t roam out of your own territory into the domain of others. If you roam out of your own territory into the domain of others, \textsanskrit{Māra} will find a vulnerability and get hold of you. 

And\marginnote{3.3} what is not a mendicant’s own territory but the domain of others? It’s the five kinds of sensual stimulation. What five? Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing.

This is not a mendicant’s own territory but the domain of others. 

You\marginnote{4.1} should roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers. If you roam inside your own territory, the domain of your fathers, \textsanskrit{Māra} won’t find a vulnerability or get hold of you.

In some such regions, neither monkeys nor humans can go, while in others, monkeys can go but not humans. There are also level, pleasant places where both monkeys and humans can go. There hunters lay snares of tar on the monkey trails to catch the monkeys. 

The\marginnote{2.1} monkeys who are not foolhardy and reckless see the tar and avoid it from afar. But a foolish and reckless monkey goes up to the tar and grabs it with a hand. He gets stuck there. Thinking to free his hand, he grabs it with his other hand. He gets stuck there. Thinking to free both hands, he grabs it with a foot. He gets stuck there. Thinking to free both hands and foot, he grabs it with his other foot. He gets stuck there. Thinking to free both hands and feet, he grabs it with his snout. He gets stuck there. 

And\marginnote{2.12} so the monkey, trapped at five points, just lies there screeching. He’d meet with tragedy and disaster, and the hunter can do what he wants with him. The hunter spears him, pries him off that tarred block of wood, and goes wherever he wants. 

That’s\marginnote{2.14} what happens when you roam out of your territory into the domain of others.

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Vesālī}, at the little village of Beluva. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, please enter the rainy season residence with whatever friends or acquaintances you have around \textsanskrit{Vesālī}. I’ll commence the rainy season residence right here in the little village of Beluva.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.6} sir,” those mendicants replied. They did as the Buddha said, while the Buddha commenced the rainy season residence right there in the little village of Beluva. 

After\marginnote{2.1} the Buddha had commenced the rainy season residence, he fell severely ill, struck by dreadful pains, close to death. But he endured unbothered, with mindfulness and situational awareness. Then it occurred to the Buddha: 

“It\marginnote{2.4} would not be appropriate for me to become fully extinguished before informing my attendants and taking leave of the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}. Why don’t I forcefully suppress this illness, stabilize the life force, and live on?” So that is what he did. Then the Buddha’s illness died down. 

Soon\marginnote{3.1} after the Buddha had recovered from that sickness, he left his dwelling and sat in the shade of the porch on the seat spread out. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 

“Sir,\marginnote{3.3} it’s fantastic that the Buddha is comfortable, that he’s well, and that he’s alright. Because when the Buddha was sick, my body felt like it was drugged. I was disorientated, and the teachings didn’t spring to mind. Still, at least I was consoled by the thought that the Buddha won’t become fully extinguished without making some statement regarding the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of mendicants.” 

“But\marginnote{4.1} what could the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} expect from me now, Ānanda? I’ve taught the Dhamma without making any distinction between secret and public teachings. The Realized One doesn’t have the closed fist of a teacher when it comes to the teachings. 

If\marginnote{4.4} there’s anyone who thinks: ‘I’ll take charge of the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of mendicants,’ or ‘the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of mendicants is meant for me,’ let them make a statement regarding the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}. But the Realized One doesn’t think like this, so why should he make some statement regarding the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}? 

Now\marginnote{4.9} I am old, elderly and senior. I’m advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life. I’m currently eighty years old. Just as a decrepit cart keeps going by relying on straps, in the same way, the Realized One’s body keeps going by relying on straps, or so you’d think. 

Sometimes\marginnote{5.1} the Realized One, not focusing on any signs, and with the cessation of certain feelings, enters and remains in the signless immersion of the heart. Only then does the Realized One’s body become more comfortable. 

So\marginnote{5.2} Ānanda, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge. 

And\marginnote{6.1} how does a mendicant do this? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. That’s how a mendicant lives as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge. That’s how the teaching is their island and their refuge, with no other refuge. 

Whether\marginnote{6.7} now or after I have passed, any who shall live as their own island, their own refuge, with no other refuge; with the teaching as their island and their refuge, with no other refuge—those mendicants of mine who want to train shall be among the best of the best.”

Then\marginnote{1.1} Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the nuns’ quarters, and sat down on the seat spread out. Then several nuns went up to Venerable Ānanda bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.1} Ānanda, several nuns meditate with their minds firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They have realized a higher distinction than they had before.” 

“That’s\marginnote{2.2} how it is, sisters! That’s how it is, sisters! Any monk or nun who meditates with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation can expect to realize a higher distinction than they had before.” 

Then\marginnote{3.1} Ānanda educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired those nuns with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. Then Ānanda wandered for alms in \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. 

“That’s\marginnote{5.1} so true, Ānanda! That’s so true! Any monk or nun who meditates with their mind firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation can expect to realize a higher distinction than they had before. 

What\marginnote{6.1} four? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. As they meditate observing an aspect of the body, based on the body there arises physical tension, or mental sluggishness, or the mind is externally scattered. That mendicant should direct their mind towards an inspiring foundation. As they do so, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, one feels bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi}. Then they reflect: ‘I have accomplished the goal for which I directed my mind. Let me now pull back.’ They pull back, and neither place the mind nor keep it connected. They understand: ‘I’m neither placing the mind nor keeping it connected. Mindful within myself, I’m happy.’ 

Furthermore,\marginnote{7.1} a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. As they meditate observing an aspect of principles, based on principles there arises physical tension, or mental sluggishness, or the mind is externally scattered. That mendicant should direct their mind towards an inspiring foundation. As they do so, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, one feels bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi}. Then they reflect: ‘I have accomplished the goal for which I directed my mind. Let me now pull back.’ They pull back, and neither place the mind nor keep it connected. They understand: ‘I’m neither placing the mind nor keeping it connected. Mindful within myself, I’m happy.’ That’s how there is directed development. 

And\marginnote{8.1} how is there undirected development? Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’ And they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’ And they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’ Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’ And they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’ And they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’ Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’ And they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’ And they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’ Not directing their mind externally, a mendicant understands: ‘My mind is not directed externally.’ And they understand: ‘Over a period of time it’s unconstricted, freed, and undirected.’ And they also understand: ‘I meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, mindful; I am happy.’ That’s how there is undirected development. 

So,\marginnote{9.1} Ānanda, I’ve taught you directed development and undirected development. Out of compassion, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples. Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, mendicants! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction to you.” 

That\marginnote{10.1} is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, Venerable Ānanda was happy with what the Buddha said.

“\textsanskrit{Sāriputta},\marginnote{1.5} someone whose mind is free is a great man, I say. If their mind is not free, I say they’re not a great man.

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Nālandā} in \textsanskrit{Pāvārika}’s mango grove. Then \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 

“Sir,\marginnote{1.3} I have such confidence in the Buddha that I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.” 

“That’s\marginnote{1.5} a grand and dramatic statement, \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}. You’ve roared a definitive, categorical lion’s roar, saying: ‘I have such confidence in the Buddha that I believe there’s no other ascetic or brahmin—whether past, future, or present—whose direct knowledge is superior to the Buddha when it comes to awakening.’ 

What\marginnote{2.1} about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past? Have you comprehended their minds to know that those Buddhas had such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?” 

“No,\marginnote{2.3} sir.” 

“And\marginnote{3.1} what about all the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future? Have you comprehended their minds to know that those Buddhas will have such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?” 

“No,\marginnote{3.3} sir.” 

“And\marginnote{4.1} what about me, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present? Have you comprehended my mind to know that I have such ethics, or such qualities, or such wisdom, or such meditation, or such freedom?” 

“No,\marginnote{4.3} sir.” 

“Well\marginnote{5.1} then, \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, given that you don’t comprehend the minds of Buddhas past, future, or present, what exactly are you doing, making such a grand and dramatic statement, roaring such a definitive, categorical lion’s roar?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{6.1} though I don’t comprehend the minds of Buddhas past, future, and present, still I understand this by inference from the teaching. Suppose there was a king’s frontier citadel with fortified embankments, ramparts, and arches, and a single gate. And it has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and intelligent. He keeps strangers out and lets known people in. As he walks around the patrol path, he doesn’t see a hole or cleft in the wall, not even one big enough for a cat to slip out. He thinks, ‘Whatever sizable creatures enter or leave the citadel, all of them do so via this gate.’ 

In\marginnote{6.8} the same way, I understand this by inference from the teaching: ‘All the perfected ones, fully awakened Buddhas—whether past, future, or present—give up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Their mind is firmly established in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They correctly develop the seven awakening factors. And they wake up to the supreme perfect awakening.’” 

“Good,\marginnote{7.1} good, \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}! So \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, you should frequently speak this exposition of the teaching to the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. Though there will be some foolish people who have doubt or uncertainty regarding the Realized One, when they hear this exposition of the teaching they’ll give up that doubt or uncertainty.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. At that time Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} was staying in the Magadhan lands near the little village of \textsanskrit{Nālaka}, and he was sick, suffering, gravely ill. And the novice Cunda was his carer. 

Then\marginnote{2.1} Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} became fully extinguished because of that sickness. Then Cunda took \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}’s bowl and robes and set out for \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. He went to see Venerable Ānanda at Jeta’s grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.3} Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} has become fully extinguished. This is his bowl and robe.” 

“Reverend\marginnote{3.1} Cunda, we should see the Buddha about this matter. Come, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{3.3} sir,” replied Cunda. 

Then\marginnote{4.1} Ānanda and Cunda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 

“Sir,\marginnote{4.2} this novice Cunda says that Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} has become fully extinguished. This is his bowl and robe. Since I heard this, my body feels like it’s drugged. I’m disorientated, and the teachings don’t spring to mind.” 

“Well,\marginnote{5.1} Ānanda, when \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} became fully extinguished, did he take away your entire spectrum of ethical conduct, of immersion, of wisdom, of freedom, or of the knowledge and vision of freedom?” 

“No,\marginnote{5.2} sir, he did not. But Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} was my adviser and counselor. He educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired me. He never tired of teaching the Dhamma, and he supported his spiritual companions. I remember the nectar of the teaching, the riches of the teaching, the support of the teaching given by Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}.” 

“Ānanda,\marginnote{6.1} did I not prepare for this when I explained that we must be parted and separated from all we hold dear and beloved? How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out? That is not possible. 

Suppose\marginnote{6.5} there was a large tree standing with heartwood, and the largest branch fell off. In the same way, in the great \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} that stands with heartwood, \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} has become fully extinguished. 

How\marginnote{6.7} could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out? That is not possible. 

So\marginnote{6.9} Ānanda, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge.

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the \textsanskrit{Vajjīs} near \textsanskrit{Ukkacelā} on the bank of the Ganges river, together with a large \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of mendicants. It was not long after \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} and \textsanskrit{Moggallāna} had become fully extinguished. Now, at that time the Buddha was sitting in the open, surrounded by the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of mendicants. 

Then\marginnote{2.1} the Buddha looked around the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of mendicants, who were silent. He addressed them: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.2} this assembly seems empty to me now that \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} and \textsanskrit{Moggallāna} have become fully extinguished. When \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} and \textsanskrit{Moggallāna} were alive, my assembly was never empty; I had no concern for any region where they stayed. The Buddhas of the past or the future have pairs of chief disciples who are no better than \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} and \textsanskrit{Moggallāna} were to me. 

It’s\marginnote{2.7} an incredible and amazing quality of such disciples that they fulfill the Teacher’s instructions and follow his advice. And they’re liked and approved, respected and admired by the four assemblies. 

And\marginnote{2.9} it’s an incredible and amazing quality of the Realized One that when such a pair of disciples becomes fully extinguished he does not sorrow or lament. How could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out? That is not possible. 

Suppose\marginnote{2.13} there was a large tree standing with heartwood, and the largest branches fell off. In the same way, in the great \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} that stands with heartwood, \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} and \textsanskrit{Moggallāna} have become fully extinguished. 

How\marginnote{2.15} could it possibly be so that what is born, created, conditioned, and liable to wear out should not wear out? That is not possible. 

So\marginnote{2.17} mendicants, live as your own island, your own refuge, with no other refuge. Let the teaching be your island and your refuge, with no other refuge.

At\marginnote{1.1} one time, when he was first awakened, the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Uruvelā} at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the \textsanskrit{Nerañjarā} River. 

Then\marginnote{1.2} as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, “The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment. 

What\marginnote{2.1} four? A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. Or they’d meditate observing an aspect of feelings … or mind … or principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.” 

Then\marginnote{3.1} \textsanskrit{Brahmā} Sahampati knew what the Buddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the \textsanskrit{Brahmā} realm and reappeared in front of the Buddha. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: 

“That’s\marginnote{3.3} so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! Sir, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment. 

What\marginnote{4.1} four? A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.

That’s\marginnote{5.1} what \textsanskrit{Brahmā} Sahampati said. Then he went on to say: 

\begin{verse}%
“The\marginnote{6.1} compassionate one, who sees the ending of rebirth, \\

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sumbhas, near the town of the Sumbhas called Sedaka. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 

“Once\marginnote{1.3} upon a time, mendicants, an acrobat set up his bamboo pole and said to his apprentice \textsanskrit{Medakathālikā}, ‘Come now, dear \textsanskrit{Medakathālikā}, climb up the bamboo pole and stand on my shoulders.’ 

‘Yes,\marginnote{1.5} teacher,’ she replied. She climbed up the bamboo pole and stood on her teacher’s shoulders. 

Then\marginnote{1.6} the acrobat said to \textsanskrit{Medakathālikā}, ‘You look after me, dear \textsanskrit{Medakathālikā}, and I’ll look after you. That’s how, guarding and looking after each other, we’ll display our skill, collect our fee, and get down safely from the bamboo pole.’ 

When\marginnote{1.9} he said this, \textsanskrit{Medakathālikā} said to her teacher, ‘That’s not how it is, teacher! You should look after yourself, and I’ll look after myself. That’s how, guarding and looking after ourselves, we’ll display our skill, collect our fee, and get down safely from the bamboo pole.’ 

That’s\marginnote{2.1} the way,” said the Buddha. “It’s just as \textsanskrit{Medakathālikā} said to her teacher. Thinking ‘I’ll look after myself,’ you should cultivate mindfulness meditation. Thinking ‘I’ll look after others,’ you should cultivate mindfulness meditation. Looking after yourself, you look after others; and looking after others, you look after yourself. 

And\marginnote{3.1} how do you look after others by looking after yourself? By development, cultivation, and practice of meditation. And how do you look after yourself by looking after others? By acceptance, harmlessness, love, and sympathy. 

Thinking\marginnote{3.7} ‘I’ll look after myself,’ you should cultivate mindfulness meditation. Thinking ‘I’ll look after others,’ you should cultivate mindfulness meditation. Looking after yourself, you look after others; and looking after others, you look after yourself.”

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sumbhas, near the town of the Sumbhas called Sedaka. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” 

“Venerable\marginnote{1.5} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.1} suppose that on hearing, ‘The finest lady in the land! The finest lady in the land!’ a large crowd would gather. And the finest lady in the land would dance and sing in a most thrilling way. On hearing, ‘The finest lady in the land is dancing and singing! The finest lady in the land is dancing and singing!’ an even larger crowd would gather. 

Then\marginnote{2.4} a person would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain. They’d say to him, ‘Mister, this is a bowl full to the brim with oil. You must carry it in between this large crowd and the finest lady in the land. And a man with a drawn sword will follow right behind you. Wherever you spill even a drop, he’ll chop off your head right there.’ 

What\marginnote{2.9} do you think, mendicants? Would that person lose focus on that bowl, and negligently get distracted outside?” 

“No,\marginnote{2.11} sir.” 

“I’ve\marginnote{3.1} made up this simile to make a point. And this is what it means. ‘A bowl of oil filled to the brim’ is a term for mindfulness of the body. 

So\marginnote{3.4} you should train like this: ‘We will develop mindfulness of the body. We’ll cultivate it, make it our vehicle and our basis, keep it up, consolidate it, and properly implement it.’ That’s how you should train.”

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

There\marginnote{1.2} the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, at one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying near \textsanskrit{Uruvelā} at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the \textsanskrit{Nerañjarā} River. As I was in private retreat this thought came to mind: ‘The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment. 

What\marginnote{2.1} four? A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. Or they’d meditate observing an aspect of feelings … or mind … or principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.’ 

And\marginnote{3.1} then \textsanskrit{Brahmā} Sahampati, knowing what I was thinking, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the \textsanskrit{Brahmā} realm and reappeared in front of me. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said: ‘That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! Sir, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment. 

What\marginnote{4.1} four? A mendicant would meditate observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. Or they’d meditate observing an aspect of feelings … or mind … or principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.’ 

That’s\marginnote{5.1} what \textsanskrit{Brahmā} Sahampati said. Then he went on to say: 

\begin{verse}%
‘The\marginnote{6.1} compassionate one, who sees the ending of rebirth, \\
understands the path to convergence. \\
By this path people crossed over before, \\
will cross over, and are crossing over.’”

Then\marginnote{1.1} a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:

“Well\marginnote{2.2} then, mendicant, you should purify the starting point of skillful qualities. What is the starting point of skillful qualities? Live restrained in the monastic code, conducting yourself well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, keep the rules you’ve undertaken.

And\marginnote{3.7} then that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 

Then\marginnote{4.1} that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.

As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.

It’s when, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. That’s where the faculty of sadness that’s arisen ceases without anything left over. They’re called a mendicant who understands the cessation of the faculty of sadness, and who applies their mind to that end.

They’re called a mendicant who understands the cessation of the faculty of pleasure, and who applies their mind to that end.

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of \textsanskrit{Migāra}’s mother. Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and sat warming his back in the last rays of the sun. 

Then\marginnote{2.1} Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and while massaging the Buddha’s limbs he said: 

“It’s\marginnote{2.2} incredible, sir, it’s amazing, how the complexion of your skin is no longer pure and bright. Your limbs are flaccid and wrinkled, and your body is stooped. And it’s apparent that there has been a deterioration in your faculties of eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body.” 

“That’s\marginnote{3.1} how it is, Ānanda. When young you’re liable to grow old; when healthy you’re liable to get sick; and when alive you’re liable to die. The complexion of the skin is no longer pure and bright. The limbs are flaccid and wrinkled, and the body is stooped. And it’s apparent that there has been a deterioration in the faculties of eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body.” 

That\marginnote{4.1} is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 

\begin{verse}%
“Curse\marginnote{5.1} this wretched old age, \\
which makes you so ugly. \\
That’s how much this delightful puppet \\
is ground down by old age.

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

Then\marginnote{1.2} \textsanskrit{Uṇṇābha} the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: 

“Master\marginnote{2.1} Gotama, these five faculties have different scopes and different ranges, and don’t experience each others’ scope and range. What five? The faculties of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body. What do these five faculties, with their different scopes and ranges, have recourse to? What experiences their scopes and ranges?” 

“Brahmin,\marginnote{3.1} these five faculties have different scopes and different ranges, and don’t experience each others’ scope and range. What five? The faculties of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body. These five faculties, with their different scopes and ranges, have recourse to the mind. And the mind experiences their scopes and ranges.” 

“But\marginnote{4.1} Master Gotama, what does the mind have recourse to?” 

“The\marginnote{4.2} mind has recourse to mindfulness.” 

“But\marginnote{4.3} what does mindfulness have recourse to?” 

“Mindfulness\marginnote{4.4} has recourse to freedom.” 

“But\marginnote{4.5} what does freedom have recourse to?” 

“Freedom\marginnote{4.6} has recourse to extinguishment.” 

“But\marginnote{4.7} what does extinguishment have recourse to?” 

“This\marginnote{4.8} question goes too far, brahmin! You weren’t able to grasp the limit of questioning. For extinguishment is the culmination, destination, and end of the spiritual life.” 

And\marginnote{5.1} then the brahmin \textsanskrit{Uṇṇābha} approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. 

Then,\marginnote{6.1} not long after he had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Suppose there was a bungalow or a hall with a peaked roof, with windows on the eastern side. When the sun rises and a ray of light enters through a window, where would it land?” 

“On\marginnote{6.3} the western wall, sir.” 

“In\marginnote{6.4} the same way, the brahmin \textsanskrit{Uṇṇābha}’s faith in the Realized One is settled, rooted, and planted deep. It’s strong and can’t be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or \textsanskrit{Māra} or \textsanskrit{Brahmā} or by anyone in the world. If he were to pass away at this time, he would be bound by no fetter that might return him to this world.”

“Our\marginnote{2.1} teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{3.1} there is a way in which the five faculties become the five powers, and the five powers become the five faculties. 

And\marginnote{4.1} what is that method? The faculty of faith is the power of faith, and the power of faith is the faculty of faith.

The faculty of immersion is the power of immersion, and the power of immersion is the faculty of immersion. The faculty of wisdom is the power of wisdom, and the power of wisdom is the faculty of wisdom. 

Suppose\marginnote{4.7} that there was a river slanting, sloping, and inclining to the east, and in the middle was an island. There’s a way in which that river can be reckoned to have just one stream. But there’s also a way in which that river can be reckoned to have two streams. 

And\marginnote{5.1} what’s the way in which that river can be reckoned to have just one stream? By taking into account the water to the east and the west of the island, that river can be reckoned to have just one stream.

In\marginnote{6.4} the same way, the faculty of faith is the power of faith, and the power of faith is the faculty of faith. The faculty of energy is the power of energy, and the power of energy is the faculty of energy. The faculty of mindfulness is the power of mindfulness, and the power of mindfulness is the faculty of mindfulness. The faculty of immersion is the power of immersion, and the power of immersion is the faculty of immersion. The faculty of wisdom is the power of wisdom, and the power of wisdom is the faculty of wisdom. 

It’s\marginnote{6.9} because of developing and cultivating the five faculties that a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.”

When\marginnote{6.1} a noble disciple has tried again and again, recollected again and again, entered immersion again and again, and understood with wisdom again and again, they will be confident of this: ‘I have previously heard of these things.

And that a mendicant who is an adept, standing at the level of an adept, can understand that they are an adept?”

Furthermore,\marginnote{5.1} a mendicant who is a trainee understands the five faculties: faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom.

They\marginnote{1.8} generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are completed by development. These are the four right efforts. 

The\marginnote{2.1} Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east. In the same way, a mendicant who develops and cultivates the four right efforts slants, slopes, and inclines to extinguishment. 

And\marginnote{2.3} how does a mendicant who develops the four right efforts slant, slope, and incline to extinguishment? 

They\marginnote{2.4} generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t arise. 

They\marginnote{2.5} generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up.

They\marginnote{2.7} generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are completed by development.

Then\marginnote{2.1} the Buddha went up to the \textsanskrit{Cāpāla} shrine, and sat down on the seat spread out. Ānanda bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 

“Ānanda,\marginnote{3.1} \textsanskrit{Vesālī} is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, \textsanskrit{Sārandada}, and \textsanskrit{Cāpāla} Tree-shrines are all lovely. Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon. The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.” 

But\marginnote{4.1} Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. He didn’t beg the Buddha, “Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by \textsanskrit{Māra}. 

For\marginnote{5.1} a second time … and for a third time, the Buddha said to Ānanda: 

“Ānanda,\marginnote{5.3} \textsanskrit{Vesālī} is lovely. And the Udena, Gotamaka, Sattamba, Bahuputta, \textsanskrit{Sārandada}, and \textsanskrit{Cāpāla} Tree-shrines are all lovely. Whoever has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power—made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them—may, if they wish, live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon. The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them. If he wished, the Realized One could live on for the eon or what’s left of the eon.” 

But\marginnote{6.1} Ānanda didn’t get it, even though the Buddha dropped such an obvious hint, such a clear sign. He didn’t beg the Buddha, “Sir, may the Blessed One please remain for the eon! May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by \textsanskrit{Māra}. 

Then\marginnote{7.1} the Buddha said to him, “Go now, Ānanda, at your convenience.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{7.4} sir,” replied Ānanda. He rose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before sitting at the root of a tree close by. 

And\marginnote{8.1} then, not long after Ānanda had left, \textsanskrit{Māra} the Wicked went up to the the Buddha and said to him: 

“Sir,\marginnote{9.1} may the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have monk disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned, have memorized the teachings, and practice in line with the teachings. Not until they practice properly, living in line with the teaching. Not until they’ve learned their own tradition, and explain, teach, assert, establish, disclose, analyze, and make it clear. Not until they can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable basis.’ 

Today\marginnote{10.1} you do have such monk disciples. May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. 

Sir,\marginnote{11.1} you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have nun disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ … 

Today\marginnote{12.1} you do have such nun disciples. May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. 

Sir,\marginnote{13.1} you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until I have layman disciples … and laywoman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ … 

Today\marginnote{14.1} you do have such layman and laywoman disciples. May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. 

Sir,\marginnote{15.1} you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I will not become fully extinguished until my spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.’ Today your spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans. May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.” 

When\marginnote{16.1} this was said, the Buddha said to \textsanskrit{Māra}, “Relax, Wicked One. The final extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon. Three months from now the Realized One will finally be extinguished.” 

So\marginnote{17.1} at the \textsanskrit{Cāpāla} Tree-shrine the Buddha, mindful and aware, surrendered the life force. When he did so there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky. Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: 

\begin{verse}%
“Weighing\marginnote{18.1} up the incomparable against an extension of life, \\
the sage surrendered the life force. \\
Happy inside, serene, \\
he burst out of this self-made chain like a suit of armor.”

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought: ‘What’s the cause, what’s the reason for the development of the bases of psychic power?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort. They think: “My enthusiasm won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.” And they meditate perceiving continuity: as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance. 

They\marginnote{2.1} develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy … mental development … inquiry, and active effort. They think: “My inquiry won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.” And they meditate perceiving continuity: as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance.’ 

When\marginnote{5.1} the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful; controlling the body as far as the \textsanskrit{Brahmā} realm. 

When\marginnote{6.1} the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far. 

When\marginnote{7.1} the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind. They understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’, and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’. They understand mind with hate … mind without hate … mind with delusion … mind without delusion … constricted mind … scattered mind … expansive mind … unexpansive mind … mind that is not supreme … mind that is supreme … mind immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi} … mind not immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi} … freed mind … They understand unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’. 

When\marginnote{8.1} the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. 

When\marginnote{9.1} the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. 

When\marginnote{10.1} the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.”

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of \textsanskrit{Migāra}’s mother. Now at that time several mendicants were staying beneath the longhouse. They were restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties. 

Then\marginnote{2.1} the Buddha addressed Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna}, “These spiritual companions of yours staying beneath the longhouse are restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with wandering mind and undisciplined faculties. Go, \textsanskrit{Moggallāna}, and strike awe in those mendicants!” 

“Yes,\marginnote{3.1} sir,” replied \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna}. Then he used his psychic power to make the longhouse shake and rock and tremble with his toe. Then those mendicants stood to one side, shocked and awestruck. 

“It’s\marginnote{3.3} incredible, it’s amazing! There’s no wind at all; and this stilt longhouse of \textsanskrit{Migāra}’s mother has deep foundations. It’s firmly embedded, imperturbable and unshakable. And yet it shakes and rocks and trembles!” 

Then\marginnote{4.1} the Buddha went up to those mendicants and said: 

“Why\marginnote{4.2} do you, mendicants, stand to one side, shocked and awestruck?” 

“It’s\marginnote{4.3} incredible, sir, it’s amazing! There’s no wind at all; and this stilt longhouse of \textsanskrit{Migāra}’s mother has deep foundations. It’s firmly embedded, imperturbable and unshakable. And yet it shakes and rocks and trembles!” 

“Wanting\marginnote{4.5} to strike awe in you, the mendicant \textsanskrit{Moggallāna} made the longhouse shake and rock and tremble with his toe. 

What\marginnote{4.6} do you think, mendicants? What things has the mendicant \textsanskrit{Moggallāna} developed and cultivated so as to have such power and might?” 

“Our\marginnote{4.8} teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” 

“Well\marginnote{5.1} then, mendicants, listen. The mendicant \textsanskrit{Moggallāna} has become so powerful and mighty by developing and cultivating the four bases of psychic power. What four? \textsanskrit{Moggallāna} develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm … energy … mental development … inquiry, and active effort. He thinks: ‘My inquiry won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.’ And he meditates perceiving continuity: as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, he develops a mind that’s full of radiance.

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. Then \textsanskrit{Uṇṇābha} the brahmin went up to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him, “Master Ānanda, what’s the purpose of leading the spiritual life under the ascetic Gotama?” 

“The\marginnote{1.6} purpose of leading the spiritual life under the Buddha, brahmin, is to give up desire.” 

“But\marginnote{2.1} is there a path and a practice for giving up that desire?” 

“There\marginnote{2.2} is.” 

“What\marginnote{3.1} is that path?” 

“It’s\marginnote{3.2} when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm … energy … mental development … inquiry, and active effort. This is the path and the practice for giving up that desire.” 

“This\marginnote{4.1} being the case, Master Ānanda, the path is endless, not finite. For it’s not possible to give up desire by means of desire.” 

“Well\marginnote{4.3} then, brahmin, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. What do you think, brahmin? Have you ever had a desire to walk to the park, but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding desire faded away?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{4.7} sir.” 

“Have\marginnote{4.8} you ever had the energy to walk to the park, but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding energy faded away?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{4.10} sir.” 

“Have\marginnote{4.11} you ever had the idea to walk to the park, but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding idea faded away?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{4.13} sir.” 

“Have\marginnote{4.14} you ever inquired regarding a walk to the park, but when you arrived at the park, the corresponding inquiry faded away?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{4.16} sir.” 

“In\marginnote{5.1} the same way, take a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment. They formerly had the desire to attain perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding desire faded away. They formerly had the energy to attain perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding energy faded away. They formerly had the idea to attain perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding idea faded away. They formerly inquired regarding attaining perfection, but when they attained perfection the corresponding inquiry faded away. What do you think, brahmin? This being the case, is the path endless or finite?” 

“Clearly,\marginnote{6.1} Master Ānanda, this being the case, the path is finite, not endless. Excellent, Master Ānanda! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Ānanda has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}. From this day forth, may Master Ānanda remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

How\marginnote{2.1} so? It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort. They think: ‘My enthusiasm won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.’ And they meditate perceiving continuity: as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance. 

They\marginnote{2.9} develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy … mental development … inquiry, and active effort. They think: ‘My inquiry won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.’ And they meditate perceiving continuity: as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance. 

And\marginnote{3.1} what is enthusiasm that’s too lax? It’s when enthusiasm is combined with laziness. This is called lax enthusiasm. 

And\marginnote{4.1} what is enthusiasm that’s too tense? It’s when enthusiasm is combined with restlessness. This is called tense enthusiasm. 

And\marginnote{5.1} what is enthusiasm that’s constricted internally? It’s when enthusiasm is combined with dullness and drowsiness. This is called enthusiasm constricted internally. 

And\marginnote{6.1} what is enthusiasm that’s distracted externally? It’s when enthusiasm is frequently distracted and diffused externally on account of the five kinds of sensual stimulation. This is called enthusiasm distracted externally. 

And\marginnote{7.1} how does a mendicant meditate perceiving continuity: as before, so after; as after, so before? It’s when the perception of continuity is properly grasped, attended, borne in mind, and comprehended with wisdom by a mendicant. That’s how a mendicant meditates perceiving continuity: as before, so after; as after, so before. 

And\marginnote{8.1} how does a mendicant meditate as below, so above; as above, so below? It’s when a mendicant examines their own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth. ‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’ That’s how a mendicant meditates as below, so above; as above, so below. 

And\marginnote{9.1} how does a mendicant meditate as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day? It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort, with the same features, attributes, and signs by day as by night. And they develop it with the same features, attributes, and signs by night as by day. That’s how a mendicant meditates as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. 

And\marginnote{10.1} how, with an open and unenveloped heart, does a mendicant develop a mind that’s full of radiance? It’s when a mendicant has properly grasped the perception of light, and has properly grasped the perception of day. That’s how, with an open and unenveloped heart, a mendicant develops a mind that’s full of radiance. 

And\marginnote{11.1} what is energy that’s too lax? … 

And\marginnote{16.1} what is mental development that’s too lax? … 

And\marginnote{20.1} what is inquiry that’s too lax? It’s when inquiry is combined with laziness. This is called lax inquiry. 

And\marginnote{21.1} what is inquiry that’s too tense? It’s when inquiry is combined with restlessness. This is called tense inquiry. 

And\marginnote{22.1} what is inquiry that’s constricted internally? It’s when inquiry is combined with dullness and drowsiness. This is called inquiry constricted internally. 

And\marginnote{23.1} what is inquiry that’s distracted externally? It’s when inquiry is frequently distracted and diffused externally on account of the five kinds of sensual stimulation. This is called inquiry distracted externally. … That’s how, with an open and unenveloped heart, a mendicant develops a mind that’s full of radiance. When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way they’re very fruitful and beneficial. 

When\marginnote{24.1} the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, a mendicant wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again … controlling the body as far as the \textsanskrit{Brahmā} realm. When the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.”

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought: ‘What’s the path and practice for developing the bases of psychic power?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘It’s when a mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort. They think: “My enthusiasm won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.” And they meditate perceiving continuity: as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance. 

They\marginnote{1.12} develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy … mental development … inquiry, and active effort. They think: “My inquiry won’t be too lax or too tense. And it’ll be neither constricted internally nor scattered externally.” And they meditate perceiving continuity: as before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance.’ 

When\marginnote{2.1} the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, a mendicant wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again … controlling the body as far as the \textsanskrit{Brahmā} realm. 

When\marginnote{2.2} the four bases of psychic power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.”

Then\marginnote{1.2} Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 

“Sir,\marginnote{1.3} do you have personal experience of going to the \textsanskrit{Brahmā} realm by psychic power with a mind-made body?” 

“I\marginnote{1.4} do, Ānanda.” 

“But\marginnote{1.5} do you have personal experience of going to the \textsanskrit{Brahmā} realm by psychic power with this body made up of the four primary elements?” 

“I\marginnote{1.6} do, Ānanda.” 

“It’s\marginnote{2.1} incredible and amazing that the Buddha is capable of going to the \textsanskrit{Brahmā} realm by psychic power with a mind-made body! And that he has personal experience of going to the \textsanskrit{Brahmā} realm by psychic power with this body made up of the four primary elements!” 

“Ānanda,\marginnote{2.2} the Realized Ones are incredible and have incredible qualities. They’re amazing and have amazing qualities. 

Sometimes\marginnote{3.1} the Realized One submerges his body in his mind and his mind in his body. He meditates after sinking into a perception of bliss and lightness in the body. At that time his body becomes lighter, softer, more workable, and more radiant. 

Suppose\marginnote{4.1} there was an iron ball that had been heated all day. It’d become lighter, softer, more workable, and more radiant. In the same way, sometimes the Realized One submerges his body in his mind and his mind in his body. He meditates after sinking into a perception of bliss and lightness in the body. At that time his body becomes lighter, softer, more workable, and more radiant. 

Sometimes\marginnote{5.1} the Realized One submerges his body in his mind and his mind in his body. He meditates after sinking into a perception of bliss and lightness in the body. At that time his body easily rises up from the ground into the air. He wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying himself and becoming one again … controlling the body as far as the \textsanskrit{Brahmā} realm. 

Suppose\marginnote{6.1} there was a light tuft of cotton-wool or kapok. Taken up by the wind, it would easily rise up from the ground into the air.

The\marginnote{1.5} four bases of psychic power should be developed for the direct knowledge, complete understanding, finishing, and giving up of these five higher fetters. What four?

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time Venerable Anuruddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. Then as Anuruddha was in private retreat this thought came to his mind: 

“Whoever\marginnote{1.4} has missed out on these four kinds of mindfulness meditation has missed out on the noble path to the complete ending of suffering. Whoever has undertaken these four kinds of mindfulness meditation has undertaken the noble path to the complete ending of suffering.” 

Then\marginnote{2.1} Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna} knew what Venerable Anuruddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he reappeared in front of Anuruddha, and said to him: 

“Reverend\marginnote{2.3} Anuruddha, how do you define the undertaking of the four kinds of mindfulness meditation by a mendicant?” 

“Reverend,\marginnote{3.1} it’s when a mendicant meditates observing the body internally as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing the body externally as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing the body internally and externally as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 

If\marginnote{4.1} they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive,’ that’s what they do. If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive,’ that’s what they do. If they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. If they wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. 

They\marginnote{5.1} meditate observing feelings internally … externally … internally and externally as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish … 

They\marginnote{7.1} meditate observing the mind internally … externally … internally and externally as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish … 

They\marginnote{9.1} meditate observing principles internally … externally … internally and externally as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to originate and vanish … 

If\marginnote{10.1} they wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do. … If they wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, ignoring both the repulsive and the unrepulsive,’ that’s what they do.

Would they succeed?” 

“No,\marginnote{1.7} reverend. Why is that? The Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east. It’s not easy to make it slant, slope, and incline to the west. That large crowd will eventually get weary and frustrated.” 

“In\marginnote{2.1} the same way, while a mendicant develops and cultivates the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, if rulers or their ministers, friends or colleagues, relatives or family should invite them to accept wealth, saying: ‘Please, mister, why let these ocher robes torment you? Why follow the practice of shaving your head and carrying an alms bowl? Come, return to a lesser life, enjoy wealth, and make merit!’ 

It’s\marginnote{3.1} simply impossible for a mendicant who is developing and cultivating the four kinds of mindfulness meditation to resign the training and return to a lesser life. Why is that? Because for a long time that mendicant’s mind has slanted, sloped, and inclined to seclusion. So it’s impossible for them to return to a lesser life. 

And\marginnote{3.4} how does a mendicant develop the four kinds of mindfulness meditation? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body … feelings … mind … principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. That’s how a mendicant develops and cultivates the four kinds of mindfulness meditation.”

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.3} there are these four absorptions. What four? 

It’s\marginnote{1.5} when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 

As\marginnote{1.6} the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. 

And\marginnote{1.7} with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ 

Giving\marginnote{1.8} up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. 

These\marginnote{1.9} are the four absorptions. 

The\marginnote{2.1} Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines to the east. In the same way, a mendicant who develops and cultivates the four absorptions slants, slopes, and inclines to extinguishment. 

And\marginnote{2.3} how does a mendicant who develops and cultivates the four absorptions slant, slope, and incline to extinguishment? 

It’s\marginnote{2.4} when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. 

As\marginnote{2.5} the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. 

That’s\marginnote{2.8} how a mendicant who develops and cultivates the four absorptions slants, slopes, and inclines to extinguishment.”

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.3} when one thing is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. What one thing? Mindfulness of breathing. 

And\marginnote{1.6} how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated to be very fruitful and beneficial? 

It’s\marginnote{1.7} when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut. They sit down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there. 

Just\marginnote{1.8} mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. 

When\marginnote{2.1} breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ When breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling physical processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling physical processes.’ 

They\marginnote{3.1} practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing rapture.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing rapture.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing bliss.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing bliss.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling mental processes.’

“Sir,\marginnote{1.5} I develop mindfulness of breathing.” 

“But\marginnote{1.6} mendicant, how do you develop it?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{1.7} I’ve given up desire for sensual pleasures of the past. I’m rid of desire for sensual pleasures of the future. And I have eliminated perception of repulsion regarding phenomena internally and externally. Just mindful, I will breathe in. Mindful, I will breathe out.

“That\marginnote{2.1} is mindfulness of breathing, \textsanskrit{Ariṭṭha}; I don’t deny it. But as to how mindfulness of breathing is fulfilled in detail, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{2.4} sir,” \textsanskrit{Ariṭṭha} replied. The Buddha said this: 

“And\marginnote{3.1} how is mindfulness of breathing fulfilled in detail? It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut.

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.1} do you see any disturbance or trembling in that mendicant’s body?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.2} whenever we see that mendicant meditating—whether in the middle of the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} or alone in private—we never see any disturbance or trembling in his body.” 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{3.1} when an immersion has been developed and cultivated there’s no disturbance or trembling of the body or mind. That mendicant gets such immersion when he wants, without trouble or difficulty. And what is that immersion?

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.1} when immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. How so? 

It’s\marginnote{2.1} when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut. They sit down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there. Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ … They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ That’s how immersion due to mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated, is very fruitful and beneficial. 

Before\marginnote{3.1} my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too usually practiced this kind of meditation. And while I was usually practicing this kind of meditation neither my body nor my eyes became fatigued. And my mind was freed from defilements by not grasping. 

Now,\marginnote{4.1} a mendicant might wish: ‘May neither my body nor my eyes became fatigued. And may my mind be freed from grasping without defilements.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 

Now,\marginnote{5.1} a mendicant might wish: ‘May I give up memories and thoughts of the lay life.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 

Now,\marginnote{6.1} a mendicant might wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 

Now,\marginnote{7.1} a mendicant might wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 

Now,\marginnote{8.1} a mendicant might wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the repulsive in the unrepulsive and the repulsive.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 

Now,\marginnote{9.1} a mendicant might wish: ‘May I meditate perceiving the unrepulsive in the repulsive and the unrepulsive.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 

Now,\marginnote{10.1} a mendicant might wish: ‘May I meditate staying equanimous, mindful and aware, rejecting both the repulsive and the unrepulsive.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 

Now,\marginnote{11.1} a mendicant might wish: ‘Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, may I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 

Now,\marginnote{12.1} a mendicant might wish: ‘As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, may I enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 

Now,\marginnote{13.1} a mendicant might wish: ‘With the fading away of rapture, may I enter and remain in the third absorption, where I will meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, “Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.”’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 

Now,\marginnote{14.1} a mendicant might wish: ‘With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, may I enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 

Now,\marginnote{15.1} a mendicant might wish: ‘Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that “space is infinite”, may I enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 

Now,\marginnote{16.1} a mendicant might wish: ‘Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that “consciousness is infinite”, may I enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 

Now,\marginnote{17.1} a mendicant might wish: ‘Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that “there is nothing at all”, may I enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 

Now,\marginnote{18.1} a mendicant might wish: ‘Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, may I enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 

Now,\marginnote{19.1} a mendicant might wish: ‘Going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, may I enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling.’ So let them closely focus on this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 

When\marginnote{20.1} mindfulness of breathing has been developed and cultivated in this way, if they feel a pleasant feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. If they feel a painful feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. If they feel a neutral feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. 

If\marginnote{21.1} they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it detached. If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it detached. If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it detached. Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’ They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here.’ 

Suppose\marginnote{22.1} an oil lamp depended on oil and a wick to burn. As the oil and the wick are used up, it would be extinguished due to lack of fuel. In the same way, feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’ They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here.’”

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Vesālī}, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Now at that time the Buddha spoke in many ways to the mendicants about the meditation on ugliness. He praised the meditation on ugliness and its development. 

Then\marginnote{2.1} the Buddha said to the mendicants, “Mendicants, I wish to go on retreat for a fortnight. No-one should approach me, except for the one who brings my almsfood.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{2.4} sir,” replied those mendicants. And no-one approached him, except for the one who brought the almsfood. 

Then\marginnote{3.1} those mendicants thought, “The Buddha spoke in many ways about the meditation on ugliness. He praised the meditation on ugliness and its development.” They committed themselves to developing the many different facets of the meditation on ugliness. Becoming horrified, repelled, and disgusted with this body, they looked for someone to slit their wrists. Each day ten, twenty, or thirty mendicants slit their wrists. 

Then\marginnote{4.1} after a fortnight had passed, the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed Ānanda, “Ānanda, why does the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} seem so diminished?” 

Ānanda\marginnote{4.3} told the Buddha all that had happened, and said, “Sir, please explain another way for the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} to get enlightened.” 

“Well\marginnote{5.1} then, Ānanda, gather all the mendicants staying in the vicinity of \textsanskrit{Vesālī} together in the assembly hall.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{5.2} sir,” replied Ānanda. He did what the Buddha asked, went up to him, and said, “Sir, the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} has assembled. Please, sir, come at your convenience.” 

Then\marginnote{6.1} the Buddha went to the assembly hall, sat down on the seat spread out, and addressed the mendicants: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{6.3} when this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it’s peaceful and sublime, a deliciously pleasant meditation. And it disperses and settles unskillful qualities on the spot whenever they arise. 

In\marginnote{7.1} the last month of summer, when the dust and dirt is stirred up, a large sudden storm disperses and settles it on the spot. 

In\marginnote{7.2} the same way, when this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated it’s peaceful and sublime, a deliciously pleasant meditation. And it disperses and settles unskillful qualities on the spot whenever they arise. And how is it so developed and cultivated? 

It’s\marginnote{8.1} when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and focuses their mindfulness right there. 

Just\marginnote{8.2} mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. … 

They\marginnote{8.3} practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ 

That’s\marginnote{8.4} how this immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated so that it’s peaceful and sublime, a deliciously pleasant meditation. And it disperses and settles unskillful qualities on the spot whenever they arise.”

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Kimbilā} in the Freshwater Mangrove Wood. Then the Buddha said to Venerable Kimbila, “Kimbila, how is immersion due to mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is very fruitful and beneficial?” 

When\marginnote{2.1} he said this, Kimbila kept silent. 

For\marginnote{2.2} a second time … 

And\marginnote{2.3} for a third time, the Buddha said to him, “How is immersion due to mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is very fruitful and beneficial?” And a second time and a third time Kimbila kept silent. 

When\marginnote{3.1} he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, “Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! Let the Buddha speak on immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” 

“Well\marginnote{4.1} then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{4.2} sir,” Ānanda replied. The Buddha said this: 

“Ānanda,\marginnote{4.4} how is immersion due to mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so that it is very fruitful and beneficial? It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establishes mindfulness right there. 

Just\marginnote{4.6} mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. … 

They\marginnote{4.7} practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ That’s how immersion due to mindfulness of breathing, when developed and cultivated, is very fruitful and beneficial. 

When\marginnote{5.1} a mendicant is breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ When breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the physical process.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the physical process.’ At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. Why is that? Because the breath is a certain aspect of the body, I say. Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 

There’s\marginnote{6.1} a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing rapture.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing rapture.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing bliss.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing bliss.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the mental processes.’ At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. Why is that? Because close focus on the breath is a certain aspect of feelings, I say. Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 

There’s\marginnote{7.1} a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in gladdening the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out gladdening the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in immersing the mind in \textsanskrit{samādhi}.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out immersing the mind in \textsanskrit{samādhi}.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in freeing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out freeing the mind.’ At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. Why is that? Because there is no development of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing for someone who is unmindful and lacks awareness, I say. Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 

There’s\marginnote{8.1} a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing impermanence.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing impermanence.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing fading away.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing fading away.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing cessation.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing cessation.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. Having seen with wisdom the giving up of desire and aversion, they watch closely over with equanimity. Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 

Suppose\marginnote{9.1} there was a large heap of sand at the crossroads. And a cart or chariot were to come by from the east, west, north, or south and destroy that heap of sand. 

In\marginnote{9.6} the same way, when a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body, feelings, mind, or principles, they destroy bad, unskillful qualities.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying in a forest near \textsanskrit{Icchānaṅgala}. There he addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants, I wish to go on retreat for three months. No-one should approach me, except for the one who brings my almsfood.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.5} sir,” replied those mendicants. And no-one approached him, except for the one who brought the almsfood. 

Then\marginnote{2.1} after three months had passed, the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed the mendicants: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.2} if wanderers who follow another path were to ask you: ‘Reverends, what was the ascetic Gotama’s usual meditation during the rainy season residence?’ You should answer them like this. ‘Reverends, the ascetic Gotama’s usual meditation during the rainy season residence was immersion due to mindfulness of breathing.’ 

In\marginnote{2.5} this regard: mindful, I breathe in. Mindful, I breathe out. 

When\marginnote{2.6} breathing in heavily I know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily I know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ When breathing in lightly I know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ When breathing out lightly I know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’ I know: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ …

For\marginnote{3.1} if anything should be rightly called ‘the meditation of a noble one’, or else ‘the meditation of a \textsanskrit{Brahmā}’, or else ‘the meditation of a realized one’, it’s immersion due to mindfulness of breathing. 

For\marginnote{3.5} those mendicants who are trainees—who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary—the development and cultivation of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing leads to the ending of defilements. 

For\marginnote{3.6} those mendicants who are perfected—who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment—the development and cultivation of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing leads to blissful meditation in the present life, and to mindfulness and awareness.

At\marginnote{1.1} one time Venerable \textsanskrit{Lomasavaṅgīsa} was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Then \textsanskrit{Mahānāma} the Sakyan went up to Venerable \textsanskrit{Lomasavaṅgīsa}, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, is the meditation of a trainee just the same as the meditation of a Realized One? Or is the meditation of a trainee different from the meditation of a Realized One?” 

“Reverend\marginnote{2.1} \textsanskrit{Mahānāma}, the meditation of a trainee and a realized one are not the same; they are different. Those mendicants who are trainees haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring for the supreme sanctuary. They meditate after giving up the five hindrances. What five? The hindrances of sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. 

Those\marginnote{3.1} who are trainee mendicants … meditate after giving up the five hindrances. 

Those\marginnote{4.1} mendicants who are perfected—who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment—for them, the five hindrances are cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. What five? The hindrances of sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. 

Those\marginnote{5.1} mendicants who are perfected—who have ended the defilements … for them, the five hindrances are cut off at the root … and unable to arise in the future. And here’s another way to understand how the meditation of a trainee and a realized one are different. 

At\marginnote{6.1} one time the Buddha was staying in a forest near \textsanskrit{Icchānaṅgala}. There he addressed the mendicants, ‘Mendicants, I wish to go on retreat for three months. No-one should approach me, except for the one who brings my almsfood.’ 

‘Yes,\marginnote{6.5} sir,’ replied those mendicants. And no-one approached him, except for the one who brought the almsfood.

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

Then\marginnote{1.2} Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 

“Sir,\marginnote{1.3} is there one thing that, when developed and cultivated, fulfills four things; and those four things, when developed and cultivated, fulfill seven things; and those seven things, when developed and cultivated, fulfill two things?” 

“There\marginnote{2.1} is, Ānanda.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{3.1} what is that one thing?” 

“Immersion\marginnote{3.2} due to mindfulness of breathing is one thing that, when developed and cultivated, fulfills the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. And the four kinds of mindfulness meditation, when developed and cultivated, fulfill the seven awakening factors. And the seven awakening factors, when developed and cultivated, fulfill knowledge and freedom. 

And\marginnote{4.1} how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation? It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and establishes mindfulness right there. Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ … They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ 

When\marginnote{5.1} a mendicant is breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ … They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the physical process.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the physical process.’ At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. Why is that? Because the breath is a certain aspect of the body, I say. Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 

There’s\marginnote{6.1} a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing rapture … bliss … mind …’ … They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the mental processes.’ At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. Why is that? Because close focus on the breath is a certain aspect of feelings, I say. Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 

There’s\marginnote{7.1} a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in gladdening the mind … immersing the mind in \textsanskrit{samādhi} … freeing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out freeing the mind.’ At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. Why is that? Because there is no development of immersion due to mindfulness of breathing for someone who is unmindful and lacks awareness, I say. Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 

There’s\marginnote{8.1} a time when a mendicant practices like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing impermanence … fading away … cessation … letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ At such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. Having seen with wisdom the giving up of desire and aversion, they watch closely over with equanimity. Therefore, at such a time a mendicant is meditating by observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. 

That’s\marginnote{9.1} how immersion due to mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. 

And\marginnote{10.1} how are the four kinds of mindfulness meditation developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors? Whenever a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body, their mindfulness is established and lucid. At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of mindfulness; they develop it and perfect it. 

As\marginnote{11.1} they live mindfully in this way they investigate, explore, and inquire into that principle with wisdom. At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of investigation of principles; they develop it and perfect it. 

As\marginnote{12.1} they investigate principles with wisdom in this way their energy is roused up and unflagging. At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of energy; they develop it and perfect it. 

When\marginnote{13.1} you’re energetic, spiritual rapture arises. At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of rapture; they develop it and perfect it. 

When\marginnote{14.1} the mind is full of rapture, the body and mind become tranquil. At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of tranquility; they develop it and perfect it. 

When\marginnote{15.1} the body is tranquil and one feels bliss, the mind becomes immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi}. At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of immersion; they develop it and perfect it. 

They\marginnote{16.1} closely watch over that mind immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi}. At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of equanimity; they develop it and perfect it. 

Whenever\marginnote{17.1} a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of feelings … mind … principles, their mindfulness is established and lucid. At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of mindfulness; they develop it and perfect it. … 

(This\marginnote{17.7} should be told in full as for the first kind of mindfulness meditation.) 

They\marginnote{18.1} closely watch over that mind immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi}. At such a time, a mendicant has activated the awakening factor of equanimity; they develop it and perfect it. That’s how the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill the seven awakening factors. 

And\marginnote{19.1} how are the seven awakening factors developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom? It’s when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. That’s how the seven awakening factors are developed and cultivated so as to fulfill knowledge and freedom.”

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

There\marginnote{1.2} the Buddha … said: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.3} suppose a wheel-turning monarch were to rule as sovereign lord over these four continents. And when his body breaks up, after death, he’s reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the gods of the Thirty-Three. There he entertains himself in the Garden of Delight, escorted by a band of nymphs, and supplied and provided with the five kinds of heavenly sensual stimulation. Still, as he’s lacking four things, he’s not exempt from hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm. He’s not exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld. 

Now\marginnote{1.4} suppose a noble disciple wears rags and feeds on scraps of almsfood. Still, as they have four things, they’re exempt from hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld. 

What\marginnote{2.1} four? It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 

They\marginnote{2.4} have experiential confidence in the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ 

They\marginnote{2.6} have experiential confidence in the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}: ‘The \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ 

Furthermore,\marginnote{2.8} a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. 

These\marginnote{2.9} are the four factors of stream-entry that they have. 

And,\marginnote{2.10} mendicants, gaining these four continents is not worth a sixteenth part of gaining these four things.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 

Now\marginnote{1.2} at that time the lay follower \textsanskrit{Dhīgāvu} was sick, suffering, gravely ill. Then he addressed his father, the householder Jotika, “Please, householder, go to the Buddha, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him: ‘Sir, the lay follower \textsanskrit{Dhīgāvu} is sick, suffering, gravely ill. He bows with his head to your feet.’ And then say: ‘Sir, please visit him at his home out of compassion.’” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.9} dear,” replied Jotika. He did as \textsanskrit{Dīghāvu} asked. The Buddha consented in silence. 

Then\marginnote{2.1} the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the lay follower \textsanskrit{Dīghāvu}, sat down on the seat spread out, and said to him, “I hope you’re keeping well, \textsanskrit{Dīghāvu}; I hope you’re alright. I hope that your pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.3} I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.” 

“So,\marginnote{2.4} \textsanskrit{Dīghāvu}, you should train like this: ‘I will have experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} … And I will have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.’ That’s how you should train.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{3.1} these four factors of stream-entry that were taught by the Buddha are found in me, and I am seen in them. For I have experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} … And I have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.” 

“In\marginnote{3.6} that case, \textsanskrit{Dīghāvu}, grounded on these four factors of stream-entry you should further develop these six things that play a part in realization. You should meditate observing the impermanence of all conditions, perceiving suffering in impermanence, perceiving not-self in suffering, perceiving giving up, perceiving fading away, and perceiving cessation. That’s how you should train.” 

“These\marginnote{4.1} six things that play a part in realization that were taught by the Buddha are found in me, and I embody them. For I meditate observing the impermanence of all conditions, perceiving suffering in impermanence, perceiving not-self in suffering, perceiving giving up, perceiving fading away, and perceiving cessation. 

But\marginnote{4.3} still, sir, I think, ‘I hope Jotika doesn’t suffer anguish when I’ve gone.’” Jotika said, “Dear \textsanskrit{Dīghāvu}, don’t focus on that. Come on, dear \textsanskrit{Dīghāvu}, you should closely focus on what the Buddha is saying.” 

When\marginnote{5.1} the Buddha had given this advice he got up from his seat and left. Not long after the Buddha left, \textsanskrit{Dīghāvu} passed away. Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 

“Sir,\marginnote{5.4} the lay follower named \textsanskrit{Dīghāvu}, who was advised in brief by the Buddha, has passed away. Where has he been reborn in his next life?” 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{5.6} the lay follower \textsanskrit{Dīghāvu} was astute. He practiced in line with the teachings, and did not trouble me about the teachings. With the ending of the five lower fetters, he’s been reborn spontaneously, and will become extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.”

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering. Now at that time the chamberlains Isidatta and \textsanskrit{Purāṇa} were residing in \textsanskrit{Sādhuka} on some business. They heard about this. 

So\marginnote{2.1} they posted someone on the road, saying: 

“My\marginnote{2.2} good man, let us know when you see the Blessed One coming, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.” And that person stood there for two or three days before they saw the Buddha coming off in the distance. When they saw him, they went to the chamberlains and said: 

“Sirs,\marginnote{2.5} the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha is coming. Please come at your convenience.” 

Then\marginnote{3.1} the chamberlains went up to the Buddha, bowed, and followed behind him. And then the Buddha left the road, went to the root of a certain tree, and sat down on the seat spread out. The chamberlains Isidatta and \textsanskrit{Purāṇa} bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha: 

“Sir,\marginnote{4.1} when we hear that you will be setting out from \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} to wander in the Kosalan lands, we’re sad and upset, thinking that you will be far from us. And when we hear that you are setting out from \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} to wander in the Kosalan lands, we’re sad and upset, thinking that you are far from us.

“Well\marginnote{14.1} then, chamberlains, living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. Just this much is enough to be diligent.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{14.3} for us there is something that’s even more cramped than that, and is considered as such.” 

“What\marginnote{14.4} is that?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{15.1} it’s when King Pasenadi of Kosala wants to go and visit a park. We have to harness and prepare his royal elephants. Then we have to seat his dear and beloved wives on the elephants, one in front of us, and one behind. Those sisters smell like a freshly opened perfume box; that’s how the royal ladies smell with makeup on. The touch of those sisters is like a tuft of cotton-wool or kapok; that’s how dainty the royal ladies are. Now at that time we must look after the elephants, the sisters, and ourselves. But we don’t recall having a bad thought regarding those sisters. This is that thing that’s even more cramped than that, and is considered as such.” 

“Well\marginnote{16.1} then, chamberlains, living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. Just this much is enough to be diligent. A noble disciple who has four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Bamboo Gate. The brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate heard: 

“It\marginnote{1.4} seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Bamboo Gate, together with a large \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of mendicants. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, \textsanskrit{Māras} and \textsanskrit{Brahmās}, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.” 

Then\marginnote{2.1} the brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Seated to one side they said to the Buddha: 

“Master\marginnote{2.2} Gotama, these are our wishes, desires, and hopes. We wish to live at home with our children; to use sandalwood imported from \textsanskrit{Kāsi}; to wear garlands, perfumes, and makeup; and to accept gold and money. And when our body breaks up, after death, we wish to be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. Given that we have such wishes, may the Buddha teach us the Dhamma so that we may achieve them.” 

“Householders,\marginnote{3.1} I will teach you an explanation of the Dhamma that applies to oneself. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{3.3} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“And\marginnote{4.1} what is the explanation of the Dhamma that applies to oneself? 

It’s\marginnote{4.2} when a noble disciple reflects: ‘I want to live and don’t want to die; I want to be happy and recoil from pain. Since this is so, if someone were to take my life, I wouldn’t like that. But others also want to live and don’t want to die; they want to be happy and recoil from pain. So if I were to take the life of someone else, they wouldn’t like that either. The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others. Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on someone else?’ Reflecting in this way, they give up killing living creatures themselves. And they encourage others to give up killing living creatures, praising the giving up of killing living creatures. So their bodily behavior is purified in three points. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{5.1} a noble disciple reflects: ‘If someone were to steal from me, I wouldn’t like that. But if I were to steal from someone else, they wouldn’t like that either. The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others. Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on someone else?’ Reflecting in this way, they give up stealing themselves. And they encourage others to give up stealing, praising the giving up of stealing. So their bodily behavior is purified in three points. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{6.1} a noble disciple reflects: ‘If someone were to have sexual relations with my wives, I wouldn’t like it. But if I were to have sexual relations with someone else’s wives, he wouldn’t like that either. The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by others. Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on others?’ Reflecting in this way, they give up sexual misconduct themselves. And they encourage others to give up sexual misconduct, praising the giving up of sexual misconduct. So their bodily behavior is purified in three points. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{7.1} a noble disciple reflects: ‘If someone were to distort my meaning by lying, I wouldn’t like it. But if I were to distort someone else’s meaning by lying, they wouldn’t like it either. The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by someone else. Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on others?’ Reflecting in this way, they give up lying themselves. And they encourage others to give up lying, praising the giving up of lying. So their verbal behavior is purified in three points. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{8.1} a noble disciple reflects: ‘If someone were to break me up from my friends by divisive speech, I wouldn’t like it. But if I were to break someone else from their friends by divisive speech, they wouldn’t like it either. …’ So their verbal behavior is purified in three points. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{9.1} a noble disciple reflects: ‘If someone were to attack me with harsh speech, I wouldn’t like it. But if I were to attack someone else with harsh speech, they wouldn’t like it either. …’ So their verbal behavior is purified in three points. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{10.1} a noble disciple reflects: ‘If someone were to annoy me by talking silliness and nonsense, I wouldn’t like it. But if I were to annoy someone else by talking silliness and nonsense, they wouldn’t like it either.’ The thing that is disliked by me is also disliked by another. Since I dislike this thing, how can I inflict it on another?’ Reflecting in this way, they give up talking nonsense themselves. And they encourage others to give up talking nonsense, praising the giving up of talking nonsense. So their verbal behavior is purified in three points. 

And\marginnote{11.1} they have experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} … And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion. When a noble disciple has these seven good qualities and these four desirable states they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’” 

When\marginnote{12.1} he had spoken, the brahmins and householders of Bamboo Gate said to the Buddha, “Excellent, Master Gotama! … We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.”

“Ānanda,\marginnote{3.1} the monk \textsanskrit{Sāḷha} passed away having realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements. 

The\marginnote{3.2} nun \textsanskrit{Nandā} passed away having ended the five lower fetters. She’s been reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. 

The\marginnote{3.3} layman Sudatta passed away having ended three fetters, and weakened greed, hate, and delusion. He’s a once-returner; he will come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. 

The\marginnote{3.4} laywoman \textsanskrit{Sujātā} passed away having ended three fetters. She’s a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. 

It’s\marginnote{4.1} hardly surprising that a human being should pass away. But if you should come and ask me about it each and every time someone dies that would be a bother for me. So Ānanda, I will teach you the explanation of the Dhamma called ‘the mirror of the teaching’. A noble disciple who has this may declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’ 

And\marginnote{5.1} what is that mirror of the teaching? 

It’s\marginnote{6.1} when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} … And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion. This is that mirror of the teaching. A noble disciple who has this may declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’”

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. “Mendicants, the brahmins advocate a practice called ‘get up and go’. They encourage their disciples: ‘Please, good people, rising early you should face east and walk. Do not avoid a pit, a cliff, a stump, thorny ground, a swamp, or a sewer. You should await death in the place that you fall. And when your body breaks up, after death, you’ll be reborn in a good place, a heaven realm.’ 

But\marginnote{2.1} this practice of the brahmins is a foolish procedure, a stupid procedure. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, or extinguishment. But in the training of the Noble One I advocate a ‘get up and go’ practice which does lead solely to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment.

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the venerables Ānanda and \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} were staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. Then in the late afternoon, Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} came out of retreat, went to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him: 

“Reverend,\marginnote{1.4} how many things do people have to give up and how many do they have to possess in order for the Buddha to declare that they’re a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening?” 

“Reverend,\marginnote{1.5} people have to give up four things and possess four things in order for the Buddha to declare that they’re a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. 

What\marginnote{2.1} four? They don’t have the distrust in the Buddha that causes an unlearned ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. And they do have the experiential confidence in the Buddha that causes a learned noble disciple to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a good place, a heavenly realm. ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 

They\marginnote{3.1} don’t have the distrust in the teaching that causes an unlearned ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. And they do have the experiential confidence in the teaching that causes a learned noble disciple to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a good place, a heavenly realm. ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ 

They\marginnote{4.1} don’t have the distrust in the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} that causes an unlearned ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. And they do have the experiential confidence in the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} that causes a learned noble disciple to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a good place, a heavenly realm. ‘The \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of the Buddha’s disciples is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, and worthy of veneration with joined palms.’ 

They\marginnote{5.1} don’t have the unethical conduct that causes an unlearned ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. And they do have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones that causes a learned noble disciple to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a good place, a heavenly realm. Their ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. People have to give up these four things and possess these four things in order for the Buddha to declare that they’re a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening.”

At\marginnote{1.1} Kapilavatthu. Then \textsanskrit{Mahānāma} the Sakyan went up to \textsanskrit{Godhā} the Sakyan, and said to him, “\textsanskrit{Godhā}, how many things must a person have for you to recognize them as a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening?” 

“\textsanskrit{Mahānāma},\marginnote{2.1} a person must have three things for me to recognize them as a stream-enterer. What three? It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … and the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} … When a person has these three things I recognize them as a stream-enterer. 

But\marginnote{3.1} \textsanskrit{Mahānāma}, how many things must a person have for \emph{you} to recognize them as a stream-enterer?” 

“\textsanskrit{Godhā},\marginnote{3.2} a person must have four things for me to recognize them as a stream-enterer. What four? It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} … And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion. When a person has these four things I recognize them as a stream-enterer.” 

“Hold\marginnote{4.1} on, \textsanskrit{Mahānāma}, hold on! Only the Buddha would know whether or not they have these things.” 

“Come,\marginnote{4.3} \textsanskrit{Godhā}, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this.” 

Then\marginnote{4.4} \textsanskrit{Mahānāma} and \textsanskrit{Godhā} went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. \textsanskrit{Mahānāma} told the Buddha all that had happened, and then said: 

“Sir,\marginnote{8.1} some issue regarding the teaching might come up. The Buddha might take one side, and the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of monks the other. I’d side with the Buddha. May the Buddha remember me as having such confidence. Some issue regarding the teaching might come up. The Buddha might take one side, and the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of monks and the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of nuns the other. … The Buddha might take one side, and the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of monks and the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of nuns and the laymen the other. … The Buddha might take one side, and the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of monks and the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of nuns and the laymen and the laywomen the other. … The Buddha might take one side, and the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of monks and the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of nuns and the laymen and the laywomen and the world—with its gods, \textsanskrit{Māras} and \textsanskrit{Brahmās}, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—the other. I’d side with the Buddha. May the Buddha remember me as having such confidence.” 

“\textsanskrit{Godhā},\marginnote{8.19} what do you have to say to \textsanskrit{Mahānāma} when he speaks like this?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{8.20} I have nothing to say to \textsanskrit{Mahānāma} when he speaks like this, except what is good and wholesome.”

At\marginnote{1.1} Kapilavatthu. 

Now\marginnote{1.2} at that time \textsanskrit{Sarakāni} the Sakyan had passed away. The Buddha declared that he was a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. 

At\marginnote{1.5} that, several Sakyans came together complaining, grumbling, and objecting, “It’s incredible, it’s amazing! Who can’t become a stream-enterer these days? For the Buddha even declared \textsanskrit{Sarakāni} to be a stream-enterer after he passed away. \textsanskrit{Sarakāni} was too weak for the training; he used to drink alcohol.” 

Then\marginnote{2.1} \textsanskrit{Mahānāma} the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said: 

“\textsanskrit{Mahānāma},\marginnote{3.1} when a lay follower has for a long time gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}, how could they go to the underworld? And if anyone should rightly be said to have for a long time gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}, it’s \textsanskrit{Sarakāni} the Sakyan. \textsanskrit{Sarakāni} the Sakyan has for a long time gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}.

Take\marginnote{4.1} a certain person who has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} … They have laughing wisdom and swift wisdom, and are endowed with freedom. They’ve realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. This person is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld. 

Take\marginnote{5.1} another person who has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} … They have laughing wisdom and swift wisdom, but are not endowed with freedom. With the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. This person, too, is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld. 

Take\marginnote{6.1} another person who has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} … But they don’t have laughing wisdom or swift wisdom, nor are they endowed with freedom. With the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, they’re a once-returner. They come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering. This person, too, is exempt from hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They’re exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld. 

Take\marginnote{7.1} another person who has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} … But they don’t have laughing wisdom or swift wisdom, nor are they endowed with freedom.

Take\marginnote{8.1} another person who doesn’t have experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} … They don’t have laughing wisdom or swift wisdom, nor are they endowed with freedom. Still, they have these qualities: the faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom. And they accept the principles proclaimed by the Realized One after considering them with a degree of wisdom. This person, too, doesn’t go to hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They don’t go to places of loss, bad places, the underworld.

This person, too, doesn’t go to hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. They don’t go to places of loss, bad places, the underworld. 

If\marginnote{9.9} these great sal trees could understand what was well said and poorly said, I’d declare them to be stream-enterers. Why can’t this apply to \textsanskrit{Sarakāni}? \textsanskrit{Mahānāma}, \textsanskrit{Sarakāni} the Sakyan undertook the training at the time of his death.”

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

Now\marginnote{1.2} at that time the householder \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika} was sick, suffering, gravely ill. Then he addressed a man, “Please, mister, go to Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him: ‘Sir, the householder \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika} is sick, suffering, gravely ill. He bows with his head to your feet.’ And then say: ‘Sir, please visit him at his home out of compassion.’” 

“Yes,\marginnote{2.1} sir,” that man replied. He did as \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika} asked. \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} consented in silence. 

Then\marginnote{4.1} Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went with Venerable Ānanda as his second monk to \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s home. He sat down on the seat spread out, and said to \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}, “I hope you’re keeping well, householder; I hope you’re alright. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{4.3} I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.” 

“Householder,\marginnote{5.1} you don’t have the distrust in the Buddha that causes an unlearned ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. And you have experiential confidence in the Buddha: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ Seeing in yourself that experiential confidence in the teaching, that pain may die down on the spot. 

You\marginnote{6.1} don’t have the distrust in the teaching that causes an unlearned ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. And you have experiential confidence in the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ Seeing in yourself that experiential confidence in the teaching, that pain may die down on the spot. 

You\marginnote{7.1} don’t have the distrust in the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} that causes an unlearned ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. And you have experiential confidence in the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}: ‘The \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of the Buddha’s disciples is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, and worthy of veneration with joined palms. It is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ Seeing in yourself that experiential confidence in the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}, that pain may die down on the spot. 

You\marginnote{8.1} don’t have the unethical conduct that causes an unlearned ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. Your ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. Seeing in yourself that ethical conduct loved by the noble ones, that pain may die down on the spot. 

You\marginnote{9.1} don’t have the wrong view that causes an unlearned ordinary person to be reborn—when their body breaks up, after death—in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. You have right view. Seeing in yourself that right view, that pain may die down on the spot. 

You\marginnote{10.1} don’t have the wrong thought … 

wrong\marginnote{11.1} speech … 

wrong\marginnote{12.1} action … 

wrong\marginnote{13.1} livelihood …

wrong\marginnote{18.1} freedom … You have right freedom. Seeing in yourself that right freedom, that pain may die down on the spot.” 

And\marginnote{19.1} then \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s pain died down on the spot. Then he served \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} and Ānanda from his own dish. When \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika} took a low seat and sat to one side. Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} expressed his appreciation to him with these verses. 

\begin{verse}%
“Whoever\marginnote{20.1} has faith in the Realized One, \\
unwavering and well grounded; \\
whose ethical conduct is good, \\
praised and loved by the noble ones; 

who\marginnote{21.1} has confidence in the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}, \\
and correct view: \\
they’re said to be prosperous, \\
their life is not in vain. 

So\marginnote{22.1} let the wise devote themselves \\
to faith, ethical behaviour, \\
confidence, and insight into the teaching, \\
remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.” 

%
\end{verse}

After\marginnote{23.1} expressing his appreciation to \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika} with these verses, \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} got up from his seat and left. 

Then\marginnote{24.1} Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, “So, Ānanda, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{24.3} Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} advised the householder \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika} in this way and that.” 

“\textsanskrit{Sāriputta}\marginnote{24.4} is astute, Ānanda. He has great wisdom, since he can analyze the four factors of stream-entry in ten respects.”

“Householder,\marginnote{4.1} when an unlearned ordinary person has four things, they’re frightened and terrified, and fear what awaits them after death. What four?

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

Seated\marginnote{1.2} to one side, the Buddha said to the householder \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}: 

“Householder,\marginnote{1.3} when a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble cycle with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’ 

What\marginnote{2.1} are the five dangers and threats they have quelled? Anyone who kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from killing living creatures. Anyone who steals … Anyone who commits sexual misconduct … Anyone who lies … Anyone who uses alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. These are the five dangers and threats they have quelled. 

What\marginnote{3.1} are the four factors of stream-entry that they have? It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} … And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion. These are the four factors of stream-entry that they have. 

And\marginnote{4.1} what is the noble cycle that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom? A noble disciple properly attends to dependent origination itself: ‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises. When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases.' That is: Ignorance is a condition for choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are a condition for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases. This is the noble cycle that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom. 

When\marginnote{5.1} a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble cycle with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’”

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. … “Mendicants, when a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble cycle with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Vesālī}, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then Nandaka the Licchavi minister went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 

“Nandaka,\marginnote{2.1} a noble disciple who has four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. What four? It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} … And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion. A noble disciple who has these four things is a stream-enterer, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening. 

A\marginnote{3.1} noble disciple who has these four things is guaranteed long life, beauty, happiness, fame, and sovereignty, both human and divine. Now, I don’t say this because I’ve heard it from some other ascetic or brahmin. I only say it because I’ve known, seen, and realized it for myself.” 

When\marginnote{4.1} he had spoken, a certain person said to Nandaka: 

“Sir,\marginnote{4.2} it is time to bathe.” 

“Enough\marginnote{4.3} now, my man, with that exterior bath. This interior bathing will do for me, that is, confidence in the Buddha.”

“Yes,\marginnote{2.4} sir,” Nandiya replied. The Buddha said this: 

“And\marginnote{3.1} how does a noble disciple live negligently? Firstly, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha … They’re content with that confidence, and don’t make a further effort for solitude by day or retreat by night. When they live negligently, there’s no joy. When there’s no joy, there’s no rapture. When there’s no rapture, there’s no tranquility. When there’s no tranquility, there’s suffering. When one is suffering, the mind does not become immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi}. When the mind is not immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi}, principles do not become clear. Because principles have not become clear, they’re reckoned to live negligently. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{4.1} a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the teaching … the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} … And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion. They’re content with that ethical conduct loved by the noble ones, and don’t make a further effort for solitude by day or retreat by night. When they live negligently, there’s no joy.

Because principles have not become clear, they’re reckoned to live negligently. That’s how a noble disciple lives negligently. 

And\marginnote{5.1} how does a noble disciple live diligently? Firstly, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha … But they’re not content with that confidence, and make a further effort for solitude by day and retreat by night. When they live diligently, joy springs up. Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi}. When the mind is immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi}, principles become clear. Because principles have become clear, they’re reckoned to live diligently. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{6.1} a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the teaching … the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} … And they have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. Now at that time a certain mendicant who had completed the rainy season residence in \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} arrived at Kapilavatthu on some business. The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu heard about this. 

They\marginnote{2.1} went to that mendicant, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, we hope that you’re healthy and well.” 

“I\marginnote{2.3} am, good sirs.” 

“And\marginnote{3.1} we hope that \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} and \textsanskrit{Moggallāna} are healthy and well.” 

“They\marginnote{3.2} are.” 

“And\marginnote{4.1} we hope that the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} is healthy and well.” 

“It\marginnote{4.2} is.” 

“But\marginnote{5.1} sir, during this rains residence did you hear and learn anything in the presence of the Buddha?” 

“Good\marginnote{5.2} sirs, I heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha: ‘There are fewer mendicants who realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. There are more mendicants who, having ended the five lower fetters, are reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world.’ 

In\marginnote{6.1} addition, I heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha: ‘There are fewer mendicants who, having ended the five lower fetters, are reborn spontaneously, and will be extinguished there, not liable to return from that world. There are more mendicants who, with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, are once-returners, who come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.’ 

In\marginnote{7.1} addition, I heard and learned this in the presence of the Buddha: ‘There are fewer mendicants who, with the ending of three fetters, and the weakening of greed, hate, and delusion, are once-returners, who come back to this world once only, then make an end of suffering.

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana. Then the lay follower Dhammadinna, together with five hundred lay followers, went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 

“May\marginnote{1.3} the Buddha please advise and instruct us. It will be for our lasting welfare and happiness.” 

“So,\marginnote{2.1} Dhammadinna, you should train like this: ‘From time to time we will undertake and dwell upon the discourses spoken by the Realized One that are deep, profound, transcendent, dealing with emptiness.’ That’s how you should train yourselves.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.4} we live at home with our children, using sandalwood imported from \textsanskrit{Kāsi}, wearing garlands, perfumes, and makeup, and accepting gold and money. It’s not easy for us to undertake and dwell from time to time upon the discourses spoken by the Realized One that are deep, profound, transcendent, dealing with emptiness. Since we are established in the five training rules, please teach us further.” 

“So,\marginnote{3.1} Dhammadinna, you should train like this: ‘We will have experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} … And we will have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.’ That’s how you should train yourselves.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{4.1} these four factors of stream-entry that were taught by the Buddha are found in us, and we embody them. For we have experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} … And we have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. 

At\marginnote{1.2} that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering. 

\textsanskrit{Mahānāma}\marginnote{1.4} the Sakyan heard about this. Then he went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him that he had heard that the Buddha was leaving. He added, “Sir, I haven’t heard and learned it in the presence of the Buddha how a wise lay follower should advise another wise lay follower who is sick, suffering, gravely ill.” 

“\textsanskrit{Mahānāma},\marginnote{2.1} a wise lay follower should put at ease another wise lay follower who is sick, suffering, gravely ill with four consolations. ‘Be at ease, sir. You have experiential confidence in the Buddha … the teaching … the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} … And you have the ethical conduct loved by the noble ones … leading to immersion.’ 

When\marginnote{3.1} a wise lay follower has put at ease another wise lay follower who is sick, suffering, gravely ill with these four consolations, they should say: ‘Are you concerned for your mother and father?’ If they reply, ‘I am,’ they should say: ‘But sir, it’s your nature to die. Whether or not you are concerned for your mother and father, you will die anyway. It would be good to give up concern for your mother and father.’ 

If\marginnote{4.1} they reply, ‘I have given up concern for my mother and father,’ they should say: ‘But are you concerned for your partners and children?’ If they reply, ‘I am,’ they should say: ‘But sir, it’s your nature to die. Whether or not you are concerned for your partners and children, you will die anyway. It would be good to give up concern for your partners and children.’ 

If\marginnote{5.1} they reply, ‘I have given up concern for my partners and children,’ they should say: ‘But are you concerned for the five kinds of human sensual stimulation?’ If they reply, ‘I am,’ they should say: ‘Good sir, heavenly sensual pleasures are better than human sensual pleasures. It would be good to turn your mind away from human sensual pleasures and fix it on the gods of the Four Great Kings.’ 

If\marginnote{6.1} they reply, ‘I have done so,’ they should say: ‘Good sir, the gods of the Thirty-Three are better than the gods of the Four Great Kings … 

Good\marginnote{7.1} sir, the gods of Yama … the Joyful Gods … the Gods Who Love to Create … the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others … the Gods of the \textsanskrit{Brahmā} realm are better than the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others. It would be good to turn your mind away from the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others and fix it on the Gods of the \textsanskrit{Brahmā} realm.’ If they reply, ‘I have done so,’ they should say: ‘Good sir, the \textsanskrit{Brahmā} realm is impermanent, not lasting, and included within identity. It would be good to turn your mind away from the \textsanskrit{Brahmā} realm and apply it to the cessation of identity.’ 

If\marginnote{8.1} they reply, ‘I have done so,’ then there is no difference between a lay follower whose mind is freed in this way and a mendicant whose mind is freed from defilements; that is, between the freedom of one and the other.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana. There the Buddha addressed the group of five mendicants: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.1} these two extremes should not be cultivated by one who has gone forth. What two? Indulgence in sensual pleasures, which is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And indulgence in self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless. Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One woke up by understanding the middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment. 

And\marginnote{3.1} what is that middle way of practice? It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. This is that middle way of practice, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment. 

Now\marginnote{4.1} this is the noble truth of suffering. Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; illness is suffering; death is suffering; association with the disliked is suffering; separation from the liked is suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering. 

Now\marginnote{4.3} this is the noble truth of the origin of suffering. It’s the craving that leads to future lives, mixed up with relishing and greed, chasing pleasure in various realms. That is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving to continue existence, and craving to end existence. 

Now\marginnote{4.6} this is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering. It’s the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over; giving it away, letting it go, releasing it, and not adhering to it. 

Now\marginnote{4.8} this is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 

‘This\marginnote{5.1} is the noble truth of suffering.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another. ‘This noble truth of suffering should be completely understood.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … ‘This noble truth of suffering has been completely understood.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … 

‘This\marginnote{6.1} is the noble truth of the origin of suffering.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … ‘This noble truth of the origin of suffering should be given up.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … ‘This noble truth of the origin of suffering has been given up.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … 

‘This\marginnote{7.1} is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … ‘This noble truth of the cessation of suffering should be realized.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … ‘This noble truth of the cessation of suffering has been realized.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … 

‘This\marginnote{8.1} is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … ‘This noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering should be developed.’ Such was the vision that arose in me … ‘This noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering has been developed.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another. 

As\marginnote{9.1} long as my true knowledge and vision about these four noble truths was not fully purified in these three perspectives and twelve aspects, I didn’t announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, \textsanskrit{Māras}, and \textsanskrit{Brahmās}, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. 

But\marginnote{10.1} when my true knowledge and vision about these four noble truths was fully purified in these three perspectives and twelve aspects, I announced my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, \textsanskrit{Māras}, and \textsanskrit{Brahmās}, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. 

Knowledge\marginnote{10.2} and vision arose in me: ‘My freedom is unshakable; this is my last rebirth; now there’ll be no more future lives.’” 

That\marginnote{10.4} is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the group of five mendicants was happy with what the Buddha said. 

And\marginnote{11.1} while this discourse was being spoken, the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in Venerable \textsanskrit{Koṇḍañña}: “Everything that has a beginning has an end.” 

And\marginnote{12.1} when the Buddha rolled forth the Wheel of Dhamma, the earth gods raised the cry: “Near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or \textsanskrit{Māra} or \textsanskrit{Brahmā} or by anyone in the world.” 

Hearing\marginnote{12.3} the cry of the Earth Gods, the Gods of the Four Great Kings … the Gods of the Thirty-Three … the Gods of Yama … the Joyful Gods … the Gods Who Love to Create … the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others … the Gods of \textsanskrit{Brahmā}’s Host raised the cry: “Near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana, the Buddha has rolled forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or \textsanskrit{Māra} or \textsanskrit{Brahmā} or by anyone in the world.” 

And\marginnote{13.1} so at that moment, in that instant, the cry soared up to the \textsanskrit{Brahmā} realm. And this galaxy shook and rocked and trembled. And an immeasurable, magnificent light appeared in the world, surpassing the glory of the gods. 

Then\marginnote{14.1} the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: “\textsanskrit{Koṇḍañña} has really understood! \textsanskrit{Koṇḍañña} has really understood!” 

And\marginnote{14.3} that’s how Venerable \textsanskrit{Koṇḍañña} came to be known as “\textsanskrit{Koṇḍañña} Who Understood”.

That\marginnote{3.1} is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 

\begin{verse}%
“There\marginnote{4.1} are those who don’t understand suffering \\
and suffering’s cause, \\
and where all suffering \\
ceases with nothing left over. 

And\marginnote{5.1} they don’t know the path \\
that leads to the stilling of suffering. \\
They lack the heart’s release, \\
as well as the release by wisdom. \\
Unable to make an end, \\
they continue to be reborn and grow old. 

But\marginnote{6.1} there are those who understand suffering \\
and suffering’s cause, \\
and where all suffering \\
ceases with nothing left over. 

And\marginnote{7.1} they understand the path \\
that leads to the stilling of suffering. \\
They’re endowed with the heart’s release, \\
as well as the release by wisdom. \\
Able to make an end, \\
they don’t continue to be reborn and grow old.”

“Reverends,\marginnote{1.3} does someone who sees suffering also see the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering?” 

When\marginnote{2.1} they said this, Venerable Gavampati said to those senior mendicants:

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: 

“Once\marginnote{1.3} upon a time, mendicants, a certain person left \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, thinking ‘I’ll speculate about the world.’ They went to the \textsanskrit{Sumāgadhā} lotus pond and sat down on the bank speculating about the world. Then that person saw an army of four divisions enter a lotus stalk. When he saw this he thought, ‘I’ve gone mad, really, I’ve lost my mind! I’m seeing things that don’t exist in the world.’ 

Then\marginnote{2.1} that person entered the city and informed a large crowd, ‘I’ve gone mad, really, I’ve lost my mind! I’m seeing things that don’t exist in the world.’ 

‘But\marginnote{2.4} how is it that you’re mad? How have you lost your mind? And what have you seen that doesn’t exist in the world?’ 

‘Sirs,\marginnote{2.6} I left \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, thinking “I’ll speculate about the world.” I went to the \textsanskrit{Sumāgadhā} lotus pond and sat down on the bank speculating about the world. Then I saw an army of four divisions enter a lotus stalk. That’s why I’m mad, that’s why I’ve lost my mind. And that’s what I’ve seen that doesn’t exist in the world.’ 

‘Well,\marginnote{2.10} mister, you’re definitely mad, you’ve definitely lost your mind. And you’re seeing things that don’t exist in the world.’ 

But\marginnote{3.1} what that person saw was in fact real, not unreal. Once upon a time, a battle was fought between the gods and the demons. In that battle the gods won and the demons lost. The defeated and terrified demons entered the citadel of the demons through the lotus stalk only to confuse the gods. 

So\marginnote{4.1} mendicants, don’t speculate about the world. For example: the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist. Why is that? Because those thoughts aren’t beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. They don’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. 

When\marginnote{5.1} you think something up, you should think: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Vesālī}, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. 

Then\marginnote{1.2} Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered \textsanskrit{Vesālī} for alms. He saw several Licchavi youths practicing archery near the town hall. They were shooting arrows from a distance through a small keyhole, shot after shot without missing. 

When\marginnote{1.4} he saw this he thought, “These Licchavi youths really are trained, so well trained, in that they shoot arrows from a distance through a small keyhole, shot after shot without missing.” 

Then\marginnote{2.1} Ānanda wandered for alms in \textsanskrit{Vesālī}. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. 

“What\marginnote{3.1} do you think, Ānanda? Which is harder and more challenging: to shoot arrows from a distance through a small keyhole, shot after shot without missing? Or to take a horsehair split into seven strands and penetrate one tip with another tip?” 

“It’s\marginnote{3.4} more difficult and challenging, sir, to take a horsehair split into seven strands and penetrate one tip with another tip.”

“…\marginnote{1.1} the sentient beings who die as ghosts and are reborn as gods are few, while those who die as ghosts and are reborn in the ghost realm are many. Why is that? It’s because they haven’t seen the four noble truths. What four? The noble truths of suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. 

That’s\marginnote{2.1} why you should practice meditation to understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’.” 

That\marginnote{3.1} is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.

\section*{The Translator}

Bhikkhu Sujato was born as Anthony Aidan Best on 4/11/1966 in Perth, Western Australia. He grew up in the pleasant suburbs of Mt Lawley and Attadale alongside his sister Nicola, who was the good child. His mother, Margaret Lorraine Huntsman née Pinder, said “he’ll either be a priest or a poet”, while his father, Anthony Thomas Best, advised him to “never do anything for money”. He attended Aquinas College, a Catholic school, where he decided to become an atheist. At the University of WA he studied philosophy, aiming to learn what he wanted to do with his life. Finding that what he wanted to do was play guitar, he dropped out. His main band was named Martha’s Vineyard, which achieved modest success in the indie circuit. 

A seemingly random encounter with a roadside joey took him to Thailand, where he entered his first meditation retreat at Wat Ram Poeng, Chieng Mai in 1992. Feeling the call to the Buddha’s path, he took full ordination in Wat Pa Nanachat in 1994, where his teachers were Ajahn Pasanno and Ajahn Jayasaro. In 1997 he returned to Perth to study with Ajahn Brahm at Bodhinyana Monastery. 

He spent several years practicing in seclusion in Malaysia and Thailand before establishing Santi Forest Monastery in Bundanoon, NSW, in 2003. There he was instrumental in supporting the establishment of the Theravada bhikkhuni order in Australia and advocating for women’s rights. He continues to teach in Australia and globally, with a special concern for the moral implications of climate change and other forms of environmental destruction. He has published a series of books of original and groundbreaking research on early Buddhism. 

In 2005 he founded SuttaCentral together with Rod Bucknell and John Kelly. In 2015, seeing the need for a complete, accurate, plain English translation of the Pali texts, he undertook the task, spending nearly three years in isolation on the isle of Qi Mei off the coast of the nation of Taiwan. He completed the four main \textsanskrit{Nikāyas} in 2018, and the early books of the Khuddaka \textsanskrit{Nikāya} were complete by 2021. All this work is dedicated to the public domain and is entirely free of copyright encumbrance. 

In 2019 he returned to Sydney where he established Lokanta Vihara (The Monastery at the End of the World). 

\section*{Creation Process}

Primary source was the digital \textsanskrit{Mahāsaṅgīti} edition of the Pali \textsanskrit{Tipiṭaka}. Translated from the Pali, with reference to several English translations, especially those of Bhikkhu Bodhi.

\section*{The Translation}

This translation was part of a project to translate the four Pali \textsanskrit{Nikāyas} with the following aims: plain, approachable English; consistent terminology; accurate rendition of the Pali; free of copyright. It was made during 2016–2018 while Bhikkhu Sujato was staying in Qimei, Taiwan.

\section*{About SuttaCentral}

SuttaCentral publishes early Buddhist texts. Since 2005 we have provided root texts in Pali, Chinese, Sanskrit, Tibetan, and other languages, parallels between these texts, and translations in many modern languages. We build on the work of generations of scholars, and offer our contribution freely.

SuttaCentral is driven by volunteer contributions, and in addition we employ professional developers. We offer a sponsorship program for high quality translations from the original languages. Financial support for SuttaCentral is handled by the SuttaCentral Development Trust, a charitable trust registered in Australia.

\section*{About Bilara}

“Bilara” means “cat” in Pali, and it is the name of our Computer Assisted Translation (CAT) software. Bilara is a web app that enables translators to translate early Buddhist texts into their own language. These translations are published on SuttaCentral with the root text and translation side by side.

\section*{About SuttaCentral Editions}

The SuttaCentral Editions project makes high quality books from selected Bilara translations. These are published in formats including HTML, EPUB, PDF, and print.
