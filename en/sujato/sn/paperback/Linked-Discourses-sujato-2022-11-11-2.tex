\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” 

“Venerable\marginnote{1.5} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.7} I will teach you dependent origination. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.9} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“And\marginnote{2.1} what is dependent origination? Ignorance is a condition for choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. This is called dependent origination. 

When\marginnote{3.1} ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.” 

That\marginnote{3.13} is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} I will teach and analyze for you dependent origination. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.4} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“And\marginnote{2.1} what is dependent origination? Ignorance is a condition for choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. 

And\marginnote{3.1} what is old age and death? The old age, decrepitude, broken teeth, grey hair, wrinkly skin, diminished vitality, and failing faculties of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings. This is called old age. The passing away, perishing, disintegration, demise, mortality, death, decease, breaking up of the aggregates, and laying to rest of the corpse of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings. This is called death. Such is old age, and such is death. This is called old age and death. 

And\marginnote{4.1} what is rebirth? The rebirth, inception, conception, reincarnation, manifestation of the aggregates, and acquisition of the sense fields of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings. This is called rebirth. 

And\marginnote{5.1} what is continued existence? There are these three states of existence. Existence in the sensual realm, the realm of luminous form, and the formless realm. This is called continued existence. 

And\marginnote{6.1} what is grasping? There are these four kinds of grasping. Grasping at sensual pleasures, views, precepts and observances, and theories of a self. This is called grasping. 

And\marginnote{7.1} what is craving? There are these six classes of craving. Craving for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts. This is called craving. 

And\marginnote{8.1} what is feeling? There are these six classes of feeling. Feeling born of contact through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. This is called feeling. 

And\marginnote{9.1} what is contact? There are these six classes of contact. Contact through the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. This is called contact. 

And\marginnote{10.1} what are the six sense fields? The sense fields of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. These are called the six sense fields. 

And\marginnote{11.1} what are name and form? Feeling, perception, intention, contact, and attention. This is called name. The four primary elements, and form derived from the four primary elements. This is called form. Such is name and such is form. These are called name and form. 

And\marginnote{12.1} what is consciousness? There are these six classes of consciousness. Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind consciousness. This is called consciousness. 

And\marginnote{13.1} what are choices? There are three kinds of choices. Choices by way of body, speech, and mind. These are called choices. 

And\marginnote{14.1} what is ignorance? Not knowing about suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. This is called ignorance. 

And\marginnote{15.1} so, ignorance is a condition for choices. 

Choices\marginnote{15.2} are a condition for consciousness. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.”

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} \textsanskrit{Vipassī} the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha had this thought before his awakening, when he was still unawakened but intent on awakening: ‘Alas, this world has fallen into trouble. It’s born, grows old, dies, passes away, and is reborn, yet it doesn’t understand how to escape from this suffering, from old age and death. Oh, when will an escape be found from this suffering, from old age and death?’ 

Then\marginnote{2.1} \textsanskrit{Vipassī}, the one intent on awakening, thought: ‘When what exists is there old age and death? What is a condition for old age and death?’ Then, through proper attention, \textsanskrit{Vipassī} comprehended with wisdom: ‘When rebirth exists there’s old age and death. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’ 

Then\marginnote{3.1} \textsanskrit{Vipassī} thought: ‘When what exists is there rebirth? What is a condition for rebirth?’ Then, through proper attention, \textsanskrit{Vipassī} comprehended with wisdom: ‘When continued existence exists there’s rebirth. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.’ 

Then\marginnote{4.1} \textsanskrit{Vipassī} thought: ‘When what exists is there continued existence? What is a condition for continued existence?’ Then, through proper attention, \textsanskrit{Vipassī} comprehended with wisdom: ‘When grasping exists there’s continued existence. Grasping is a condition for continued existence.’

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.1} before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought: ‘Alas, this world has fallen into trouble. It’s born, grows old, dies, passes away, and is reborn, yet it doesn’t understand how to escape from this suffering, from old age and death. Oh, when will an escape be found from this suffering, from old age and death?’ 

Then\marginnote{2.1} it occurred to me: ‘When what exists is there old age and death? What is a condition for old age and death?’ Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: ‘When rebirth exists there’s old age and death. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’ 

Then\marginnote{3.1} it occurred to me: ‘When what exists is there rebirth? … continued existence … grasping … craving … feeling … contact … the six sense fields … name and form … consciousness … ‘When what exists are there choices?

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.3} there are these four fuels. They maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born. What four?

When\marginnote{2.1} he said this, Venerable Phagguna of the Top-Knot said to the Buddha, “But sir, who consumes the fuel for consciousness?” 

“That’s\marginnote{2.3} not a fitting question,” said the Buddha. 

“I\marginnote{2.4} don’t speak of one who consumes. If I were to speak of one who consumes, then it would be fitting to ask who consumes. But I don’t speak like that. Hence it would be fitting to ask: ‘Consciousness is a fuel for what?’ And a fitting answer to this would be: ‘Consciousness is a fuel that conditions rebirth into a new state of existence in the future. When that which has been reborn is present, there are the six sense fields. The six sense fields are a condition for contact.’” 

“But\marginnote{3.1} sir, who contacts?” 

“That’s\marginnote{3.2} not a fitting question,” said the Buddha. 

“I\marginnote{3.3} don’t speak of one who contacts. If I were to speak of one who contacts, then it would be fitting to ask who contacts. But I don’t speak like that.

“I\marginnote{4.3} don’t speak of one who feels. If I were to speak of one who feels, then it would be fitting to ask who feels. But I don’t speak like that.

“But\marginnote{6.1} sir, who grasps?”

“I\marginnote{6.3} don’t speak of one who grasps. If I were to speak of one who grasps, then it would be fitting to ask who grasps. But I don’t speak like that.

“Sir,\marginnote{1.3} they speak of this thing called ‘right view’. How is right view defined?” 

“\textsanskrit{Kaccāna},\marginnote{2.1} this world mostly relies on the dual notions of existence and non-existence. 

But\marginnote{2.2} when you truly see the origin of the world with right understanding, you won’t have the notion of non-existence regarding the world. And when you truly see the cessation of the world with right understanding, you won’t have the notion of existence regarding the world.

But\marginnote{2.5} if—when it comes to this attraction, grasping, mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendency—you don’t get attracted, grasp, and commit to the notion ‘my self’, you’ll have no doubt or uncertainty that what arises is just suffering arising, and what ceases is just suffering ceasing.

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 

Then\marginnote{1.3} the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} for alms. The naked ascetic Kassapa saw the Buddha coming off in the distance. He went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. 

When\marginnote{1.6} the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side, and said to the Buddha, 

“I’d\marginnote{1.7} like to ask Master Gotama about a certain point, if you’d take the time to answer.” 

“Kassapa,\marginnote{1.8} it’s the wrong time for questions. We’ve entered an inhabited area.” 

A\marginnote{2.1} second time, and a third time, Kassapa spoke to the Buddha and the Buddha replied. When this was said, Kassapa said to the Buddha, 

“I\marginnote{2.8} don’t want to ask much.” 

“Ask\marginnote{2.9} what you wish, Kassapa.” 

“Well,\marginnote{3.1} Master Gotama, is suffering made by oneself?” 

“Not\marginnote{3.2} so, Kassapa,” said the Buddha. 

“Then\marginnote{3.3} is suffering made by another?” 

“Not\marginnote{3.4} so, Kassapa,” said the Buddha. 

“Well,\marginnote{3.5} is suffering made by both oneself and another?” 

“Not\marginnote{3.6} so, Kassapa,” said the Buddha. 

“Then\marginnote{3.7} does suffering arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?” 

“Not\marginnote{3.8} so, Kassapa,” said the Buddha. 

“Well,\marginnote{3.9} is there no such thing as suffering?” 

“It’s\marginnote{3.10} not that there’s no such thing as suffering. Suffering is real.” 

“Then\marginnote{3.12} Master Gotama doesn’t know nor see suffering.” 

“It’s\marginnote{3.13} not that I don’t know or see suffering. I do know suffering, I do see suffering.” 

“Master\marginnote{4.1} Gotama, when asked these questions, you say ‘not so’. Yet you say that there is such a thing as suffering. And you say that you do know suffering, and you do see suffering. Sir, explain suffering to me! Teach me about suffering!” 

“Suppose\marginnote{5.1} that the person who does the deed experiences the result. Then for one who has existed since the beginning, suffering is made by oneself. This statement leans toward eternalism. Suppose that one person does the deed and another experiences the result. Then for one stricken by feeling, suffering is made by another. This statement leans toward annihilationism. Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way: ‘Ignorance is a condition for choices. 

Choices\marginnote{5.5} are a condition for consciousness. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’” 

When\marginnote{6.1} this was said, Kassapa said to the Buddha, “Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, the Buddha has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}. Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” 

“Kassapa,\marginnote{7.1} if someone formerly ordained in another sect wishes to take the going forth, the ordination in this teaching and training, they must spend four months on probation. When four months have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, they’ll give the going forth, the ordination into monkhood. However, I have recognized individual differences.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{8.1} if four months probation are required in such a case, I’ll spend four years on probation. When four years have passed, if the mendicants are satisfied, let them give me the going forth, the ordination into monkhood.” 

And\marginnote{9.1} the naked ascetic Kassapa received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. Not long after his ordination, Venerable Kassapa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 

He\marginnote{9.3} understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable Kassapa became one of the perfected.

Then\marginnote{1.2} the wanderer Timbaruka went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: 

“Well,\marginnote{2.1} Master Gotama, are pleasure and pain made by oneself?” 

“Not\marginnote{2.2} so, Timbaruka,” said the Buddha. 

“Then\marginnote{2.3} are pleasure and pain made by another?” 

“Not\marginnote{2.4} so, Timbaruka,” said the Buddha. 

“Well,\marginnote{2.5} are pleasure and pain made by both oneself and another?” 

“Not\marginnote{2.6} so, Timbaruka,” said the Buddha. 

“Then\marginnote{2.7} do pleasure and pain arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?” 

“Not\marginnote{2.8} so, Timbaruka,” said the Buddha. 

“Well,\marginnote{2.9} is there no such thing as pleasure and pain?” 

“It’s\marginnote{2.10} not that there’s no such thing as pleasure and pain. Pleasure and pain are real.” 

“Then\marginnote{2.12} Master Gotama doesn’t know nor see pleasure and pain.” 

“It’s\marginnote{2.13} not that I don’t know or see pleasure and pain. I do know pleasure and pain, I do see pleasure and pain.” 

“Master\marginnote{3.1} Gotama, when asked these questions, you say ‘not so’. Yet you say that there is such a thing as pleasure and pain. And you say that you do know pleasure and pain, and you do see pleasure and pain. Sir, explain pleasure and pain to me! Teach me about pleasure and pain!” 

“Suppose\marginnote{4.1} that the feeling and the one who feels it are the same thing. Then for one who has existed since the beginning, pleasure and pain is made by oneself. I don’t say this. Suppose that the feeling is one thing and the one who feels it is another. Then for one stricken by feeling, pleasure and pain is made by another. I don’t say this. Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way: ‘Ignorance is a condition for choices. 

Choices\marginnote{4.5} are a condition for consciousness. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’” 

When\marginnote{5.1} he said this, the wanderer Timbaruka said to the Buddha, “Excellent, sir! Excellent! … I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} for a fool shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving, this body has been produced. So there is the duality of this body and external name and form. Contact depends on this duality. When contacted through one or other of the six sense fields, the fool experiences pleasure and pain. 

For\marginnote{2.1} an astute person shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving, this body has been produced. So there is the duality of this body and external name and form. Contact depends on this duality. When contacted through one or other of the six sense fields, the astute person experiences pleasure and pain. 

What,\marginnote{3.1} then, is the difference between the foolish and the astute?” 

“Our\marginnote{3.2} teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” 

“Well\marginnote{4.1} then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{4.2} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“For\marginnote{5.1} a fool shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving, this body has been produced. But the fool has not given up that ignorance or finished that craving. Why is that? The fool has not completed the spiritual journey for the complete ending of suffering. Therefore, when their body breaks up, the fool is reborn in another body. When reborn in another body, they’re not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They’re not freed from suffering, I say. 

For\marginnote{6.1} an astute person shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving, this body has been produced. But the astute person has given up that ignorance and finished that craving. Why is that? The astute person has completed the spiritual journey for the complete ending of suffering. Therefore, when their body breaks up, the astute person is not reborn in another body. Not being reborn in another body, they’re freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They’re freed from suffering, I say. This is the difference here between the foolish and the astute, that is, leading the spiritual life.”

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} I will teach you dependent origination and dependently originated phenomena. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.4} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“And\marginnote{2.1} what is dependent origination? Rebirth is a condition for old age and death. Whether Realized Ones arise or not, this law of nature persists, this regularity of natural principles, this invariance of natural principles, specific conditionality. A Realized One understands this and comprehends it, then he explains, teaches, asserts, establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals it. ‘Look,’ he says, ‘Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’ 

Continued\marginnote{3.1} existence is a condition for rebirth … Grasping is a condition for continued existence … Craving is a condition for grasping … 

Feeling\marginnote{3.4} is a condition for craving … Contact is a condition for feeling … The six sense fields are a condition for contact … Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields … 

Consciousness\marginnote{3.8} is a condition for name and form … 

Choices\marginnote{3.9} are a condition for consciousness … Ignorance is a condition for choices. Whether Realized Ones arise or not, this law of nature persists, this regularity of natural principles, this invariance of natural principles, specific conditionality. A Realized One understands this and comprehends it, then he explains, teaches, asserts, establishes, clarifies, analyzes, and reveals it. ‘Look,’ he says, ‘Ignorance is a condition for choices.’ So the fact that this is real, not unreal, not otherwise; the specific conditionality of it: this is called dependent origination. 

And\marginnote{4.1} what are the dependently originated phenomena? Old age and death are impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated, liable to end, vanish, fade away, and cease. Rebirth … Continued existence … Grasping … Craving … 

Feeling\marginnote{4.7} … Contact … The six sense fields … Name and form … 

Consciousness\marginnote{4.11} … 

Choices\marginnote{4.12} … Ignorance is impermanent, conditioned, dependently originated, liable to end, vanish, fade away, and cease. These are called the dependently originated phenomena. 

When\marginnote{5.1} a noble disciple has clearly seen with right wisdom this dependent origination and these dependently originated phenomena as they are, it’s impossible for them to turn back to the past, thinking: ‘Did I exist in the past? Did I not exist in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past? After being what, what did I become in the past?’ Or to turn forward to the future, thinking: ‘Will I exist in the future? Will I not exist in the future? What will I be in the future? How will I be in the future? After being what, what will I become in the future?’ Or to be undecided about the present, thinking: ‘Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? This sentient being—where did it come from? And where will it go?’ Why is that? Because that noble disciple has clearly seen with right wisdom this dependent origination and these dependently originated phenomena as they are.”

So\marginnote{2.1} the teaching has been well explained by me, made clear, opened, illuminated, and stripped of patchwork. Just this much is quite enough for a gentleman who has gone forth out of faith to rouse up his energy. ‘Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and tendons remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.’ 

A\marginnote{3.1} lazy person lives in suffering, mixed up with bad, unskillful qualities, and ruins a great deal of their own good. An energetic person lives happily, secluded from bad, unskillful qualities, and fulfills a great deal of their own good. 

The\marginnote{3.3} best isn’t reached by the worst. The best is reached by the best. This spiritual life is the cream, mendicants, and the Teacher is before you. 

So\marginnote{3.6} you should rouse up energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized, thinking: ‘In this way our going forth will not be wasted, but will be fruitful and fertile. And our use of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick shall be of great fruit and benefit for those who offered them.’ That’s how you should train. 

Considering\marginnote{3.10} what is good for yourself, mendicants, is quite enough for you to persist with diligence. Considering what is good for others is quite enough for you to persist with diligence. Considering what is good for both is quite enough for you to persist with diligence.”

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} I say that the ending of defilements is for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not know or see. For one who knows and sees what? ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling … Such is perception … Such are choices … Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ The ending of the defilements is for one who knows and sees this. 

I\marginnote{2.1} say that this knowledge of ending has a vital condition, it doesn’t lack a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Freedom.’ I say that freedom has a vital condition, it doesn’t lack a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Dispassion.’ I say that dispassion has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Disillusionment.’ I say that disillusionment has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Truly knowing and seeing.’ I say that truly knowing and seeing has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Immersion.’ I say that immersion has a vital condition. 

And\marginnote{3.1} what is it? You should say: ‘Bliss.’ I say that bliss has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Tranquility.’ I say that tranquility has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Rapture.’ I say that rapture has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Joy.’ I say that joy has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Faith.’ I say that faith has a vital condition. 

And\marginnote{4.1} what is it? You should say: ‘Suffering.’ I say that suffering has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Rebirth.’ I say that rebirth has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Continued existence.’ I say that continued existence has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Grasping.’ I say that grasping has a vital condition. And what is it? You should say: ‘Craving.’ I say that craving has a vital condition. 

And\marginnote{5.1} what is it? You should say: ‘Feeling.’ … You should say: ‘Contact.’ … You should say: ‘The six sense fields.’ … You should say: ‘Name and form.’ … You should say: ‘Consciousness.’ … You should say: ‘Choices.’ … I say that choices have a vital condition, they don’t lack a vital condition. And what is the vital condition for choices? You should say: ‘Ignorance.’ 

So\marginnote{6.1} ignorance is a vital condition for choices. Choices are a vital condition for consciousness. Consciousness is a vital condition for name and form. Name and form are vital conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are vital conditions for contact. Contact is a vital condition for feeling. Feeling is a vital condition for craving. Craving is a vital condition for grasping. Grasping is a vital condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a vital condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a vital condition for suffering. Suffering is a vital condition for faith. Faith is a vital condition for joy. Joy is a vital condition for rapture. Rapture is a vital condition for tranquility. Tranquility is a vital condition for bliss. Bliss is a vital condition for immersion. Immersion is a vital condition for truly knowing and seeing. Truly knowing and seeing is a vital condition for disillusionment. Disillusionment is a vital condition for dispassion. Dispassion is a vital condition for freedom. Freedom is a vital condition for the knowledge of ending. 

It’s\marginnote{7.1} like when it rains heavily on a mountain top, and the water flows downhill to fill the hollows, crevices, and creeks. As they become full, they fill up the pools. The pools fill up the lakes, the lakes fill up the streams, and the streams fill up the rivers. And as the rivers become full, they fill up the ocean. 

In\marginnote{8.1} the same way, ignorance is a vital condition for choices. … Freedom is a vital condition for the knowledge of ending.”

Near\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, in the Bamboo Grove. Then Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} for alms. Then it occurred to him, “It’s too early to wander for alms in \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}. Why don’t I go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths?” 

Then\marginnote{2.1} he went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The wanderers said to him: 

“Reverend\marginnote{3.1} \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, there are ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds. Some of them declare that suffering is made by oneself. Some of them declare that suffering is made by another. Some of them declare that suffering is made by both oneself and another. Some of them declare that suffering arises by chance, not made by oneself or another. What does the ascetic Gotama say about this? How does he explain it? How should we answer so as to repeat what the ascetic Gotama has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should we explain in line with his teaching, with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?” 

“Reverends,\marginnote{4.1} the Buddha said that suffering is dependently originated. Dependent on what? Dependent on contact. If you said this you would repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth. You would explain in line with his teaching, and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism. 

Consider\marginnote{5.1} the ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds. In the case of those who declare that suffering is made by oneself, that’s conditioned by contact. In the case of those who declare that suffering is made by another, that’s also conditioned by contact. In the case of those who declare that suffering is made by oneself and another, that’s also conditioned by contact. In the case of those who declare that suffering arises by chance, not made by oneself or another, that’s also conditioned by contact. 

Consider\marginnote{6.1} the ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds. In the case of those who declare that suffering is made by oneself, it’s impossible that they will experience that without contact. In the case of those who declare that suffering is made by another, it’s impossible that they will experience that without contact. In the case of those who declare that suffering is made by oneself and another, it’s impossible that they will experience that without contact. In the case of those who declare that suffering arises by chance, not made by oneself or another, it’s impossible that they will experience that without contact.” 

Venerable\marginnote{7.1} Ānanda heard this discussion between Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} and those wanderers who follow other paths. Then Ānanda wandered for alms in \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed. 

“Good,\marginnote{8.1} good, Ānanda! It’s just as \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} has so rightly explained. I have said that suffering is dependently originated. Dependent on what? Dependent on contact. Saying this you would repeat what I have said, and not misrepresent me with an untruth. You would explain in line with my teaching, and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism. 

Consider\marginnote{9.1} the ascetics and brahmins who teach the efficacy of deeds. In the case of those who declare that suffering is made by oneself, that’s conditioned by contact. … In the case of those who declare that suffering arises by chance, not made by oneself or another, that’s also conditioned by contact. 

In\marginnote{10.1} the case of those who declare that suffering is made by oneself, it’s impossible that they will experience that without contact. … In the case of those who declare that suffering arises by chance, not made by oneself or another, it’s impossible that they will experience that without contact. 

Ānanda,\marginnote{11.1} this one time I was staying near \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. Then I robed up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, entered \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} for alms. Then I thought: ‘It’s too early to wander for alms in \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}. Why don’t I go to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths?’ 

Then\marginnote{12.1} I went to the monastery of the wanderers who follow other paths, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, I sat down to one side. …” 

(The\marginnote{13.1} wanderers asked the Buddha the very same questions, and he gave the same answers.) 

“It’s\marginnote{17.1} incredible, sir, it’s amazing, how the whole matter is stated with one phrase. Could there be a detailed explanation of this matter that is both deep and appears deep?” 

“Well\marginnote{18.1} then, Ānanda, clarify this matter yourself.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{18.2} suppose they were to ask me: ‘Reverend Ānanda, what is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of old age and death?’ I’d answer like this: ‘Reverends, rebirth is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of old age and death.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question. 

Suppose\marginnote{19.1} they were to ask me: ‘What is the source of rebirth?’ I’d answer like this: ‘Continued existence is the source of rebirth.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question. 

Suppose\marginnote{20.1} they were to ask me: ‘What is the source of continued existence?’ I’d answer like this: ‘Grasping is the source of continued existence.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question. 

Suppose\marginnote{21.1} they were to ask me: ‘What is the source of grasping?’ … craving … feeling … Suppose they were to ask me: ‘What is the source of contact?’ I’d answer like this: ‘The six sense fields are the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of contact.’ ‘When the six fields of contact fade away and cease with nothing left over, contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.”

Then\marginnote{1.2} in the late afternoon, Venerable \textsanskrit{Bhūmija} came out of retreat, went to Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him:

Venerable\marginnote{6.1} Ānanda heard this discussion between Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} and Venerable \textsanskrit{Bhūmija}. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed. 

“Good,\marginnote{7.1} good, Ānanda! It’s just as \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} has so rightly explained. I have said that pleasure and pain are dependently originated. Dependent on what?

Ānanda,\marginnote{10.1} as long as there’s a body, the intention that gives rise to bodily action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself. As long as there’s a voice, the intention that gives rise to verbal action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself. As long as there’s a mind, the intention that gives rise to mental action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself. But these only apply when conditioned by ignorance. 

By\marginnote{11.1} oneself one instigates the choice that gives rise to bodily, verbal, and mental action, conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself. Or else others instigate the choice … One consciously instigates the choice … Or else one unconsciously instigates the choice … 

Ignorance\marginnote{14.1} is included in all these things. But when ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, there is no body and no voice and no mind, conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself. There is no field, no ground, no scope, no basis, conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself.”

Then\marginnote{1.2} Venerable \textsanskrit{Upavāṇa} went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.1} there are some ascetics and brahmins who declare that suffering is made by oneself. There are some who declare that suffering is made by another. There are some who declare that suffering is made by both oneself and another. There are some who declare that suffering arises by chance, not made by oneself or another. 

What\marginnote{2.5} does the Buddha say about this? How does he explain it? How should we answer so as to repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? How should we explain in line with his teaching, with no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?” 

“\textsanskrit{Upavāṇa},\marginnote{3.1} I have said that suffering is dependently originated. Dependent on what? Dependent on contact. Saying this you would repeat what I have said, and not misrepresent me with an untruth. You would explain in line with my teaching, and there would be no legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism. 

In\marginnote{4.1} the case of those ascetics and brahmins who declare that suffering is made by oneself, that’s conditioned by contact. … In the case of those who declare that suffering arises by chance, not made by oneself or another, that’s also conditioned by contact.

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

Then\marginnote{1.2} the Buddha said to Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, “\textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, this was said in ‘The Way to the Far Shore’, in ‘The Questions of Ajita’: 

\begin{verse}%
‘There\marginnote{2.1} are those who have assessed the teaching, \\
and many kinds of trainees here. \\
Tell me about their behavior, good sir, \\

%
\end{verse}

How\marginnote{3.1} should we see the detailed meaning of this brief statement?” 

When\marginnote{3.2} he said this, \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} kept silent. 

For\marginnote{4.1} a second time … 

For\marginnote{4.3} a third time … 

\textsanskrit{Sāriputta}\marginnote{6.1} kept silent. 

“\textsanskrit{Sāriputta},\marginnote{7.1} do you see that this has come to be?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{7.2} one truly sees with right wisdom that this has come to be. Seeing this, one is practicing for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding what has come to be. One truly sees with right wisdom that it originated with that as fuel. Seeing this, one is practicing for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding the fuel for its origination. One truly sees with right wisdom that when that fuel ceases, what has come to be is liable to cease. Seeing this, one is practicing for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding what is liable to cease. In this way one is a trainee. 

And\marginnote{8.1} what, sir, is one who has assessed the teaching? Sir, one truly sees with right wisdom that this has come to be. Seeing this, one is freed by not grasping through disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding what has come to be. One truly sees with right wisdom that it originated with that as fuel. Seeing this, one is freed by not grasping through disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding the fuel for its origination. One truly sees with right wisdom that when that fuel ceases, what has come to be is liable to cease. Seeing this, one is freed by not grasping through disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding what is liable to cease. In this way one has assessed the teaching.

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

Then\marginnote{1.2} the mendicant \textsanskrit{Kaḷāra} the Aristocrat went up to Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to him, “Reverend \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, the mendicant Phagguna of the Top-Knot has resigned the training and returned to a lesser life.” 

“That\marginnote{1.5} venerable mustn’t have got any satisfaction in this teaching and training.” 

“Well\marginnote{2.1} then, has Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} found satisfaction in this teaching and training?” 

“Reverend,\marginnote{3.1} I have no uncertainty.” 

“But\marginnote{3.2} what of the future?” 

“I\marginnote{4.1} have no doubt.” 

Then\marginnote{5.1} \textsanskrit{Kaḷāra} the Aristocrat went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} has declared enlightenment: ‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’” 

So\marginnote{6.1} the Buddha addressed a certain monk, “Please, monk, in my name tell \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} that the teacher summons him.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{6.4} sir,” that monk replied. He went to \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} and said to him, “Reverend \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, the teacher summons you.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{6.6} reverend,” replied \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, “\textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, is it really true that you have declared enlightenment: ‘I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence”’?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{6.9} I did not state the matter in these words and phrases.” 

“\textsanskrit{Sāriputta},\marginnote{6.10} no matter how a gentleman declares enlightenment, what he has declared should be regarded as such.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{6.11} did I not also say that I did not state the matter in these words and phrases?” 

“\textsanskrit{Sāriputta},\marginnote{7.1} suppose they were to ask you: ‘But Reverend \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, how have you known and seen so that you’ve declared enlightenment: “I understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”’ How would you answer?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{8.1} if they were to ask me this, I would answer: ‘Reverends, because of the ending of the source of rebirth, when it ended, I knew “it is ended”. Knowing this, I understand: “Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.”’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.” 

“But\marginnote{9.1} \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, suppose they were to ask you: ‘But what is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of rebirth?’ How would you answer?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{9.4} if they were to ask me this, I would answer: ‘Continued existence is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of rebirth.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.” 

“But\marginnote{10.1} \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, suppose they were to ask you: ‘What is the source of continued existence?’ How would you answer?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{10.4} if they were to ask me this, I’d answer: ‘Grasping is the source of continued existence.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.” 

“But\marginnote{11.1} \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, suppose they were to ask you: ‘What is the source of grasping?’ … But \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, suppose they were to ask you: ‘What is the source of craving?’ How would you answer?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{11.6} if they were to ask me this, I’d answer: ‘Feeling is the source of craving.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.” 

“But\marginnote{12.1} \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, suppose they were to ask you: ‘But how have you known and seen so that the relishing of feelings is no longer present?’ How would you answer?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{12.4} if they were to ask me this, I’d answer: ‘Reverends, there are three feelings. What three? Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling. These three feelings are impermanent, and what’s impermanent is suffering. When I understood this, the relishing of feelings was no longer present.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.” 

“Good,\marginnote{13.1} good, \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}! The same point may also be briefly explained in this way: ‘Suffering includes whatever is felt.’ 

But\marginnote{14.1} \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, suppose they were to ask you: ‘But Reverend, how have you been released that you declare enlightenment: “I understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”?’ How would you answer?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{14.5} if they were to ask me this, I’d answer: ‘Because of an inner release with the ending of all grasping, I live mindfully so that defilements don’t defile me and I don’t look down on myself.’ That’s how I’d answer such a question.” 

“Good,\marginnote{15.1} good, \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}! The same point may also be briefly explained in this way: ‘I have no uncertainty regarding the defilements spoken of by the ascetic. I have no doubt that I’ve given them up.’” 

That\marginnote{15.4} is what the Buddha said. When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. 

Then\marginnote{16.1} soon after the Buddha left, Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} said to the mendicants, “Reverends, the first question that the Buddha asked me was something that I’d not previously considered, so I hesitated. But when the Buddha agreed with my answer, I thought: ‘If the Buddha were to question me all day on this matter in different words and ways, I could answer all day with different words and ways. If he were to question me all night, all day and night, for two days and nights, for three, four, five, six, or seven days and nights, I could answer in different words and ways for seven days and nights.’” 

Then\marginnote{17.1} \textsanskrit{Kaḷāra} the Aristocrat went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} has roared his lion’s roar!” (And he told the Buddha all that \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} had said.) 

“Mendicant,\marginnote{18.1} \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} has clearly comprehended the principle of the teachings, so that he could answer any questions I might ask him in different words and ways up to the seventh day and night.”

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} I will teach forty-four grounds for knowledge. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.4} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“And\marginnote{2.1} what are the forty-four grounds for knowledge? Knowledge of old age and death, knowledge of the origin of old age and death, knowledge of the cessation of old age and death, and knowledge of the practice that leads to the cessation of old age and death. Knowledge of rebirth … Knowledge of continued existence … Knowledge of grasping … Knowledge of craving … Knowledge of feeling … Knowledge of contact … Knowledge of the six sense fields … Knowledge of name and form … Knowledge of consciousness … Knowledge of choices, knowledge of the origin of choices, knowledge of the cessation of choices, and knowledge of the practice that leads to the cessation of choices. These are called the forty-four grounds for knowledge. 

And\marginnote{3.1} what is old age and death? The old age, decrepitude, broken teeth, grey hair, wrinkly skin, diminished vitality, and failing faculties of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings. This is called old age. The passing away, perishing, disintegration, demise, mortality, death, decease, breaking up of the aggregates, and laying to rest of the corpse of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings. This is called death. Such is old age, and such is death. This is called old age and death. 

Rebirth\marginnote{4.1} is the origin of old age and death. When rebirth ceases, old age and death cease. The practice that leads to the cessation of old age and death is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 

A\marginnote{5.1} noble disciple understands old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation. This is their knowledge of the present phenomenon. With this present phenomenon that is seen, known, immediate, attained, and fathomed, they infer to the past and future. 

Whatever\marginnote{6.1} ascetics and brahmins in the past directly knew old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation, all of them directly knew these things in exactly the same way that I do now.

A\marginnote{8.1} noble disciple has purified and cleansed these two knowledges—knowledge of the present phenomena, and inferential knowledge. When a noble disciple has done this, they’re called ‘one accomplished in view’, ‘one accomplished in vision’, ‘one who has come to the true teaching’, ‘one who sees this true teaching’, ‘one endowed with a trainee’s knowledge’, ‘one who has entered the stream of the teaching’, ‘a noble one with penetrative wisdom’, and ‘one who stands pushing open the door of the deathless’. 

And\marginnote{9.1} what is rebirth? … And what is continued existence? … And what is grasping? … And what is craving? … And what is feeling? … And what is contact? … And what are the six sense fields? … And what are name and form? … And what is consciousness? … And what are choices? There are three kinds of choices. Choices by way of body, speech, and mind. These are called choices. 

Ignorance\marginnote{10.1} is the origin of choices. When ignorance ceases, choices cease. The practice that leads to the cessation of choices is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. 

A\marginnote{11.1} noble disciple understands choices, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation. This is their knowledge of the present phenomenon. With this present phenomenon that is seen, known, immediate, attained, and fathomed, they infer to the past and future. 

Whatever\marginnote{12.1} ascetics and brahmins in the past directly knew choices, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation, all of them directly knew these things in exactly the same way that I do now.

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} I will teach seventy-seven grounds for knowledge. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.4} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“And\marginnote{2.1} what are the seventy-seven grounds for knowledge? The knowledge that rebirth is a condition for old age and death, and the knowledge that when rebirth doesn’t exist, there is no old age and death. Also regarding the past: the knowledge that rebirth is a condition for old age and death, and the knowledge that when rebirth doesn’t exist, there is no old age and death. Also regarding the future: the knowledge that rebirth is a condition for old age and death, and the knowledge that when rebirth doesn’t exist, there is no old age and death. And also their knowledge that even this knowledge of the stability of natural principles is liable to end, vanish, fade away, and cease. 

The\marginnote{3.1} knowledge that continued existence is a condition for rebirth … The knowledge that ignorance is a condition for choices, and the knowledge that when ignorance doesn’t exist, there are no choices.

And also their knowledge that even this knowledge of the stability of natural principles is liable to end, vanish, fade away, and cease. These are called the seventy-seven grounds for knowledge.”

“Ignorance\marginnote{1.2} is a condition for choices. 

Choices\marginnote{1.3} are a condition for consciousness. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.” 

When\marginnote{1.5} this was said, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha, “What are old age and death, sir, and who do they belong to?” 

“That’s\marginnote{1.7} not a fitting question,” said the Buddha. “You might say, ‘What are old age and death, and who do they belong to?’ Or you might say, ‘Old age and death are one thing, who they belong to is another.’ But both of these mean the same thing, only the phrasing differs. Mendicant, if you have the view that the soul and the body are the same thing, there is no living of the spiritual life. If you have the view that the soul and the body are different things, there is no living of the spiritual life. Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way: ‘Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’” 

“What\marginnote{2.1} is rebirth, sir, and who does it belong to?” 

“That’s\marginnote{2.2} not a fitting question,” said the Buddha. “You might say, ‘What is rebirth, and who does it belong to?’ Or you might say, ‘Rebirth is one thing, who it belongs to is another.’ But both of these mean the same thing, only the phrasing differs. Mendicant, if you have the view that the soul and the body are the same thing, there is no living of the spiritual life. If you have the view that the soul and the body are different things, there is no living of the spiritual life. Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way: ‘Continued existence is a condition for rebirth.’” 

“What\marginnote{3.1} is continued existence, sir, and who is it for?” 

“That’s\marginnote{3.2} not a fitting question,” said the Buddha. “You might say, ‘What is continued existence, and who does it belong to?’ Or you might say, ‘Continued existence is one thing, who it belongs to is another.’ But both of these mean the same thing, only the phrasing differs. Mendicant, if you have the view that the soul and the body are identical, there is no living of the spiritual life. If you have the view that the soul and the body are different things, there is no living of the spiritual life. Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way: ‘Grasping is a condition for continued existence.’ … ‘Craving is a condition for grasping.’ … ‘Feeling is a condition for craving.’ … ‘Contact is a condition for feeling.’ … ‘The six sense fields are conditions for contact.’ … ‘Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields.’ … ‘Consciousness is a condition for name and form.’ … ‘Choices are a condition for consciousness.’” 

“What\marginnote{4.1} are choices, sir, and who do they belong to?” 

“That’s\marginnote{4.2} not a fitting question,” said the Buddha. “You might say, ‘What are choices, and who do they belong to?’ Or you might say, ‘Choices are one thing, who they belong to is another.’ But both of these mean the same thing, only the phrasing differs. Mendicant, if you have the view that the soul and the body are the same thing, there is no living of the spiritual life. If you have the view that the soul and the body are different things, there is no living of the spiritual life. Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way: ‘Ignorance is a condition for choices.’ 

When\marginnote{5.1} ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, then any tricks, dodges, and evasions are given up: ‘What are old age and death, and who do they belong to?’ or ‘old age and death are one thing, who they belong to is another’, or ‘the soul and the body are the same thing’, or ‘the soul and the body are different things.’ These are all cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. 

When\marginnote{6.1} ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, then any tricks, dodges, and evasions are given up: ‘What is rebirth, and who does it belong to?’ or ‘rebirth is one thing, who it belongs to is another’, or ‘the soul and the body are the same thing’, or ‘the soul and the body are different things.’ These are all cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. 

When\marginnote{7.1} ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, then any tricks, dodges, and evasions are given up: ‘What is continued existence …’ ‘What is grasping …’ ‘What is craving …’ ‘What is feeling …’ ‘What is contact …’ ‘What are the six sense fields …’ ‘What are name and form …’ ‘What is consciousness …’ 

When\marginnote{8.1} ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, then any tricks, dodges, and evasions are given up: ‘What are choices, and who do they belong to?’ or ‘choices are one thing, who they belong to is another’, or ‘the soul and the body are the same thing’, or ‘the soul and the body are different things.’ These are all cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.”

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

Then\marginnote{1.2} the householder \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika} went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Seated to one side, the Buddha said to the householder \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}: 

“Householder,\marginnote{2.1} when a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble cycle with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’ 

What\marginnote{3.1} are the five dangers and threats they have quelled? Anyone who kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. That danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from killing living creatures. 

Anyone\marginnote{4.1} who steals creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. That danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from stealing. 

Anyone\marginnote{5.1} who commits sexual misconduct creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. That danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from committing sexual misconduct. 

Anyone\marginnote{6.1} who lies creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. That danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from lying. 

Anyone\marginnote{7.1} who uses alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. That danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. These are the five dangers and threats they have quelled. 

What\marginnote{8.1} are the four factors of stream-entry that they have? It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ 

They\marginnote{9.1} have experiential confidence in the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ 

They\marginnote{10.1} have experiential confidence in the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}: ‘The \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ 

And\marginnote{11.1} a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. These are the four factors of stream-entry that they have. 

And\marginnote{12.1} what is the noble cycle that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom? A noble disciple carefully and properly attends to dependent origination itself: ‘When this exists, that is; when this doesn’t exist, that is not. Due to the arising of this, that arises; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. Ignorance is a condition for choices. 

Choices\marginnote{12.6} are a condition for consciousness. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’ This is the noble cycle that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom. 

When\marginnote{13.1} a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble cycle with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’”

Now\marginnote{6.1} at that time a certain monk was standing listening in on the Buddha. The Buddha saw him and said, “Monk, did you hear that exposition of the teaching?”

Then\marginnote{1.2} a certain brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: 

“Master\marginnote{2.1} Gotama, does the person who does the deed experience the result?” 

“‘The\marginnote{2.2} person who does the deed experiences the result’: this is one extreme, brahmin.” 

“Then\marginnote{3.1} does one person do the deed and another experience the result?” 

“‘One\marginnote{3.2} person does the deed and another experiences the result’: this is the second extreme. 

Avoiding\marginnote{3.3} these two extremes, the Realized One teaches by the middle way: ‘Ignorance is a condition for choices. 

Choices\marginnote{3.5} are a condition for consciousness. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’”

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” 

“Venerable\marginnote{1.5} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.1} how do you define a mendicant who is making a full inquiry for the complete ending of suffering?” 

“Our\marginnote{2.2} teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” 

“Well\marginnote{2.3} then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{2.4} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{3.1} take a mendicant who makes a full inquiry: ‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms. What is the source, origin, birthplace, and inception of this suffering? When what exists do old age and death come to be? When what does not exist do old age and death not come to be?’ While making a full inquiry they understand: ‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms. The source of this suffering is rebirth. When rebirth exists, old age and death come to be. When rebirth doesn’t exist, old age and death don’t come to be.’ 

They\marginnote{4.1} understand old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for their cessation. And they practice in line with that path. This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of old age and death. 

Then\marginnote{5.1} they inquire further: ‘But what is the source of this rebirth? When what exists does rebirth come to be? And when what does not exist does rebirth not come to be?’ While making a full inquiry they understand: ‘Continued existence is the source of rebirth. When continued existence exists, rebirth comes to be. When continued existence does not exist, rebirth doesn’t come to be.’ 

They\marginnote{6.1} understand rebirth, its origin, its cessation, and the fitting practice for its cessation. And they practice in line with that path. This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of rebirth. 

Then\marginnote{7.1} they inquire further: ‘But what is the source of this continued existence? …’ … ‘But what is the source of this grasping? …’ … ‘But what is the source of this craving? …’ … ‘But what is the source of this feeling? …’ … ‘But what is the source of this contact? …’ … ‘But what is the source of these six sense fields? …’ … ‘But what is the source of this name and form? …’ … ‘But what is the source of this consciousness? …’ … ‘But what is the source of these choices? When what exists do choices come to be? When what does not exist do choices not come to be?’ While making a full inquiry they understand: ‘Ignorance is the source of choices. When ignorance exists, choices come to be. When ignorance does not exist, choices don’t come to be.’ 

They\marginnote{8.1} understand choices, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for their cessation. And they practice in line with that path. This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of choices. 

If\marginnote{9.1} an ignorant individual makes a good choice, their consciousness enters a good realm. If they make a bad choice, their consciousness enters a bad realm. If they make an imperturbable choice, their consciousness enters an imperturbable realm. When a mendicant has given up ignorance and given rise to knowledge, they don’t make a good choice, a bad choice, or an imperturbable choice. Not choosing or intending, they don’t grasp at anything in the world. Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished. 

They\marginnote{9.7} understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ 

If\marginnote{10.1} they feel a pleasant feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. If they feel a painful feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. If they feel a neutral feeling, they understand that it’s impermanent, that they’re not attached to it, and that they don’t take pleasure in it. If they feel a pleasant feeling, they feel it detached. If they feel a painful feeling, they feel it detached. If they feel a neutral feeling, they feel it detached. 

Feeling\marginnote{11.1} the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’ They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here. Only bodily remains will be left.’ 

Suppose\marginnote{12.1} a person were to remove a hot clay pot from a potter’s kiln and place it down on level ground. Its heat would dissipate right there, and the shards would be left behind. 

In\marginnote{12.3} the same way, feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’ They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, since I no longer take pleasure in it, will become cool right here. Only bodily remains will be left.’ 

What\marginnote{13.1} do you think, mendicants? Would a mendicant who has ended the defilements still make good choices, bad choices, or imperturbable choices?” 

“No,\marginnote{13.3} sir.” 

“And\marginnote{14.1} when there are no choices at all, with the cessation of choices, would consciousness still be found?” 

“No,\marginnote{14.2} sir.” 

“And\marginnote{15.1} when there’s no consciousness at all, would name and form still be found?” 

“No,\marginnote{15.2} sir.” 

“And\marginnote{16.1} when there are no name and form at all, would the six sense fields still be found?” 

“No,\marginnote{16.2} sir.” 

“And\marginnote{17.1} when there are no six sense fields at all, would contact still be found?” 

“No,\marginnote{17.2} sir.” 

“And\marginnote{18.1} when there’s no contact at all, would feeling still be found?” 

“No,\marginnote{18.2} sir.” 

“And\marginnote{19.1} when there’s no feeling at all, would craving still be found?” 

“No,\marginnote{19.2} sir.” 

“And\marginnote{20.1} when there’s no craving at all, would grasping still be found?” 

“No,\marginnote{20.2} sir.” 

“And\marginnote{21.1} when there’s no grasping at all, would continued existence still be found?” 

“No,\marginnote{21.2} sir.” 

“And\marginnote{22.1} when there’s no continued existence at all, would rebirth still be found?” 

“No,\marginnote{22.2} sir.” 

“And\marginnote{23.1} when there’s no rebirth at all, would old age and death still be found?” 

“No,\marginnote{23.2} sir.” 

“Good,\marginnote{24.1} good, mendicants! That’s how it is, not otherwise. Trust me on this, mendicants; be convinced. Have no doubts or uncertainties in this matter. Just this is the end of suffering.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named \textsanskrit{Kammāsadamma}. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha: 

“It’s\marginnote{1.3} incredible, sir! It’s amazing, in that this dependent origination is deep and appears deep, yet to me it seems as plain as can be.” 

“Not\marginnote{2.1} so, Ānanda! Not so, Ānanda! This dependent origination is deep and appears deep. It is because of not understanding and not penetrating this teaching that this population has become tangled like string, knotted like a ball of thread, and matted like rushes and reeds, and it doesn’t escape the places of loss, the bad places, the underworld, transmigration. 

There\marginnote{3.1} are things that are prone to being grasped. When you concentrate on the gratification provided by these things, your craving grows. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. 

Suppose\marginnote{4.1} there was a great tree. And its roots going downwards and across all draw the sap upwards. Fueled and sustained by that, the great tree would stand for a long time.

Then they’d split the tree apart, cut up the parts, and chop it into splinters. They’d dry the splinters in the wind and sun, burn them with fire, and reduce them to ashes. Then they’d winnow the ashes in a strong wind, or float them away down a swift stream. In this way the great tree is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. 

In\marginnote{6.8} the same way, there are things that are prone to being grasped. When you concentrate on the drawbacks of these things, your craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases.

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. … 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.3} when it comes to this body made up of the four primary elements, an unlearned ordinary person might become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed. Why is that? This body made up of the four primary elements is seen to accumulate and disperse, to be taken up and laid to rest. That’s why, when it comes to this body, an unlearned ordinary person might become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed. 

But\marginnote{2.1} when it comes to that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’, an unlearned ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned, dispassionate, or freed. Why is that? Because for a long time they’ve been attached to it, thought of it as their own, and mistaken it: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self.’ That’s why, when it comes to this mind, an unlearned ordinary person is unable to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed. 

But\marginnote{3.1} an unlearned ordinary person would be better off taking this body made up of the four primary elements to be their self, rather than the mind. Why is that? This body made up of the four primary elements is seen to last for a year, or for two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or a hundred years, or even longer. 

But\marginnote{4.1} that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all night. It’s like a monkey moving through the forest. It grabs hold of one branch, lets it go, and grabs another; then it lets that go and grabs yet another. In the same way, that which is called ‘mind’ or ‘sentience’ or ‘consciousness’ arises as one thing and ceases as another all day and all night. 

In\marginnote{5.1} this case, a learned noble disciple carefully and properly attends to dependent origination itself: ‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises. When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. That is: Ignorance is a condition for choices. 

Choices\marginnote{5.5} are a condition for consciousness. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’ 

Seeing\marginnote{6.1} this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. 

They\marginnote{6.3} understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”

With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as painful, the corresponding painful feeling ceases and stops. Neutral feeling arises dependent on a contact to be experienced as neutral. With the cessation of that contact to be experienced as neutral, the corresponding neutral feeling ceases and stops. 

When\marginnote{4.1} you rub two sticks together, heat is generated and fire is produced. But when you part the sticks and lay them aside, any corresponding heat ceases and stops.

At\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī}. 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} there are these four fuels. They maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born. What four? Solid food, whether coarse or fine; contact is the second, mental intention the third, and consciousness the fourth. These are the four fuels that maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born. 

And\marginnote{2.1} how should you regard solid food? Suppose a couple who were husband and wife set out to cross a desert, taking limited supplies. They had an only child, dear and beloved. As the couple were crossing the desert their limited quantity of supplies would run out, and they’d still have the rest of the desert to cross. Then it would occur to that couple: ‘Our limited quantity of supplies has run out, and we still have the rest of the desert to cross. Why don’t we kill our only child, so dear and beloved, and prepare dried and spiced meat? Then we can make it across the desert by eating our child’s flesh. Let not all three perish.’ Then that couple would kill their only child, so dear and beloved, and prepare dried and spiced meat. They’d make it across the desert by eating their child’s flesh. And as they’d eat their child’s flesh, they’d beat their breasts and cry: ‘Where are you, our only child? Where are you, our only child?’ 

What\marginnote{3.1} do you think, mendicants? Would they eat that food for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration?” 

“No,\marginnote{3.3} sir.” 

“Wouldn’t\marginnote{3.4} they eat that food just so they could make it across the desert?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{3.5} sir.” 

“I\marginnote{3.6} say that this is how you should regard solid food. When solid food is completely understood, desire for the five kinds of sensual stimulation is completely understood. When desire for the five kinds of sensual stimulation is completely understood, a noble disciple is bound by no fetter that might return them again to this world. 

And\marginnote{4.1} how should you regard contact as fuel? Suppose there was a flayed cow. If she stands by a wall, the creatures on the wall bite her. If she stands under a tree, the creatures in the tree bite her. If she stands in some water, the creatures in the water bite her. If she stands in the open, the creatures in the open bite her. Wherever that flayed cow stands, the creatures there would bite her. I say that this is how you should regard contact as fuel. When contact as fuel is completely understood, the three feelings are completely understood. When the three feelings are completely understood, a noble disciple has nothing further to do, I say. 

And\marginnote{5.1} how should you regard mental intention as fuel? Suppose there was a pit of glowing coals deeper than a man’s height, filled with glowing coals that neither flamed nor smoked. Then a person would come along who wants to live and doesn’t want to die, who wants to be happy and recoils from pain. Then two strong men would grab them by the arms and drag them towards the pit of glowing coals. Then that person’s intention, aim, and wish would be to get far away. Why is that? Because that person would think: ‘If I fall in that pit of glowing coals, that will result in my death or deadly pain.’ I say that this is how you should regard mental intention as fuel. When mental intention as fuel is completely understood, the three cravings are completely understood. When the three cravings are completely understood, a noble disciple has nothing further to do, I say. 

And\marginnote{6.1} how should you regard consciousness as fuel? Suppose they were to arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to the king, saying: ‘Your Majesty, this is a bandit, a criminal. Punish him as you will.’ The king would say: ‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the morning with a hundred spears!’ The king’s men did as they were told. Then at midday the king would say: ‘My men, how is that man?’ ‘He’s still alive, Your Majesty.’ The king would say: ‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the middle of the day with a hundred spears!’ The king’s men did as they were told. Then late in the afternoon the king would say: ‘My men, how is that man?’ ‘He’s still alive, Your Majesty.’ The king would say: ‘Go, my men, and strike this man in the late afternoon with a hundred spears!’ The king’s men did as they were told. 

What\marginnote{6.19} do you think, mendicants? Would that man experience pain and distress from being struck with three hundred spears a day?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{6.21} that man would experience pain and distress from being struck with one spear, let alone three hundred spears!” 

“I\marginnote{6.23} say that this is how you should regard consciousness as fuel. When consciousness as fuel is completely understood, name and form is completely understood. When name and form are completely understood, a noble disciple has nothing further to do, I say.”

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I thought: ‘Alas, this world has fallen into trouble. It’s born, grows old, dies, passes away, and is reborn, yet it doesn’t understand how to escape from this suffering, from old age and death. Oh, when will an escape be found from this suffering, from old age and death?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘When what exists is there old age and death? What is a condition for old age and death?’ Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: ‘When rebirth exists there’s old age and death. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death.’ 

Then\marginnote{2.1} it occurred to me: ‘When what exists is there rebirth? … continued existence … grasping … craving … feeling … contact … the six sense fields … name and form … What is a condition for name and form?’ Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: ‘When consciousness exists there are name and form. Consciousness is a condition for name and form.’ Then it occurred to me: ‘When what exists is there consciousness? What is a condition for consciousness?’ Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: ‘When name and form exist there’s consciousness. Name and form are a condition for consciousness.’ 

Then\marginnote{3.1} it occurred to me: This consciousness turns back from name and form, and doesn’t go beyond that. This is the extent to which one may be reborn, grow old, die, pass away, or reappear. That is: name and form are conditions for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. ‘Origination, origination.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another. 

Then\marginnote{4.1} it occurred to me: ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no old age and death? When what ceases do old age and death cease?’ Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: ‘When rebirth doesn’t exist there is no old age and death. When rebirth ceases old age and death cease.’ Then it occurred to me: ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no rebirth … continued existence … grasping … craving … feeling … contact … six sense fields … name and form? When what ceases do name and form cease?’ Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: ‘When consciousness doesn’t exist there is no name and form. When consciousness ceases name and form cease.’ 

Then\marginnote{5.1} it occurred to me: ‘When what doesn’t exist is there no consciousness? When what ceases does consciousness cease?’ Then, through proper attention, I comprehended with wisdom: ‘When name and form don’t exist, there is no consciousness. When name and form cease, consciousness ceases.’ 

Then\marginnote{6.1} it occurred to me: I have discovered the path to awakening. That is: When name and form cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases. ‘Cessation, cessation.’ Such was the vision, knowledge, wisdom, realization, and light that arose in me regarding teachings not learned before from another. 

Suppose\marginnote{7.1} a person was walking through a forest. They’d see an ancient path, an ancient route traveled by humans in the past. Following it along, they’d see an ancient city, an ancient capital, inhabited by humans in the past. It was lovely, complete with parks, groves, lotus ponds, and embankments. Then that person would inform a king or their minister: ‘Please sir, you should know this. While walking through a forest I saw an ancient path, an ancient route traveled by humans in the past. Following it along I saw an ancient city, an ancient capital, inhabited by humans in the past. It was lovely, complete with parks, groves, lotus ponds, and embankments. Sir, you should rebuild that city!’ Then that king or their minister would have that city rebuilt. And after some time that city was successful and prosperous and full of people, attained to growth and expansion. In the same way, I saw an ancient path, an ancient route traveled by fully awakened Buddhas in the past. 

And\marginnote{8.1} what is that ancient path, the ancient road traveled by fully awakened Buddhas in the past? It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. This is that ancient path, the ancient road traveled by fully awakened Buddhas in the past. 

Following\marginnote{8.5} it along, I directly knew old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation. Following it along, I directly knew rebirth … continued existence … grasping … craving … feeling … contact … the six sense fields … name and form … consciousness … Following it along, I directly knew choices, their origin, their cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation. 

Having\marginnote{8.24} directly known this, I told the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. And that’s how this spiritual life has become successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.”

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named \textsanskrit{Kammāsadamma}. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” 

“Venerable\marginnote{1.5} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.7} do you perform inner self-examination?” 

When\marginnote{1.8} he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha, “Sir, I perform inner self-examination.” 

“But\marginnote{1.10} mendicant, how do you perform inner self-examination?” Then that mendicant answered, but the Buddha was not happy with the answer. 

When\marginnote{2.1} he had spoken, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, “Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! Let the Buddha speak of the inner self-examination. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” 

“Well\marginnote{2.4} then, Ānanda, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{2.5} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“Take\marginnote{3.1} a mendicant who performs inner self-examination: ‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms. But what is the source of this suffering? When what exists do old age and death come to be? And when what does not exist do old age and death not come to be?’ While examining they know: ‘The suffering that arises in the world starting with old age and death takes many and diverse forms. The source of this suffering is attachment. When attachments exist old age and death come to be. And when attachments do not exist old age and death don’t come to be.’ They understand old age and death, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for their cessation. And they practice in line with that path. This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of old age and death. 

They\marginnote{4.1} perform further inner self-examination: ‘But what is the source of this attachment? When what exists does attachment come to be? And when what does not exist does attachment not come to be?’ While examining they know: ‘The source of this attachment is craving. When craving exists attachments come to be. And when craving doesn’t exist attachments don’t come to be.’ They understand attachments, their origin, their cessation, and the fitting practice for their cessation. And they practice in line with that path. This is called a mendicant who is practicing for the complete ending of suffering, for the cessation of attachments. 

They\marginnote{5.1} perform further inner self-examination: ‘But where does that craving arise and where does it settle?’ While examining they know: ‘That craving arises and settles on whatever in the world seems nice and pleasant. And what in the world seems nice and pleasant? The eye in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles. The ear … nose … tongue … body … mind in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles.’ 

There\marginnote{6.1} were ascetics and brahmins of the past who saw the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as permanent, as pleasurable, as self, as healthy, and as safe. Their craving grew. As their craving grew, their attachments grew. As their attachments grew, their suffering grew. And as their suffering grew, they were not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They were not freed from suffering, I say. 

There\marginnote{7.1} will be ascetics and brahmins in the future who will see the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as permanent, as pleasurable, as self, as healthy, and as safe. Their craving will grow. As their craving grows, their attachments will grow. As their attachments grow, their suffering will grow. And as their suffering grows, they will not be freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They will not be freed from suffering, I say. 

There\marginnote{8.1} are ascetics and brahmins in the present who see the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as permanent, as pleasurable, as self, as healthy, and as safe. Their craving grows. As their craving grows, their attachments grow. As their attachments grow, their suffering grows. And as their suffering grows, they are not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They are not freed from suffering, I say. 

Suppose\marginnote{9.1} there was a bronze cup of beverage that had a nice color, aroma, and flavor. But it was mixed with poison. Then along comes a man struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. They’d say to him: ‘Here, mister, this bronze cup of beverage has a nice color, aroma, and flavor. But it’s mixed with poison. Drink it if you like. If you drink it, the color, aroma, and flavor will be appetizing, but it will result in death or deadly pain.’ He wouldn’t reject that beverage. Hastily, without reflection, he’d drink it, resulting in death or deadly pain. 

In\marginnote{9.11} the same way, there are ascetics and brahmins of the past … future … There are ascetics and brahmins in the present who see the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as permanent, as pleasurable, as self, as healthy, and as safe. As their craving grows, their attachments grow. As their attachments grow, their suffering grows. And as their suffering grows, they are not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They are not freed from suffering, I say. 

There\marginnote{10.1} were ascetics and brahmins of the past who saw the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as impermanent, as suffering, as not-self, as diseased, and as dangerous. They gave up craving. Giving up craving, they gave up attachments. Giving up attachments, they gave up suffering. Giving up suffering, they were freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They were freed from suffering, I say. 

There\marginnote{11.1} will be ascetics and brahmins in the future who will see the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as impermanent, as suffering, as not-self, as diseased, and as dangerous. They will give up craving. Giving up craving … they will be freed from suffering, I say. 

There\marginnote{12.1} are ascetics and brahmins in the present who see the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as impermanent, as suffering, as not-self, as diseased, and as dangerous. They give up craving. Giving up craving, they give up attachments. Giving up attachments, they give up suffering. Giving up suffering, they are freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They are freed from suffering, I say. 

Suppose\marginnote{13.1} there was a bronze cup of beverage that had a nice color, aroma, and flavor. But it was mixed with poison. Then along comes a man struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. They’d say to him: ‘Here, mister, this bronze cup of beverage has a nice color, aroma, and flavor. But it’s mixed with poison. Drink it if you like. If you drink it, its nice color, aroma, and flavor will refresh you. But drinking it will result in death or deadly pain.’ Then that man might think: ‘I could quench my thirst with water, whey, seasoned drink, or broth. But I shouldn’t drink that beverage, for it would be for my lasting harm and suffering.’ He’d reject that beverage. After appraisal, he wouldn’t drink it, and it wouldn’t result in death or deadly pain. 

In\marginnote{13.13} the same way, there were ascetics and brahmins of the past who saw the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as impermanent, as suffering, as not-self, as diseased, and as dangerous. They gave up craving. Giving up craving, they gave up attachments. Giving up attachments, they gave up suffering. Giving up suffering, they were freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They were freed from suffering, I say. 

There\marginnote{14.1} will be ascetics and brahmins in the future … There are ascetics and brahmins in the present who see the things that seem nice and pleasant in the world as impermanent, as suffering, as not-self, as diseased, and as dangerous. They give up craving. Giving up craving, they give up attachments. Giving up attachments, they give up suffering. Giving up suffering, they are freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They are freed from suffering, I say.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} and Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahākoṭṭhita} were staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana. 

Then\marginnote{1.2} in the late afternoon, Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahākoṭṭhita} came out of retreat, went to Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}: 

“Well,\marginnote{1.4} Reverend \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, are old age and death made by oneself? Or by another? Or by both oneself and another? Or do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?” 

“No,\marginnote{1.5} Reverend \textsanskrit{Koṭṭhita}, old age and death are not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. Rather, rebirth is a condition for old age and death.” 

“Well,\marginnote{2.1} Reverend \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, is rebirth made by oneself? Or by another? Or by both oneself and another? Or does it arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?” 

“No,\marginnote{2.2} Reverend \textsanskrit{Koṭṭhita}, rebirth is not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor does it arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. Rather, continued existence is a condition for rebirth.” 

“Well,\marginnote{3.1} Reverend \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, is continued existence made by oneself? …” … “Is grasping made by oneself? …” … “Is craving made by oneself? …” … “Is feeling made by oneself? …” … “Is contact made by oneself? …” … “Are the six sense fields made by oneself? …” … “Well, Reverend \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, are name and form made by oneself? Or by another? Or by both oneself and another? Or do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?” 

“No,\marginnote{3.8} Reverend \textsanskrit{Koṭṭhita}, name and form are not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. Rather, consciousness is a condition for name and form.” 

“Well,\marginnote{4.1} Reverend \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, is consciousness made by oneself? Or by another? Or by both oneself and another? Or does it arise by chance, not made by oneself or another?” 

“No,\marginnote{4.2} Reverend \textsanskrit{Koṭṭhita}, consciousness is not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor does it arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. Rather, name and form are conditions for consciousness.” 

“Just\marginnote{5.1} now I understood you to say: ‘No, Reverend \textsanskrit{Koṭṭhita}, name and form are not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor do they arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. Rather, consciousness is a condition for name and form.’ 

But\marginnote{6.1} I also understood you to say: ‘No, Reverend \textsanskrit{Koṭṭhita}, consciousness is not made by oneself, nor by another, nor by both oneself and another, nor does it arise by chance, not made by oneself or another. Rather, name and form are conditions for consciousness.’ 

How\marginnote{7.1} then should we see the meaning of this statement?” 

“Well\marginnote{7.2} then, reverend, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said. Suppose there were two bundles of reeds leaning up against each other. 

In\marginnote{7.5} the same way, name and form are conditions for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. … That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. If the first of those bundles of reeds were to be pulled away, the other would collapse. And if the other were to be pulled away, the first would collapse. 

In\marginnote{7.12} the same way, when name and form cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. … That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.” 

“It’s\marginnote{8.1} incredible, Reverend \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}, it’s amazing! How well spoken this was by Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}! And we can express our agreement with Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta}’s statement on these thirty-six grounds. 

If\marginnote{9.1} a mendicant teaches Dhamma for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding old age and death, they’re qualified to be called a ‘mendicant who speaks on Dhamma’. If they practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding old age and death, they’re qualified to be called a ‘mendicant who practices in line with the teaching’. If they’re freed by not grasping by disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding old age and death, they’re qualified to be called a ‘mendicant who has attained extinguishment in this very life’. If a mendicant teaches Dhamma for disillusionment regarding rebirth … continued existence … grasping … craving … feeling … contact … the six sense fields … name and form … consciousness … choices … If a mendicant teaches Dhamma for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding ignorance, they’re qualified to be called a ‘mendicant who speaks on Dhamma’. If they practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding ignorance, they’re qualified to be called a ‘mendicant who practices in line with the teaching’. If they’re freed by not grasping by disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding ignorance, they’re qualified to be called a ‘mendicant who has attained extinguishment in this very life’.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the venerables \textsanskrit{Musīla}, \textsanskrit{Saviṭṭha}, \textsanskrit{Nārada}, and Ānanda were staying near \textsanskrit{Kosambī} in Ghosita’s monastery. Then Venerable \textsanskrit{Saviṭṭha} said to Venerable \textsanskrit{Musīla}: 

“Reverend\marginnote{1.3} \textsanskrit{Musīla}, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, do you know for yourself that rebirth is a condition for old age and death?” 

“Reverend\marginnote{1.5} \textsanskrit{Saviṭṭha}, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, I know and see that rebirth is a condition for old age and death.” 

“Reverend\marginnote{2.1} \textsanskrit{Musīla}, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, do you know for yourself that continued existence is a condition for rebirth … grasping is a condition for continued existence … craving is a condition for grasping … feeling is a condition for craving … contact is a condition for feeling … the six sense fields are conditions for contact … name and form are conditions for the six sense fields … consciousness is a condition for name and form … choices are a condition for consciousness … ignorance is a condition for choices?” 

“Reverend\marginnote{2.12} \textsanskrit{Saviṭṭha}, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, I know and see that ignorance is a condition for choices.” 

“Reverend\marginnote{3.1} \textsanskrit{Musīla}, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, do you know for yourself that when rebirth ceases, old age and death cease?” 

“Reverend\marginnote{3.3} \textsanskrit{Saviṭṭha}, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, I know and see that when rebirth ceases, old age and death cease.” 

“Reverend\marginnote{4.1} \textsanskrit{Musīla}, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, do you know for yourself that when continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases … when grasping ceases, continued existence ceases … when craving ceases, grasping ceases … when feeling ceases, craving ceases … when contact ceases, feeling ceases … when the six sense fields cease, contact ceases … when name and form cease, the six sense fields cease … when consciousness ceases name and form cease … when choices cease consciousness ceases … when ignorance ceases, choices cease?” 

“Reverend\marginnote{4.12} \textsanskrit{Saviṭṭha}, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, I know and see that when ignorance ceases, choices cease.” 

“Reverend\marginnote{5.1} \textsanskrit{Musīla}, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, do you know for yourself that the cessation of continued existence is extinguishment?” 

“Reverend\marginnote{5.3} \textsanskrit{Saviṭṭha}, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, I know and see that the cessation of continued existence is extinguishment.” 

“Then\marginnote{6.1} Venerable \textsanskrit{Musīla} is a perfected one, with defilements ended.” When he said this, \textsanskrit{Musīla} kept silent. 

Then\marginnote{7.1} Venerable \textsanskrit{Nārada} said to Venerable \textsanskrit{Saviṭṭha}, “Reverend \textsanskrit{Saviṭṭha}, please let me answer these questions. Ask me and I will answer them for you.” 

“By\marginnote{7.5} all means, Venerable \textsanskrit{Nārada}, try these questions. I’ll ask you and you can answer them for me.” 

(\textsanskrit{Saviṭṭha}\marginnote{8.1} repeats exactly the same series of questions, and \textsanskrit{Nārada} answers just as \textsanskrit{Musīla} did.) 

“Reverend\marginnote{12.1} \textsanskrit{Nārada}, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, do you know for yourself that the cessation of continued existence is extinguishment?” 

“Reverend\marginnote{12.3} \textsanskrit{Saviṭṭha}, apart from faith, preference, oral tradition, reasoned contemplation, or acceptance of a view after consideration, I know and see that the cessation of continued existence is extinguishment.” 

“Then\marginnote{13.1} Venerable \textsanskrit{Nārada} is a perfected one, with defilements ended.” 

“I\marginnote{13.2} have truly seen clearly with right wisdom that the cessation of continued existence is extinguishment. Yet I am not a perfected one. Suppose there was a well on a desert road that had neither rope nor bucket. Then along comes a person struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. They’d know that there was water, but they couldn’t physically touch it. 

In\marginnote{13.6} the same way, I have truly seen clearly with right wisdom that the cessation of continued existence is extinguishment. Yet I am not a perfected one.” 

When\marginnote{14.1} he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to Venerable \textsanskrit{Saviṭṭha}, “Reverend \textsanskrit{Saviṭṭha}, what do you have to say to Venerable \textsanskrit{Nārada} when he speaks like this?” 

“Reverend\marginnote{14.3} Ānanda, I have nothing to say to Venerable \textsanskrit{Nārada} when he speaks like this, except what is good and wholesome.”

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.4} when the ocean surges it makes the rivers surge. When the rivers surge they make the streams surge. When the streams surge they make the lakes surge. When the lakes surge they make the ponds surge. 

In\marginnote{1.5} the same way, when ignorance surges it makes choices surge. When choices surge they make consciousness surge. When consciousness surges it makes name and form surge.

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 

Now\marginnote{1.3} at that time the Buddha was honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And he received robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} was also honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And they received robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. But the wanderers who followed other paths were not honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And they didn’t receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. 

Now\marginnote{2.1} at that time the wanderer \textsanskrit{Susīma} was residing at \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} together with a large community of wanderers. 

Then\marginnote{2.2} his community said to \textsanskrit{Susīma}, “Reverend \textsanskrit{Susīma}, please lead the spiritual life with the ascetic Gotama. Memorize that teaching and have us recite it with you. When we’ve memorized it we’ll recite it to the laity. In this way we too will be honored, respected, revered, venerated, and esteemed. And we’ll receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{2.7} reverends,” replied \textsanskrit{Susīma}. Then he went to Venerable Ānanda, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda, “Reverend Ānanda, I wish to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.” 

Then\marginnote{3.1} Ānanda took \textsanskrit{Susīma} to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, this wanderer \textsanskrit{Susīma} says that he wishes to lead the spiritual life in this teaching and training.” 

“Well\marginnote{3.4} then, Ānanda, give \textsanskrit{Susīma} the going forth.” And the wanderer \textsanskrit{Susīma} received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. 

Now\marginnote{4.1} at that time several mendicants had declared their enlightenment in the Buddha’s presence: “We understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’” 

Venerable\marginnote{4.3} \textsanskrit{Susīma} heard about this. He went up to those mendicants, and exchanged greetings with them. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to those mendicants, “Is it really true that the venerables have declared enlightenment in the Buddha’s presence?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{4.10} reverend.” 

“But\marginnote{5.1} knowing and seeing thus, do you wield the many kinds of psychic power? That is, multiplying yourselves and becoming one again; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. Do you control the body as far as the \textsanskrit{Brahmā} realm?” 

“No,\marginnote{5.2} reverend.” 

“Well,\marginnote{6.1} knowing and seeing thus do you, with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far?” 

“No,\marginnote{6.2} reverend.” 

“Well,\marginnote{7.1} knowing and seeing thus, do you understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with your mind? Do you understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’, and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’? Do you understand mind with hate as ‘mind with hate’, and mind without hate as ‘mind without hate’? Do you understand mind with delusion as ‘mind with delusion’, and mind without delusion as ‘mind without delusion’? Do you understand constricted mind as ‘constricted mind’, and scattered mind as ‘scattered mind’? Do you understand expansive mind as ‘expansive mind’, and unexpansive mind as ‘unexpansive mind’? Do you understand mind that is not supreme as ‘mind that is not supreme’, and mind that is supreme as ‘mind that is supreme’? Do you understand mind immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi} as ‘mind immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi}’, and mind not immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi} as ‘mind not immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi}’? Do you understand freed mind as ‘freed mind’, and unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’?” 

“No,\marginnote{7.18} reverend.” 

“Well,\marginnote{8.1} knowing and seeing thus, do you recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding? Do you remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ Do you recollect your many kinds of past lives, with features and details?” 

“No,\marginnote{8.2} reverend.” 

“Well,\marginnote{9.1} knowing and seeing thus, do you, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place—and understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds? ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, do you see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. And do you understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds?” 

“No,\marginnote{9.2} reverend.” 

“Well,\marginnote{10.1} knowing and seeing thus, do you have direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless, transcending form?” 

“No,\marginnote{10.2} reverend.” 

“Well\marginnote{11.1} now, venerables, how could there be such a declaration when these things are not attained?” 

“Reverend\marginnote{11.2} \textsanskrit{Susīma}, we are freed by wisdom.” 

“I\marginnote{12.1} don’t understand the detailed meaning of what you have said in brief. Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.” 

“Reverend\marginnote{12.3} \textsanskrit{Susīma}, whether you understand or not, we are freed by wisdom.” 

Then\marginnote{13.1} \textsanskrit{Susīma} went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and informed the Buddha of all he had discussed with those mendicants. 

“\textsanskrit{Susīma},\marginnote{13.3} first comes knowledge of the stability of natural principles. Afterwards there is knowledge of extinguishment.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{14.1} I don’t understand the detailed meaning of what you have said in brief. Please teach me this matter so I can understand the detailed meaning.” 

“\textsanskrit{Susīma},\marginnote{14.3} whether you understand or not, first comes knowledge of the stability of natural principles. Afterwards there is knowledge of extinguishment. 

What\marginnote{15.1} do you think, \textsanskrit{Susīma}? Is form permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{15.3} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{15.4} if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” 

“Suffering,\marginnote{15.5} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{15.6} if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” 

“No,\marginnote{15.8} sir.” 

“Is\marginnote{15.9} feeling permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{15.10} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{15.11} if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” 

“Suffering,\marginnote{15.12} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{15.13} if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” 

“No,\marginnote{15.15} sir.” 

“Is\marginnote{15.16} perception permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{15.17} sir.” … 

“Are\marginnote{15.18} choices permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{15.19} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{15.20} if they’re impermanent, are they suffering or happiness?” 

“Suffering,\marginnote{15.21} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{15.22} if they’re impermanent, suffering, and perishable, are they fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” 

“No,\marginnote{15.24} sir.” 

“Is\marginnote{15.25} consciousness permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{15.26} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{15.27} if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” 

“Suffering,\marginnote{15.28} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{15.29} if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” 

“No,\marginnote{15.31} sir.” 

“So,\marginnote{16.1} \textsanskrit{Susīma}, you should truly see any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: \emph{all} form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ You should truly see any kind of feeling at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: \emph{all} feeling—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ You should truly see any kind of perception at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: \emph{all} perception—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ You should truly see any kind of choices at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: \emph{all choices}—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ You should truly see any kind of consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: \emph{all} consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ 

Seeing\marginnote{17.1} this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. 

They\marginnote{17.3} understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ 

\textsanskrit{Susīma},\marginnote{18.1} do you see that rebirth is a condition for old age and death?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{18.2} sir.” 

“Do\marginnote{18.3} you see that continued existence is a condition for rebirth?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{18.4} sir.” 

“Do\marginnote{18.5} you see that grasping is a condition for continued existence?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{18.6} sir.” 

“Do\marginnote{18.7} you see that craving is a condition for grasping?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{18.8} sir.” 

“Do\marginnote{18.9} you see that feeling is a condition for craving … contact is a condition for feeling … the six sense fields are conditions for contact … name and form are conditions for the six sense fields … consciousness is a condition for name and form … choices are a condition for consciousness … ignorance is a condition for choices?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{18.16} sir.” 

“Do\marginnote{19.1} you see that when rebirth ceases old age and death cease?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{19.2} sir.” 

“Do\marginnote{19.3} you see that when continued existence ceases rebirth ceases?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{19.4} sir.” 

“Do\marginnote{19.5} you see that when grasping ceases continued existence ceases … when craving ceases, grasping ceases … when feeling ceases, craving ceases … when contact ceases, feeling ceases … when the six sense fields cease, contact ceases … when name and form cease, the six sense fields cease … when consciousness ceases name and form cease … when choices cease consciousness ceases … when ignorance ceases choices cease?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{19.14} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{20.1} knowing and seeing thus, do you wield the many kinds of psychic power? …” 

“No,\marginnote{20.2} sir.” 

“Well,\marginnote{21.1} knowing and seeing thus do you, with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far?” 

“No,\marginnote{21.2} sir.” 

“Well,\marginnote{22.1} knowing and seeing thus, do you understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with your mind? …” 

“No,\marginnote{22.4} sir.” 

“Well,\marginnote{23.1} knowing and seeing thus, do you recollect many kinds of past lives, with features and details?” 

“No,\marginnote{23.2} sir.” 

“Well,\marginnote{24.1} knowing and seeing thus, do you, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, see sentient beings passing away and being reborn … according to their deeds?” 

“No,\marginnote{24.2} sir.” 

“Well,\marginnote{25.1} knowing and seeing thus, do you have direct meditative experience of the peaceful liberations that are formless, transcending form?” 

“No,\marginnote{25.2} sir.” 

“Well\marginnote{26.1} now, \textsanskrit{Susīma}, how could there be such a declaration when these things are not attained?” 

Then\marginnote{27.1} Venerable \textsanskrit{Susīma} bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet and said, “I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to go forth as a thief in such a well-explained teaching and training. Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.” 

“Indeed,\marginnote{28.1} \textsanskrit{Susīma}, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to go forth as a thief in such a well-explained teaching and training. Suppose they were to arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to the king, saying: ‘Your Majesty, this is a bandit, a criminal. Punish him as you will.’ The king would say: ‘Go, my men, and tie this man’s arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope. Shave his head and march him from street to street and from square to square to the beating of a harsh drum. Then take him out the south gate and there, to the south of the city, chop off his head.’ The king’s men would do as they were told. What do you think, \textsanskrit{Susīma}? Wouldn’t that man experience pain and distress because of that?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{28.9} sir.” 

“Although\marginnote{29.1} that man would experience pain and distress because of that, going forth as a thief in such a well-explained teaching and training has a more painful and bitter result. And it even leads to the underworld. But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it. For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.”

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts arise for a reason, not without reason. 

And\marginnote{2.1} how do sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts arise for a reason, not without reason? The element of sensuality gives rise to sensual perceptions. Sensual perceptions give rise to sensual thoughts. Sensual thoughts give rise to sensual desires. Sensual desires give rise to sensual passions. Sensual passions give rise to searches for sensual pleasures. An unlearned ordinary person on a search for sensual pleasures behaves badly in three ways: by body, speech, and mind. 

The\marginnote{3.1} element of malice gives rise to malicious perceptions. Malicious perceptions give rise to malicious thoughts. … malicious desires … malicious passions … malicious searches … An unlearned ordinary person on a malicious search behaves badly in three ways: by body, speech, and mind. 

The\marginnote{4.1} element of cruelty gives rise to cruel perceptions. Cruel perceptions give rise to cruel thoughts. … cruel desires … cruel passions … cruel searches … An unlearned ordinary person on a cruel search behaves badly in three ways: by body, speech, and mind.

If they don’t quickly give it up, get rid of it, eliminate it, and obliterate it, they’ll suffer in the present life, with anguish, distress, and fever. And when the body breaks up, after death, they can expect to be reborn in a bad place. 

Thoughts\marginnote{6.1} of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness arise for a reason, not without reason. 

And\marginnote{7.1} how do thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness arise for a reason, not without reason? The element of renunciation gives rise to perceptions of renunciation. Perceptions of renunciation give rise to thoughts of renunciation. Thoughts of renunciation give rise to enthusiasm for renunciation. Enthusiasm for renunciation gives rise to fervor for renunciation. Fervor for renunciation gives rise to the search for renunciation. A learned noble disciple on a search for renunciation behaves well in three ways: by body, speech, and mind. 

The\marginnote{8.1} element of good will gives rise to perceptions of good will. Perceptions of good will give rise to thoughts of good will. … enthusiasm for good will … fervor for good will … the search for good will.

Perceptions of harmlessness give rise to thoughts of harmlessness. … enthusiasm for harmlessness … fervor for harmlessness … the search for harmlessness. A learned noble disciple on a search for harmlessness behaves well in three ways: by body, speech, and mind. 

Suppose\marginnote{10.1} a person was to drop a burning torch in a thicket of dry grass. If they were to quickly extinguish it with their hands and feet, the creatures living in the grass and wood wouldn’t come to ruin. 

In\marginnote{10.2} the same way, a corrupt perception might arise in an ascetic or brahmin.

Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna} was doing likewise, as were Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahākassapa}, Venerable Anuruddha, Venerable \textsanskrit{Puṇṇa} son of \textsanskrit{Mantāṇī}, Venerable \textsanskrit{Upāli}, Venerable Ānanda, and Devadatta. 

Then\marginnote{2.1} the Buddha said to the mendicants, “Mendicants, do you see \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} walking together with several mendicants?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{2.3} sir.” 

“All\marginnote{2.4} of those mendicants have great wisdom. Do you see \textsanskrit{Moggallāna} walking together with several mendicants?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{2.6} sir.” 

“All\marginnote{2.7} of those mendicants have great psychic power. Do you see Kassapa walking together with several mendicants?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{2.9} sir.” 

“All\marginnote{2.10} of those mendicants advocate austerities. Do you see Anuruddha walking together with several mendicants?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{2.12} sir.” 

“All\marginnote{2.13} of those mendicants have clairvoyance. Do you see \textsanskrit{Puṇṇa} son of \textsanskrit{Mantāṇī} walking together with several mendicants?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{2.15} sir.” 

“All\marginnote{2.16} of those mendicants are Dhamma speakers. Do you see \textsanskrit{Upāli} walking together with several mendicants?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{2.18} sir.” 

“All\marginnote{2.19} of those mendicants are experts in monastic law. Do you see Ānanda walking together with several mendicants?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{2.21} sir.” 

“All\marginnote{2.22} of those mendicants are very learned. Do you see Devadatta walking together with several mendicants?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{2.24} sir.” 

“All\marginnote{2.25} of those mendicants have bad desires. 

Sentient\marginnote{3.1} beings come together and converge because of an element. Those who have bad convictions come together and converge with those who have bad convictions. Those who have good convictions come together and converge with those who have good convictions. 

In\marginnote{3.4} the past, in the future, and also in the present, sentient beings come together and converge because of an element. Those who have bad convictions come together and converge with those who have bad convictions. Those who have good convictions come together and converge with those who have good convictions.”

That\marginnote{8.1} is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 

\begin{verse}%
“Socializing\marginnote{9.1} promotes entanglement; \\
they’re cut off by being aloof. \\
If you’re lost in the middle of a great sea, \\
and you clamber up on a little log, you’ll sink. 

So\marginnote{10.1} too, a person who lives well \\
sinks by relying on a lazy person. \\
Hence you should avoid such \\
a lazy person who lacks energy. 

Dwell\marginnote{11.1} with the noble ones \\
who are secluded and determined \\
and always energetic; \\
the astute who practice absorption.”

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” 

“Venerable\marginnote{1.5} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.7} transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving. Suppose a person was to strip all the grass, sticks, branches, and leaves in India, gather them together into one pile, and chop them each into four inch pieces. They’d lay them down, saying: ‘This is my mother, this is my grandmother.’ The grass, sticks, branches, and leaves of India would run out before that person’s mothers and grandmothers. 

Why\marginnote{1.11} is that? Transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving. For such a long time you have undergone suffering, agony, and disaster, swelling the cemeteries.

“If\marginnote{4.1} the bones of a single person \\

they’d make a pile the size of a mountain: \\

Near\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, in the Bamboo Grove. Then thirty mendicants from \textsanskrit{Pāvā} went to the Buddha. All of them lived in the wilderness, ate only almsfood, wore rag robes, and owned just three robes; yet they all still had fetters. They bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. 

Then\marginnote{1.3} it occurred to the Buddha, “These thirty mendicants from \textsanskrit{Pāvā} live in the wilderness, eat only almsfood, wear rag robes, and own just three robes; yet they all still have fetters. Why don’t I teach them the Dhamma in such a way that their minds are freed from defilements by not grasping while sitting in this very seat?”

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.1} transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving. 

What\marginnote{2.3} do you think? Which is more: the flow of blood you’ve shed when your head was chopped off while roaming and transmigrating for such a very long time, or the water in the four oceans?” 

“As\marginnote{2.4} we understand the Buddha’s teaching, the flow of blood we’ve shed when our head was chopped off while roaming and transmigrating is more than the water in the four oceans.” 

“Good,\marginnote{3.1} good, mendicants! It’s good that you understand my teaching like this. The flow of blood you’ve shed when your head was chopped off while roaming and transmigrating is indeed more than the water in the four oceans. For a long time you’ve been cows, and the flow of blood you’ve shed when your head was chopped off as a cow is more than the water in the four oceans. For a long time you’ve been buffalo … rams … goats … deer … chickens … pigs … For a long time you’ve been bandits, arrested for raiding villages, highway robbery, or adultery. And the flow of blood you’ve shed when your head was chopped off as a bandit is more than the water in the four oceans. 

Why\marginnote{3.13} is that? Transmigration has no known beginning. … This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions.” 

That\marginnote{4.1} is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of the thirty mendicants from \textsanskrit{Pāvā} were freed from defilements by not grasping.

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” 

“Venerable\marginnote{1.4} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.1} transmigration has no known beginning. No first point is found of sentient beings roaming and transmigrating, shrouded by ignorance and fettered by craving. Once upon a time, mendicants, this Mount Vepulla was known as \textsanskrit{Pācīnavaṁsa}. And at that time people were known as Tivaras. The lifespan of the Tivaras was 40,000 years. It took them four days to climb Mount Vepulla, and four days to descend. At that time Kakusandha, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world. Kakusandha had a fine pair of chief disciples named Vidhura and \textsanskrit{Sañjīva}. See, mendicants! This mountain’s name has vanished, those people have passed away, and that Buddha has become fully extinguished. So impermanent are conditions, so unstable are conditions, so unreliable are conditions. This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions. 

Once\marginnote{3.1} upon a time this Mount Vepulla was known as \textsanskrit{Vaṅkaka}. And at that time people were known as Rohitassas. The lifespan of the Rohitassas was 30,000 years. It took them three days to climb Mount Vepulla, and three days to descend. At that time \textsanskrit{Koṇāgamana}, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world. \textsanskrit{Koṇāgamana} had a fine pair of chief disciples named Bhiyyosa and Uttara. See, mendicants! This mountain’s name has vanished, those people have passed away, and that Buddha has become fully extinguished. So impermanent are conditions … 

Once\marginnote{4.1} upon a time this Mount Vepulla was known as Supassa. And at that time people were known as Suppiyas. The lifespan of the Suppiyas was 20,000 years. It took them two days to climb Mount Vepulla, and two days to descend. At that time Kassapa, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world. Kassapa had a fine pair of chief disciples named Tissa and \textsanskrit{Bhāradvāja}. See, mendicants! This mountain’s name has vanished, those people have passed away, and that Buddha has become fully extinguished. So impermanent are conditions … 

These\marginnote{5.1} days this Mount Vepulla is known as Vepulla. And these people are known as Magadhans. The lifespan of the Magadhans is short, brief, and fleeting. A long life is a hundred years or a little more. It takes the Magadhans an hour to climb Mount Vepulla, and an hour to descend. And now I am the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha who has arisen in the world. I have a fine pair of chief disciples named \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} and \textsanskrit{Moggallāna}. There will come a time when this mountain’s name will vanish, those people will die, and I will be fully extinguished. So impermanent are conditions, so unstable are conditions, so unreliable are conditions. This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions.” 

That\marginnote{6.1} is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 

\begin{verse}%
“For\marginnote{7.1} the Tivaras it was \textsanskrit{Pācīnavaṁsa}, \\
for the Rohitassa, \textsanskrit{Vaṅkaka}, \\
Supassa for the Suppiyas, \\
and Vepulla for the Magadhans. 

Oh!\marginnote{8.1} Conditions are impermanent, \\
their nature is to rise and fall; \\
having arisen, they cease; \\
their stilling is true bliss.”

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} Kassapa is content with any kind of robe, and praises such contentment. He doesn’t try to get hold of a robe in an improper way. He doesn’t get upset if he doesn’t get a robe. And if he does get a robe, he uses it untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawback, and understanding the escape. 

Kassapa\marginnote{2.1} is content with any kind of almsfood … 

Kassapa\marginnote{3.1} is content with any kind of lodging … 

Kassapa\marginnote{4.1} is content with any kind of medicines and supplies for the sick … 

So\marginnote{5.1} you should train like this: ‘We will be content with any kind of robe, and praise such contentment. We won’t try to get hold of a robe in an improper way. We won’t get upset if we don’t get a robe. And if we do get a robe, we’ll use it untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawback, and understanding the escape.’

‘We\marginnote{6.1} will be content with any kind of almsfood …’ ‘We will be content with any kind of lodging …’ ‘We will be content with any kind of medicines and supplies for the sick …’ That’s how you should train.

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahākassapa} and Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} were staying near Benares, in the deer park at Isipatana. 

Then\marginnote{1.3} in the late afternoon, Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} came out of retreat, went to Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahākassapa}, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to \textsanskrit{Mahākassapa}: 

“Reverend\marginnote{1.5} Kassapa, it’s said that without being keen and prudent you can’t achieve awakening, extinguishment, and the supreme sanctuary. But if you’re keen and prudent you can achieve awakening, extinguishment, and the supreme sanctuary. 

To\marginnote{2.1} what extent is this the case?” 

“Reverend,\marginnote{2.3} take a mendicant who doesn’t foster keenness by thinking: ‘If unarisen unskillful qualities arise in me, they’ll lead to harm.’ ‘If I don’t give up arisen unskillful qualities, they’ll lead to harm.’ ‘If I don’t give rise to unarisen skillful qualities, they’ll lead to harm.’ ‘If arisen skillful qualities cease in me, they’ll lead to harm.’ That’s how you’re not keen. 

And\marginnote{3.1} how are you not prudent? Take a mendicant who doesn’t foster prudence by thinking: ‘If unarisen unskillful qualities arise in me, they’ll lead to harm.’ ‘If I don’t give up arisen unskillful qualities, they’ll lead to harm.’ ‘If I don’t give rise to unarisen skillful qualities, they’ll lead to harm.’ ‘If arisen skillful qualities cease in me, they’ll lead to harm.’ That’s how you’re not prudent. That’s how without being keen and prudent you can’t achieve awakening, extinguishment, and the supreme sanctuary. 

And\marginnote{4.1} how are you keen? Take a mendicant who fosters keenness by thinking: ‘If unarisen unskillful qualities arise in me, they’ll lead to harm.’ ‘If I don’t give up arisen unskillful qualities, they’ll lead to harm.’ ‘If I don’t give rise to unarisen skillful qualities, they’ll lead to harm.’ ‘If arisen skillful qualities cease in me, they’ll lead to harm.’ That’s how you’re keen. 

And\marginnote{5.1} how are you prudent?

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} you should approach families like the moon: withdrawn in body and mind, always the newcomer, and never rude. Suppose a person were to look down at an old well, a rugged cliff, or an inaccessible riverland. They’d withdraw their body and mind. In the same way, you should approach families like the moon: withdrawn in body and mind, always the newcomer, and never rude. 

Kassapa\marginnote{2.1} approaches families like the moon: withdrawn in body and mind, always the newcomer, and never rude. 

What\marginnote{2.3} do you think, mendicants? What kind of mendicant is worthy of approaching families?” 

“Our\marginnote{2.5} teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” 

Then\marginnote{3.1} the Buddha waved his hand in space. 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{3.2} this hand is not stuck or held or caught in space. In the same way, when approaching families, a mendicant’s mind is not stuck or held or caught, thinking: ‘May those who want material possessions get them, and may those who want merit make merits!’ They’re just as pleased and happy when others get something as they are when they get something. This kind of mendicant is worthy of approaching families. 

When\marginnote{4.1} Kassapa approaches families, his mind is not stuck or held or caught, thinking: ‘May those who want material possessions get them, and may those who want merit make merits!’ He’s just as pleased and happy when others get something as he is when he gets something. 

What\marginnote{5.1} do you think, mendicants? What kind of mendicant’s teaching is pure, and what kind is impure?” 

“Our\marginnote{5.3} teachings are rooted in the Buddha. He is our guide and our refuge. Sir, may the Buddha himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” 

“Well\marginnote{5.4} then, mendicants, listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{5.5} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“Whoever\marginnote{6.1} teaches Dhamma to others with the thought: ‘Oh! May they listen to the teaching from me. When they’ve heard it, may they gain confidence in the teaching and demonstrate their confidence to me.’ Such a mendicant’s teaching is impure. 

Whoever\marginnote{7.1} teaches Dhamma to others with the thought: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves. Oh! May they listen to the teaching from me. When they’ve heard it, may they understand the teaching and practice accordingly.’ So they teach others because of the natural excellence of the teaching, out of compassion, kindness, and sympathy. Such a mendicant’s teaching is pure. 

Kassapa\marginnote{8.1} teaches Dhamma to others with the thought: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves. Oh! May they listen to the teaching from me. When they’ve heard it, may they understand the teaching and practice accordingly.’ 

Thus\marginnote{8.4} he teaches others because of the natural excellence of the teaching, out of compassion, kindness, and sympathy. I will exhort you with the example of Kassapa or someone like him. You should practice accordingly.”

“Our\marginnote{1.4} teachings are rooted in the Buddha. …” The Buddha said this: 

“Whoever\marginnote{2.1} visits families with the thought: ‘May they give to me, may they not fail to give. May they give a lot, not a little. May they give me fine things, not coarse. May they give quickly, not slowly. May they give carefully, not carelessly.’ If a mendicant with such a thought approaches a family and they don’t give, the mendicant feels slighted. And they experience pain and sadness because of that. If they give only a little … if they give coarse things … if they give slowly … if they give carelessly, the mendicant feels slighted. And they experience pain and sadness because of that. That kind of mendicant is not worthy of visiting families. 

Whoever\marginnote{3.1} visits families with the thought: ‘When among other families, how could I possibly think:

So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. Near \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, in the Bamboo Grove. Then Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahākassapa} went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 

“You’re\marginnote{1.4} old now, Kassapa. Those worn-out hempen rag robes must be a burden for you. So Kassapa, you should wear clothes given by householders, accept invitations for the meal, and stay in my presence.” 

“For\marginnote{2.1} a long time, sir, I’ve lived in the wilderness, eaten only almsfood, worn rag robes, and owned just three robes; and I’ve praised these things. I’ve been one of few wishes, content, secluded, aloof, and energetic; and I’ve praised these things.” 

“But\marginnote{3.1} seeing what benefit, Kassapa, have you long practiced these things?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{4.1} seeing two benefits I have long practiced these things. 

I\marginnote{5.1} see a happy life for myself in the present. And I have compassion for future generations, thinking: ‘Hopefully those who come after might follow my example.’ For they may think: ‘It seems that the awakened disciples of the Buddha for a long time lived in the wilderness, ate only almsfood, wore rag robes, and owned just three robes; and they praised these things. They were of few wishes, content, secluded, aloof, and energetic; and they praised these things.’ They’ll practice accordingly, which will be for their lasting welfare and happiness. 

Seeing\marginnote{6.1} these two benefits I have long practiced these things.” 

“Good,\marginnote{7.1} good, Kassapa! You’re acting for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans. So Kassapa, wear worn-out hempen rag robes, walk for alms, and stay in the wilderness.”

“Kassapa,\marginnote{1.3} advise the mendicants! Give them a Dhamma talk! Either you or I should advise the mendicants and give them a Dhamma talk.” 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.1} the mendicants these days are hard to admonish, having qualities that make them hard to admonish. They’re impatient, and don’t take instruction respectfully. 

Take\marginnote{2.2} the monk called \textsanskrit{Bhaṇḍa}, Ānanda’s pupil. He’s been competing in studies with the monk called \textsanskrit{Abhiñjika}, Anuruddha’s pupil. They say: ‘Come on, monk, who can recite more? Who can recite better? Who can recite longer?’” 

So\marginnote{3.1} the Buddha addressed a certain monk, “Please, monk, in my name tell the monk called \textsanskrit{Bhaṇḍa}, Ānanda’s pupil, and the monk called \textsanskrit{Abhiñjika}, Anuruddha’s pupil that the teacher summons them.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{3.4} sir,” that monk replied. He went to those monks and said, “Venerables, the teacher summons you.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{4.1} reverend,” those monks replied. They went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to them: 

“Is\marginnote{4.2} it really true, monks, that you’ve been competing in studies, saying: ‘Come on, monk, who can recite more? Who can recite better? Who can recite longer?’” 

“Yes,\marginnote{4.4} sir.” 

“Have\marginnote{4.5} you ever known me to teach the Dhamma like this: ‘Please mendicants, compete in studies to see who can recite more and better and longer’?” 

“No,\marginnote{4.8} sir.” 

“If\marginnote{4.9} you’ve never known me to teach the Dhamma like this, then what exactly do you know and see, you foolish men, that after going forth in such a well explained teaching and training you’d compete in studies to see who can recite more and better and longer?” 

Then\marginnote{5.1} those monks bowed with their heads at the Buddha’s feet and said, “We have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of us in that after going forth in such a well explained teaching and training we competed in studies to see who can recite more and better and longer. Please, sir, accept our mistake for what it is, so we will restrain ourselves in future.” 

“Indeed,\marginnote{6.1} monks, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to act in that way. But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it. For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.”

Whenever\marginnote{9.1} I want, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, I enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling. And so does Kassapa. 

Whenever\marginnote{10.1} I want, I wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying myself and becoming one again; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. I control the body as far as the \textsanskrit{Brahmā} realm. And so does Kassapa. 

Whenever\marginnote{11.1} I want, with clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, I hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far. And so does Kassapa. 

Whenever\marginnote{12.1} I want, I understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with my mind. I understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’, and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’; mind with hate … mind without hate … mind with delusion … mind without delusion … constricted mind … scattered mind … expansive mind … unexpansive mind … mind that is not supreme … mind that is supreme … mind immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi} … mind not immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi} … freed mind … unfreed mind … And so does Kassapa. 

Whenever\marginnote{13.1} I want, I recollect my many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. I remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so I recollect my many kinds of past lives, with features and details. And so does Kassapa. 

Whenever\marginnote{14.1} I want, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. And so does Kassapa. 

I\marginnote{15.1} have realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And I live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements. And so does Kassapa.”

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahākassapa} was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to \textsanskrit{Mahākassapa} and said, “Kassapa, come, sir. Let’s go to one of the nuns’ quarters.” 

“You\marginnote{1.5} go, Reverend Ānanda. You have many duties and responsibilities.” 

And\marginnote{1.6} a second time … 

And\marginnote{1.9} a third time, Ānanda said, “Kassapa, come, sir. Let’s go to one of the nuns’ quarters.” 

Then\marginnote{2.1} Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahākassapa} robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went with Venerable Ānanda as his second monk to one of the nuns’ quarters, where he sat on the seat spread out. And then several nuns went up to \textsanskrit{Mahākassapa}, bowed, and sat down to one side. \textsanskrit{Mahākassapa} educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired those nuns with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. 

But\marginnote{3.1} the nun \textsanskrit{Thullatissā} was upset and blurted out, “What is Master \textsanskrit{Mahākassapa} thinking, that he’d teach Dhamma in front of Master Ānanda, the Videhan sage? He’s like a needle seller who thinks they can sell a needle to a needle maker!” 

\textsanskrit{Mahākassapa}\marginnote{4.1} heard \textsanskrit{Thullatissā} say these words, and he said to Ānanda, “Is that right, Reverend Ānanda? Am I the needle seller and you the needle maker? Or am I the needle maker and you the needle seller?” 

“Forgive\marginnote{4.5} her, sir. The woman’s a fool.” 

“Hold\marginnote{4.6} on, Reverend Ānanda! Don’t make the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} investigate you further! 

What\marginnote{5.1} do you think, Reverend Ānanda? Was it you who the Buddha brought up before the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of mendicants, saying: ‘Mendicants, whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. And so does Ānanda’?” 

“No,\marginnote{5.5} sir.” 

“I\marginnote{6.1} was the one the Buddha brought up before the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of mendicants, saying: ‘Mendicants, whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.

At\marginnote{1.1} one time Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahākassapa} was staying near \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. Now at that time Venerable Ānanda was wandering in the Southern Hills together with a large \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of mendicants. 

And\marginnote{2.1} at that time thirty of Ānanda’s mendicant pupils resigned the training and returned to a lesser life. Most of them were youths. 

When\marginnote{2.2} Venerable Ānanda had wandered in the Southern Hills as long as he wished, he set out for \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, to the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. He went up to Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahākassapa}, bowed, and sat down to one side. \textsanskrit{Mahākassapa} said to him: 

“Reverend\marginnote{2.3} Ānanda, for how many reasons did the Buddha lay down a rule against eating in groups of more than three among families?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{3.1} the Buddha laid down that rule for three reasons. For keeping difficult persons in check and for the comfort of good-hearted mendicants. To prevent those of wicked desires from taking sides and dividing the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}. And out of consideration for families. These are the three reasons why the Buddha laid down that rule.” 

“So\marginnote{4.1} what exactly are you doing, wandering together with these junior mendicants? They don’t guard their sense doors, they eat too much, and they’re not committed to wakefulness. It’s like you’re wandering about wrecking crops and ruining families! Your following is falling apart, Reverend Ānanda, and those just getting started are slipping away. Yet this boy knows no bounds!” 

“Though\marginnote{5.1} there are grey hairs on my head, I still can’t escape being called a boy by Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahākassapa}.” 

“It’s\marginnote{5.3} because you wander with these junior mendicants. … Your following is falling apart, Reverend Ānanda, and those just getting started are slipping away. Yet this boy knows no bounds!” 

The\marginnote{6.1} nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} heard a rumor that Master \textsanskrit{Mahākassapa} had rebuked Master Ānanda the Videhan sage by calling him a boy. 

She\marginnote{7.1} was upset and blurted out, “How can Master \textsanskrit{Mahākassapa}, who formerly followed another path, presume to rebuke Master Ānanda the Videhan sage by calling him a boy?” 

\textsanskrit{Mahākassapa}\marginnote{7.3} heard \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} say these words, and he said to Ānanda, “Indeed, Reverend Ānanda, the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} spoke rashly and without reflection. 

Since\marginnote{8.3} I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness, I don’t recall acknowledging any other teacher apart from the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. 

Formerly\marginnote{8.4} when I was still a layman, I thought: ‘Living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ After some time I made an outer robe of patches and, in the name of the perfected ones in the world, I shaved off my hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. 

When\marginnote{9.1} I had gone forth, I traveled along the road between \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} and \textsanskrit{Nālanda}, where I saw the Buddha sitting at the Bahuputta Shrine. Seeing him, I thought: ‘If I’m ever to see a Teacher, it would be this Blessed One! If I’m ever to see a Holy One, it would be this Blessed One! If I’m ever to see a fully awakened Buddha, it would be this Blessed One!’ 

Then\marginnote{9.7} I bowed with my head at the Buddha’s feet and said: ‘Sir, the Buddha is my Teacher, I am his disciple! The Buddha is my Teacher, I am his disciple!’ 

The\marginnote{9.10} Buddha said to me, ‘Kassapa, if anyone was to say to such a wholehearted disciple that they know when they don’t know, or that they see when they don’t see, their head would explode. But Kassapa, when I say that I know and see I really do know and see. 

So\marginnote{10.1} you should train like this: “I will set up a keen sense of conscience and prudence for seniors, juniors, and those in the middle.” That’s how you should train. 

And\marginnote{11.1} you should train like this: “Whenever I hear a teaching connected with what’s skillful, I will pay heed, pay attention, engage wholeheartedly, and lend an ear to that teaching.” That’s how you should train. 

And\marginnote{12.1} you should train like this: “I will never neglect mindfulness of the body that is full of pleasure.” That’s how you should train.’ 

And\marginnote{13.1} when the Buddha had given me this advice he got up from his seat and left. For seven days I ate the nation’s almsfood as a debtor. On the eighth day I was enlightened. 

And\marginnote{14.1} then the Buddha left the road and went to the root of a certain tree. So I spread out my outer robe of patches folded in four and said to him, ‘Sir, sit here. That would be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’ 

The\marginnote{14.4} Buddha sat on the seat spread out and said to me, ‘Kassapa, this outer robe of patches is soft.’ 

‘Sir,\marginnote{14.7} please accept my outer robe of patches out of compassion.’ 

‘In\marginnote{14.8} that case, Kassapa, will you wear my worn-out hempen rag robe?’ 

‘I\marginnote{14.9} will wear it, sir.’ 

And\marginnote{14.10} so I presented my outer robe of patches to the Buddha, and the Buddha presented me with his worn-out hempen rag robe. 

For\marginnote{15.1} if anyone should be rightly called the Buddha’s true-born child, born from his mouth, born of the teaching, created by the teaching, heir to the teaching, and receiver of his worn-out hempen rag robes, it’s me. 

Whenever\marginnote{16.1} I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. … 

(The\marginnote{16.3} nine progressive meditations and the five insights should be treated in full.) 

I\marginnote{17.1} have realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And I live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements. 

Reverend,\marginnote{17.2} you might as well think to hide a bull elephant that’s three or three and a half meters tall behind a palm leaf as to hide my six insights.” 

But\marginnote{18.1} the nun \textsanskrit{Thullanandā} fell from the spiritual life.

Then\marginnote{1.2} in the late afternoon, Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} came out of retreat, went to Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahākassapa}, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to \textsanskrit{Mahākassapa}: 

“Reverend\marginnote{1.4} Kassapa, does a Realized One exist after death?” 

“Reverend,\marginnote{1.5} this has not been declared by the Buddha.” 

“Well\marginnote{1.7} then, does a Realized One not exist after death?” 

“This\marginnote{1.8} too has not been declared by the Buddha.” 

“Well\marginnote{1.10} then, does a Realized One both exist and not exist after death?”

“Well\marginnote{1.13} then, does a Realized One neither exist nor not exist after death?” 

“This\marginnote{1.14} too has not been declared by the Buddha.” 

“And\marginnote{1.16} why has this not been declared by the Buddha?” 

“Because\marginnote{1.17} it’s not beneficial or relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. It doesn’t lead to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. That’s why it has not been declared by the Buddha.” 

“So\marginnote{2.1} what now has been declared by the Buddha?” “‘This is suffering’ has been declared by the Buddha. ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’ has been declared by the Buddha.” 

“And\marginnote{2.6} why has this been declared by the Buddha?” 

“Because\marginnote{2.7} it’s beneficial and relevant to the fundamentals of the spiritual life. It leads to disillusionment, dispassion, cessation, peace, insight, awakening, and extinguishment. That’s why it has been declared by the Buddha.”

“What\marginnote{1.4} is the cause, sir, what is the reason why there used to be fewer training rules but more enlightened mendicants? And what is the cause, what is the reason why these days there are more training rules and fewer enlightened mendicants?” 

“That’s\marginnote{1.6} how it is, Kassapa. When sentient beings are in decline and the true teaching is disappearing there are more training rules and fewer enlightened mendicants. The true teaching doesn’t disappear as long the counterfeit of the true teaching hasn’t appeared in the world. But when the counterfeit of the true teaching appears in the world then the true teaching disappears. 

It’s\marginnote{2.1} like true gold, which doesn’t disappear as long as counterfeit gold hasn’t appeared in the world. But when counterfeit gold appears in the world then real gold disappears. 

In\marginnote{2.3} the same way, the true teaching doesn’t disappear as long the counterfeit of the true teaching hasn’t appeared in the world. But when the counterfeit of the true teaching appears in the world then the true teaching disappears. 

It’s\marginnote{3.1} not the elements of earth, water, fire, or air that make the true teaching disappear. Rather, it’s the foolish people who appear right here that make the true teaching disappear. The true teaching doesn’t disappear like a ship that sinks all at once. 

There\marginnote{4.1} are five detrimental things that lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching. What five? It’s when the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen lack respect and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}, the training, and immersion. These five detrimental things lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching. 

There\marginnote{5.1} are five things that lead to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching. What five? It’s when the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen maintain respect and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}, the training, and immersion. These five things lead to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching.”

“Possessions,\marginnote{1.2} honor, and popularity are brutal, bitter, and harsh. They’re an obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary. When I’ve comprehended the mind of a certain person, I understand: ‘This venerable would not tell a deliberate lie even for the sake of their father. … 

(To\marginnote{1.5} be expanded as in SN 17.37.) 

brother\marginnote{1.6} … 

sister\marginnote{1.7} … 

son\marginnote{1.8} … 

daughter\marginnote{1.9} … 

wife.’\marginnote{1.10} But some time later I see them tell a deliberate lie because their mind is overcome and overwhelmed by possessions, honor, and popularity. 

So\marginnote{1.12} brutal are possessions, honor, and popularity—bitter and harsh, an obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary. 

So\marginnote{1.13} you should train like this: ‘We will give up arisen possessions, honor, and popularity, and we won’t let them occupy our minds.’ That’s how you should train.”

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. 

Then\marginnote{1.3} Venerable \textsanskrit{Rāhula} went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.” 

“What\marginnote{2.1} do you think, \textsanskrit{Rāhula}? Is the eye permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{2.3} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{2.4} if it’s impermanent, is it suffering or happiness?” 

“Suffering,\marginnote{2.5} sir.” 

“But\marginnote{2.6} if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” 

“No,\marginnote{2.8} sir.” 

“Is\marginnote{3.1} the ear permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{3.2} sir.” … 

“Is\marginnote{3.3} the nose permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{3.4} sir.” … 

“Is\marginnote{3.5} the tongue permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{3.6} sir.” … 

“Is\marginnote{3.7} the body permanent or impermanent?” 

“Impermanent,\marginnote{3.8} sir.” … 

“Is\marginnote{3.9} the mind permanent or impermanent?”

“But\marginnote{3.13} if it’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable, is it fit to be regarded thus: ‘This is mine, I am this, this is my self’?” 

“No,\marginnote{3.15} sir.” 

“Seeing\marginnote{4.1} this, a learned noble disciple grows disillusioned with the eye, the ear, the nose, the tongue, the body, and the mind. Being disillusioned, desire fades away. When desire fades away they’re freed. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. 

They\marginnote{4.3} understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 

Now\marginnote{1.3} at that time Venerable \textsanskrit{Lakkhaṇa} and Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna} were staying on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. Then \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna} robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to \textsanskrit{Lakkhaṇa} and said to him, “Come, Reverend \textsanskrit{Lakkhaṇa}, let’s enter \textsanskrit{Rājagaha} for alms.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.6} reverend,” \textsanskrit{Lakkhaṇa} replied. 

As\marginnote{1.7} \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna} was descending from Vulture’s Peak Mountain he smiled at a certain spot. So \textsanskrit{Lakkhaṇa} said to \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna}, “What is the cause, Reverend \textsanskrit{Moggallāna}, what is the reason you smiled?” 

“Reverend\marginnote{1.10} \textsanskrit{Lakkhaṇa}, it’s the wrong time for this question. Ask me when we’re in the Buddha’s presence.” 

Then\marginnote{2.1} \textsanskrit{Lakkhaṇa} and \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna} wandered for alms in \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}. After the meal, on their return from almsround, they went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. \textsanskrit{Lakkhaṇa} said to \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna}: 

“Just\marginnote{2.2} now, as \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna} was descending from Vulture’s Peak Mountain he smiled at a certain spot. What is the cause, Reverend \textsanskrit{Moggallāna}, what is the reason you smiled?” 

“Just\marginnote{3.1} now, reverend, as I was descending from Vulture’s Peak Mountain I saw a skeleton flying through the air. Vultures, crows, and hawks kept chasing it, pecking, clawing, and stabbing it in the ribs as it screeched in pain. It occurred to me: ‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! That there can be such a sentient being, such an entity, such an incarnation!’” 

Then\marginnote{4.1} the Buddha said to the mendicants: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{4.2} there are disciples who live full of vision and knowledge, since a disciple knows, sees, and witnesses such a thing. 

Formerly,\marginnote{4.4} I too saw that being, but I did not speak of it. For if I had spoken of it others would not have believed me, which would be for their lasting harm and suffering. 

That\marginnote{4.7} being used to be a cattle butcher right here in \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}. As a result of that deed he burned in hell for many years, many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of years. Now he experiences the residual result of that deed in such an incarnation.”

The\marginnote{1.4} mendicants said to him, “Venerable, don’t go to visit families too often.” 

But\marginnote{1.6} that mendicant, when spoken to by the mendicants, said this, “But these senior mendicants think they can go to visit families, so why can’t I?” 

And\marginnote{2.1} then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said: 

“Once\marginnote{3.1} upon a time, mendicants, there was a great lake in the jungle, with bull elephants living nearby. They’d plunge into the lake and pull up lotus bulbs with their trunks. They’d wash them thoroughly until they were free of mud before chewing and swallowing them. That was good for their appearance and health, and wouldn’t result in death or deadly pain. 

The\marginnote{3.5} young cubs, following the example of the great bull elephants, plunged into the lake and pulled up lotus bulbs with their trunks. But they didn’t wash them thoroughly, and while they were still muddy they chewed and swallowed them. That was not good for their appearance and health, and resulted in death or deadly pain. 

In\marginnote{4.1} the same way, there are senior mendicants who robe up in the morning and, taking their bowl and robe, enter the town or village for alms. There they speak on the teachings, and lay people demonstrate their confidence in them. And when they get things, they use them untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawbacks, and understanding the escape. That’s good for their appearance and health, and doesn’t result in death or deadly pain. 

Junior\marginnote{4.6} mendicants, following the example of the senior mendicants, robe up in the morning and, taking their bowl and robe, enter the town or village for alms. There they speak on the teachings, and lay people demonstrate their confidence in them. But when they get things, they use them tied, infatuated, attached, blind to the drawbacks, not understanding the escape. That’s not good for their appearance and health, and results in death or deadly pain. 

So\marginnote{4.11} you should train like this: ‘When we get things, we will use them untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawbacks, and understanding the escape.’ That’s how you should train.”

The\marginnote{1.3} mendicants said to him, “Venerable, don’t socialize with families too often.” 

But\marginnote{1.5} that mendicant, when spoken to by the mendicants, did not stop. 

And\marginnote{1.6} then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. The Buddha said: 

“Once\marginnote{2.1} upon a time, mendicants, a cat was standing by an alley or a drain or a dustbin hunting a little mouse, thinking, ‘When that little mouse comes out to feed, I’ll catch it right there and eat it!’ And then that little mouse came out to feed. The cat caught it and hastily swallowed it without chewing. But that little mouse ate its intestines and mesentery, resulting in death and deadly pain. 

In\marginnote{3.1} the same way, take a certain monk who robes up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, enters the village or town for alms without guarding body, speech, and mind, without establishing mindfulness, and without restraining the sense faculties. There he sees a female scantily clad, with revealing clothes. Lust infects his mind, resulting in death or deadly pain. 

For\marginnote{3.5} it is death in the training of the Noble One to resign the training and return to a lesser life. And it is deadly pain to commit one of the corrupt offenses for which rehabilitation is possible. 

So\marginnote{3.8} you should train like this: ‘We will enter the village or town for alms guarding body, speech, and mind, establishing mindfulness, and restraining the sense faculties.’ That’s how you should train.”

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. There Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna} addressed the mendicants: “Reverends, mendicants!” 

“Reverend,”\marginnote{1.5} they replied. 

Venerable\marginnote{2.1} \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna} said this: 

“Just\marginnote{2.2} now, reverends, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind: ‘They speak of this thing called “noble silence”. What then is this noble silence?’ 

It\marginnote{2.5} occurred to me: ‘As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. This is called noble silence.’ 

And\marginnote{2.8} so, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I was entering and remaining in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. 

While\marginnote{2.9} I was in that meditation, perceptions and attentions accompanied by placing the mind beset me. 

Then\marginnote{3.1} the Buddha came up to me with his psychic power and said, ‘\textsanskrit{Moggallāna}, \textsanskrit{Moggallāna}! Don’t neglect noble silence, brahmin! Settle your mind in noble silence; unify your mind and bring it to immersion in noble silence.’ 

And\marginnote{3.3} so, after some time, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption … 

So\marginnote{3.4} if anyone should be rightly called a disciple who attained to great direct knowledge with help from the Teacher, it’s me.”

“Reverend,”\marginnote{1.4} they replied. \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} said this: 

“Just\marginnote{2.1} now, reverends, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind: ‘Is there anything in the world whose decay and perishing would give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in me?’ It occurred to me: ‘There is nothing in the world whose decay and perishing would give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in me.’” 

When\marginnote{3.1} he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to him, “Even if the Teacher were to decay and perish? Wouldn’t that give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in you?” 

“Even\marginnote{3.3} if the Teacher were to decay and perish, that wouldn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in me. Still, I would think: ‘Alas, the illustrious Teacher, so mighty and powerful, has vanished! If the Buddha was to remain for a long time, that would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.’” 

“That\marginnote{3.6} must be because Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} has long ago totally eradicated ego, possessiveness, and the underlying tendency to conceit. So even if the Teacher were to decay and perish, it wouldn’t give rise to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress in him.”

At\marginnote{1.3} that time Venerables \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} and \textsanskrit{Moggallāna} were staying near \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. Then in the late afternoon, Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} came out of retreat, went to Venerable \textsanskrit{Moggallāna}, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} sat down to one side, and said to \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna}: 

“Reverend\marginnote{2.1} \textsanskrit{Moggallāna}, your faculties are so very clear, and your complexion is pure and bright. Have you spent the day in a peaceful meditation?” 

“Reverend,\marginnote{2.3} I’ve spent the day in a coarse meditation. But I have had some Dhamma talk.” 

“Who\marginnote{2.5} did you have a Dhamma talk with?” 

“With\marginnote{2.6} the Buddha.” 

“But\marginnote{2.7} Reverend, the Buddha is far away. He’s staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. Did you go to him with your psychic power, or did he come to you?” 

“No\marginnote{2.10} reverend, I didn’t go to him with my psychic power, nor did he come to me. Rather, the Buddha cleared his clairvoyance and clairaudience towards me, and I cleared my clairvoyance and clairaudience towards him.” 

“But\marginnote{2.14} what manner of Dhamma talk did you have together?” 

“Well,\marginnote{3.1} reverend, I said to the Buddha, ‘Sir, they speak of one who is energetic. How is an energetic person defined?’ 

When\marginnote{3.4} I said this, the Buddha said, ‘\textsanskrit{Moggallāna}, it’s when a mendicant lives with energy roused up: “Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.” That’s how a person is energetic.’ 

That’s\marginnote{3.8} the Dhamma talk I had together with the Buddha.” 

“Reverend,\marginnote{4.1} next to Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna} I’m like a few pieces of gravel next to the Himalayas, the king of mountains. Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna} is so mighty and powerful he could, if he wished, live on for the eon.” 

“Reverend,\marginnote{5.1} next to Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} I’m like a few grains of salt next to a mound of salt. Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} has been commended, complimented, and praised by the Buddha:

ethics, and peace, \\
any mendicant who has crossed over \\

Now\marginnote{1.2} at that time a certain junior monk, after his meal, on his return from almsround, entered his dwelling, where he adhered to passivity and silence. And he didn’t help the mendicants out when it was time to sew robes. Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. 

So\marginnote{2.1} the Buddha addressed a certain monk, “Please, monk, in my name tell that monk that the Teacher summons him.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{2.3} sir,” that monk replied. He went to that monk and said to him, “Reverend, the teacher summons you.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{2.5} reverend,” that monk replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 

“Is\marginnote{2.6} it really true, monk, that after your meal, on your return from almsround, you entered your dwelling, where you adhered to passivity and silence, and you didn’t help the mendicants out when it was time to sew robes?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.7} I am doing my own work.” 

Then\marginnote{3.1} the Buddha, knowing what that monk was thinking, addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, don’t complain about this monk. This monk gets the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when he wants, without trouble or difficulty. He has realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life, and lives having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.”

Bhikkhu Sujato was born as Anthony Aidan Best on 4/11/1966 in Perth, Western Australia. He grew up in the pleasant suburbs of Mt Lawley and Attadale alongside his sister Nicola, who was the good child. His mother, Margaret Lorraine Huntsman née Pinder, said “he’ll either be a priest or a poet”, while his father, Anthony Thomas Best, advised him to “never do anything for money”. He attended Aquinas College, a Catholic school, where he decided to become an atheist. At the University of WA he studied philosophy, aiming to learn what he wanted to do with his life. Finding that what he wanted to do was play guitar, he dropped out. His main band was named Martha’s Vineyard, which achieved modest success in the indie circuit. Then it broke up, because everyone thought they personally were reason for the success, which, oddly enough, turns out not to have been the case. 

A seemingly random encounter with a roadside joey took him to Thailand, where he entered his first meditation retreat at Wat Ram Poeng, Chieng Mai in 1992. He decided to devote himself to the Buddha’s path, and took full ordination in Wat Pa Nanachat in 1994, where his teachers were Ajahn Pasanno and Ajahn Jayasaro. In 1997 he returned to Perth to study with Ajahn Brahm at Bodhinyana Monastery. 

He spent several years practicing in seclusion in Malaysia and Thailand before establishing Santi Forest Monastery in Bundanoon, NSW, in 2003. There he was instrumental in supporting the establishment of the Theravada bhikkhuni order in Australia and advocating for women’s rights. He continues to teach in Australia and globally, with a special concern for the moral implications of climate change and other forms of environmental destruction. He has published a series of books of original and groundbreaking research on early Buddhism. 

In 2005 he founded SuttaCentral together with Rod Bucknell and John Kelly. In 2015, seeing the need for a complete, accurate, plain English translation of the Pali texts, he undertook the task, spending nearly three years in isolation on the isle of Qi Mei off the coast of the nation of Taiwan. He completed the four main \textsanskrit{Nikāyas} in 2018, and the early books of the Khuddaka \textsanskrit{Nikāya} were complete by 2021. All this work is dedicated to the public domain and is entirely free of copyright encumbrance. 

In 2019 he returned to Sydney where, together with Bhikkhu Akaliko, he established Lokanta Vihara (The Monastery at the End of the World). 

\section*{Creation Process}

Primary source was the digital \textsanskrit{Mahāsaṅgīti} edition of the Pali \textsanskrit{Tipiṭaka}. Translated from the Pali, with reference to several English translations, especially those of Bhikkhu Bodhi.

\section*{The Translation}

This translation was part of a project to translate the four Pali \textsanskrit{Nikāyas} with the following aims: plain, approachable English; consistent terminology; accurate rendition of the Pali; free of copyright. It was made during 2016–2018 while Bhikkhu Sujato was staying in Qimei, Taiwan.

\section*{About SuttaCentral}

SuttaCentral publishes early Buddhist texts. Since 2005 we have provided root texts in Pali, Chinese, Sanskrit, Tibetan, and other languages, parallels between these texts, and translations in many modern languages. We build on the work of generations of scholars, and offer our contribution freely.

SuttaCentral is driven by volunteer contributions, and in addition we employ professional developers. We offer a sponsorship program for high quality translations from the original languages. Financial support for SuttaCentral is handled by the SuttaCentral Development Trust, a charitable trust registered in Australia.

Bilara is a web app that enables translators to translate early Buddhist texts into their own language. These translations are published on SuttaCentral with the root text and translation side by side.
