Since 2005 SuttaCentral has provided access to the texts, translations, and parallels of early Buddhist texts. In 2018 we started creating and publishing our translations of these seminal spiritual classics. The “Editions” series now makes selected translations available as books in various forms, including print, PDF, and EPUB.

Editions are selected from our most complete, well-crafted, and reliable translations. They aim to bring these texts to a wider audience in forms that reward mindful reading. Care is taken with every detail of the production, and we aim to meet or exceed professional best standards in every way. These are the core scriptures underlying the entire Buddhist tradition, and we believe that they deserve to be preserved and made available in the highest quality without compromise.

SuttaCentral is a charitable organization. Our work is accomplished by volunteers and through the generosity of our donors. Everything we create is offered to all of humanity free of any copyright or licensing restrictions.

For the slightest of the early Buddhist books, I feel I should write a slight preface. There is beauty in simplicity and strength in humility. Spiritual teachings need not always tell us something new, nor need they dazzle us with complicated philosophy or intricate arguments. Sometimes the most powerful lesson is that which you have always known.

It is a discomforting thought, but when I think of those who most effortlessly embody the Buddha’s teachings, it is rarely those who have mastered the scriptures or who debate the meaning of abstruse points. It is in the simple offering, the quiet devotion, the humble wisdom, the unnoticed kindness that I see the flowering of grace.

To be all that we can be is to be less than we have become. If all that the suttas did was to fill us with information, they would be as useful as an ancient Wikipedia (which would be no bad thing). The real wisdom of the suttas, I have come to learn, lies in their delicate balance: saying what need be said and not saying what need not be said.

A full meal is best enjoyed on an empty stomach. And the suttas will fill our minds and hearts, but only if we respect their empty spaces.

\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{So It Was Said: summary sayings}

\scbyline{Bhikkhu Sujato, 2022}

The Itivuttaka or “So it Was Said” is the fourth book of the Pali Khuddhaka \textsanskrit{Nikāya}, the “Minor Collection”. It is a short book, with 112 discourses in mixed prose and verse.  The teachings in the Itivuttaka are by and large straightforward, as is the style of both prose and verse.

The text is arranged in the \textsanskrit{Aṅguttara} style of incremental numbering, which here goes from the Ones through Fours. Within each of these major sections, the texts are rather arbitrarily divided into chapters (\emph{vagga}) of ten. The exceptions are the concluding chapters of the Ones, Twos, and Fours, which contain 7, 12, and 13 discourses respectively.

\section*{The Chinese Collection of Itivuttakas}

As with most of the early texts in the Pali Canon, there exists a corresponding Chinese version: \langlzh{本事經} (Taishō vol. 17, sutra 765), which was translated by Xuanzang in CE 650. This was studied by K. Watanabe in his \textit{A Chinese Collection of Itivuttakas} (Journal of the Pali Text Society V, 1906–7, pp. 44–49).

The Chinese text contains framing statements that are similar to the Pali, except the final statement is omitted. This is, I think, a significant detail, to which I will return below.

While the first two sections are similar to the Pali, three-fifths of the third and all of the fourth sections are missing. That this is the result of an incomplete text, rather than a shorter recension, is supported by two details. The text lacks a concluding \emph{\textsanskrit{uddāna}}, the summary verse or “resumé” that is normally found at the end of every section. And the content of the Suttas, while remaining within the scope of the early Buddhist teachings, is somewhat developed compared to the Pali. It seems, then, that the Chinese text represents an incomplete text of a somewhat later version of an Itivuttaka.

It is not clear why a scholar as able as Xuanzang would leave the work incomplete. Perhaps he had only a partial manuscript to work with, or perhaps it was simply that other demands took his time. In the introduction to his translation of the Itivuttaka, Ven. \textsanskrit{Ṭhānissaro} remarks that Xuanzang’s translation “dates from the last months of his life”. This is mistaken and apparently caused by a misreading of Watanabe’s article. Xuanzang did not die until fourteen years later, in 664.

\section*{The Formation of the Itivuttaka}

Each Sutta is introduced with a distinct phrase saying the text was “said” (\emph{vutta}) by the Buddha, and it appears that this tag is what gives the collection its name. The tag is more than just an introduction; it is a full template that frames each discourse.

\begin{itemize}%
\item Start the prose — \emph{This was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard.}%
\item End the prose — \emph{The Buddha spoke this matter.}%
\item Start the verse — \emph{On this it is said:}%
\item End the verse — \emph{This too is a matter that was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.}%
\end{itemize}

This framework, more formalized and consistent than the standard forms, is adhered to rigorously throughout without variation.

Note that the tag lines assume that the verse comments on the prose (\emph{tattha}). Note too that here, as in the \textsanskrit{Udāna}, \emph{attha} has the sense “matter, substance, content” rather than “meaning”.

The opening compound, \emph{\textsanskrit{vuttañhetaṁ}} contains the particle \emph{hi}, which most translators ignore, but which Masefield perhaps over-renders as “unquestionably”. This exact idiom is not used elsewhere in the early texts, but it is quite common in the Niddesa, where it seems to act as a logical connection. A doctrine is stated, and it is supported with additional quotations. Perhaps then we should translate, “For this was said by the Buddha …”.

Unusually, there is no mention of the setting or other background details. Additionally, there are few personal names in the text. Apart from the Buddha, who is referred to by many epithets, only the Buddha’s antagonists Devadatta (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti89/en/sujato}{Iti 89}) and \textsanskrit{Māra} (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti58/en/sujato}{Iti 58}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti68/en/sujato}{Iti 68}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti82/en/sujato}{Iti 82}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti83/en/sujato}{Iti 83}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti93/en/sujato}{Iti 93}) are mentioned by name. As for places, only the Vulture’s Peak in \textsanskrit{Rāgaha} is mentioned (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti24/en/sujato}{Iti 24}). All this adds up to an oddly abstracted and spare text, almost Abhidhammic in style. It suggests that the collection was compiled from reports of what the Buddha said rather than from first-hand recollections.

This is, in fact, the position of the commentary, which explains that the Itivuttaka, alone among the texts of the Pali canon, was not compiled primarily by the monks, but by the laywoman \textsanskrit{Khujjuttarā}. In the \textsanskrit{Aṅguttara} \textsanskrit{Nikāya}, she was extolled by the Buddha as the foremost in learning among the laywomen and is frequently held up as an exemplary laywoman. While the Suttas do not say how she earned that title, the commentary tells of how, as handmaid to Queen \textsanskrit{Sāmāvatī} of Kosambi, she became the respected teacher of Dhamma for the ladies of the court. This story is only part of a much longer and very dramatic series of events known as the Kosambi Cycle.

It seems that the Queen entrusted her with procuring flowers for the court, but she would save some of the money each day. One day, she overheard the Buddha teaching the Dhamma to the gardener Sumana and right away entered the stream. In celebration, she spent her saved money on flowers, prompting the queen to ask where they all came from. And when \textsanskrit{Khujjuttarā} told her, the queen showered her with honors, bathed her in perfumed water, and became her student. \textsanskrit{Khujjuttarā} continued to listen and memorize the Dhamma from the Buddha and would convey it to all the court ladies, who became stream-enterers in turn. These teachings were compiled into the Itivuttaka, which is why they do not have the usual prose opening formula.

It is difficult to reconcile this story with the Itivuttaka as it stands. The texts are clearly organized in a pattern of numbers from one to four, and it seems improbable that \textsanskrit{Khujjuttarā} just happened to hear texts that would be amenable to such an arrangement. It could be that she did hear many more teachings, but selected certain texts and arranged them for the ladies of the court. However, there is no special emphasis on teachings suitable for court ladies, and several quite difficult texts that would be hard to make sense of without a broader context.

On the other hand, there seems no reason why the monks would invent such a story, which sidelines their role in the creation of this text, and ascribes it instead to the elevated slave of a doomed dynasty. As so often in such matters, we are left without definite conclusions. The absence of certainty does not, however, imply the presence of ignorance. In such matters, it is usually the case that there is something to the stories; they are rarely fabricated out of thin air. We should not reject knowledge simply because it is unconfirmed or hard to understand. The truth is surely more complicated than we know. Yet if we were to abandon our few clues because they are not as certain as we would like, we would be like someone who, lost in the darkness with only a candle to light the way, blows out the candle because it is not a torch.

A text called Itivuttaka is mentioned in the list of the nine \emph{\textsanskrit{aṅgas}} (sections) of the Dhamma that is found throughout the early texts. And as with so many of the \emph{\textsanskrit{aṅgas}}, it is not easy to determine the extent to which the Itivuttaka as it exists today is the same text referred to as an \emph{\textsanskrit{aṅga}}.

Normally the \emph{\textsanskrit{aṅgas}} define a genre of text with an identifiable style. If, however, we accept the Theravadin account, the Itivuttaka is unusual in that there is no intrinsic relationship between the name of the \emph{\textsanskrit{aṅga}} and the style of text. The discourses are, leaving the unique framing aside, essentially no different from those found in the \textsanskrit{Aṅguttara}. Perhaps, like most \emph{\textsanskrit{aṅgas}}, \emph{itivuttaka} originally referred to a distinct genre of early Buddhist literature.

The name itself is perhaps misleadingly malleable. By that I mean that it compounds two very common words (\emph{iti} “thus” and \emph{vutta} “spoke”) and hence may be applied very generally. However, in idiomatic usage, the terms have a more specific and stronger sense: something that is quoted or passed down from the past. The name is reminiscent of the class of Vedic literature called \emph{\textsanskrit{itihāsa}}, “Thus It Was”, i.e. “stories of the past, legendary histories”, which is sometimes equated with the \textsanskrit{Mahābhārata} and the \textsanskrit{Ramāyana}. Similarly, \emph{\textsanskrit{itikirā}} “So It Seems”, though sometimes translated as “hearsay”, is grouped with words referring to the transmission of texts, and must mean something like “testament”. We also find \emph{\textsanskrit{itihītiha}} “So and So It Was” used of knowledge that has been passed down from the past.

By analogy, \emph{itivuttaka} would mean “sayings of the past”, which could refer to the legendary histories that are found in the \textsanskrit{Nikāyas}, such as the \textsanskrit{Aggaññasutta} (\href{https://suttacentral.net/dn27/en/sujato}{DN 27}) and the \textsanskrit{Cakkavattisīhanādasutta} (\href{https://suttacentral.net/dn26/en/sujato}{DN 26}), as well as legendary lore such as the 32 marks of the great man, or the occasional sayings reported to have been passed down from teachers of old (eg. \href{https://suttacentral.net/mn75/en/sujato\#19.11}{MN 75:19.11}). This theory finds support from the great \textsanskrit{Mahāyāna} commentator \textsanskrit{Asaṅga}, who in his Abhidharmasamuccaya says \emph{itivuttaka} “narrates the former existences of the noble disciples”, while in the \textsanskrit{Śrāvakabhūmi} of the \textsanskrit{Yogacārabhūmiśāstra}, he says it refers to “whatever is connected with previous practice”.

Still further support may be adduced in that part of the framing tags of the Itivuttaka—specifically, those that connect the prose and verse—are found in one other text of the Pali canon in nearly identical form (lacking only a connecting \emph{iti}: \emph{\textsanskrit{tatthetaṁ} vuccati} rather than \emph{\textsanskrit{tatthetaṁ} iti vuccati}). This is in \href{https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato}{DN 30} \textsanskrit{Mahāpurisalakkhaṇasutta}, an extended elaboration of the so-called “marks of the great man”, which are said in the Suttas to be traditional lore handed down among the brahmins. The verses especially are among the latest additions to the four \textsanskrit{Nikāyas}, and in this case, it is clear that the tagline serves to add verses to a pre-existing prose text. The commentary says that some “elders of old” explain \emph{\textsanskrit{tatthetaṁ} vuccati} as indicating that the verses were added by Ānanda.

If this reasoning is cogent, then it seems that \emph{itivuttaka} originally referred to the various legendary accounts that are currently scattered in the four \textsanskrit{Nikāyas}. At some point—the First Council, perhaps—the material organized in the nine  \emph{\textsanskrit{aṅgas}} was rearranged for the convenience of memorization into the \textsanskrit{Nikāyas}. With the legendary texts absorbed in the \textsanskrit{Nikāyas}, the name \emph{itivuttaka} was floating unused and was adopted to frame this small selection of \textsanskrit{Aṅguttara} style texts.

If this is true it may be easily reconciled with the traditional account. There is no reason why, if the collection as we have it is due to \textsanskrit{Khujjuttarā}, it should not have been titled Itivuttaka at a later date. All this is, of course, speculative.

\section*{The Purpose of the Itivuttaka}

Given its minor position within the Pali Canon, it is probably safe to assume that most modern readers will pick up the Itivuttaka when already familiar with the Suttas from the \textsanskrit{Nikāyas}. It may be that this is the wrong approach.

The text begins with a series of teachings on the “one thing” that must be given up. To read a series of multiple “one things” is a bit odd. Are they all “one thing”? What is the relation between them? Does any one of these imply all the rest? The text begins by speaking of realizing “non-return”, assuming the audience already knows what this is and wants to attain it.

Take the first discourse: the one thing to be given up is greed. As a reader, this discourse can be skimmed in a couple of minutes, and it provides no new information or perspective. But perhaps that is not its purpose. Perhaps the text was meant to be approached as a meditation structured for those who are familiar with the basics and are undertaking the process of internalizing the theory.

One could learn just this one discourse and take it as a theme for meditation. Focus only on greed, and how it drags the mind to unworthy places. The \emph{idea} is simple, but to truly digest it can be long and complex work. By giving only the simplest of outlines, the text leaves the details to the individual, who is left to explore their relation to greed.

Such a process might take days, weeks, or months. But conservatively, one might take such a short discourse as the theme of contemplation for a day. The next day it is not greed, but hate. The details, differences, and relations between greed and hate are not spelled out; they are realized by the meditator, informed by their prior study and experience.

And so on through the different qualities. Then the round repeats with a slight variation. Then new topics are introduced, each one a self-contained reflection.

I can’t prove that this is why the Itivuttaka is the way it is, but I do think this offers a promising way of approaching the text.

\section*{Relation Between Prose and Verse}

Unlike the \textsanskrit{Udāna}, where the verse is the culminating purpose of the narrative, here the verses serve to repeat and amplify the prose teachings, again in a style similar to certain portions of the \textsanskrit{Aṅguttara}. In line with the systematic tendency of the Itivuttaka, this pattern occurs in all Suttas.

The framing text asserts that both prose and verse portions were spoken by the Buddha. However, it is careful to qualify this by saying “so I have heard”, indicating that the speaker was not present when the teachings were given, but rather is passing down an oral tradition. It is quite possible that this is correct, and that both prose and verse were spoken in this form by the Buddha. However, there are several indications that this is not always the case.

It is quite common for Buddhist texts to have verse and prose portions that are loosely coupled. Sometimes the same verse has a different prose background. Sometimes the connection between the two seems distant or arbitrary. Sometimes the texts attribute the different portions to different authors. So it would be no great surprise for the Itivuttaka to follow a similar pattern.

A fruitful approach is to look at the implicit speaker in the text, rather than the speaker assigned by the framework. Now, the framing portions must have been added by redactors at some point, possibly the First Council. They are in the third person, reporting what the Buddha said.

In the prose teaching portions, by contrast, the Buddha refers to himself in the first person (eg. \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti14/en/sujato}{Iti 14} \emph{\textsanskrit{ahaṁ}}; \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti103/en/sujato}{Iti 103} \emph{na me te}). Appropriately, he addresses the mendicants in the second person (eg. \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti22/en/sujato}{Iti 22} \emph{\textsanskrit{mā}, bhikkhave, \textsanskrit{puññānaṁ} \textsanskrit{bhāyittha}}; \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti38/en/sujato}{Iti 38} \emph{tumhepi \textsanskrit{abyāpajjhārāmā} viharatha}; \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti111/en/sujato}{Iti 111} \emph{\textsanskrit{sampannasīlā}, bhikkhave, viharatha}). I’m setting aside here the vocative form of direct address found in every Sutta (\emph{bhikkhave}), as this could be regarded as a mere convention.

In the verses, however, we typically find the third person used for both the Buddha and the mendicants, in a manner that is more similar to the framing portions.

For example, in \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti26/en/sujato}{Iti 26} the prose is in the first person “as I understand” \emph{\textsanskrit{yathāhaṁ} \textsanskrit{jānāmi}}, while the verse reports the words of the Buddha, “as taught by the great hermit” (\emph{\textsanskrit{yathāvuttaṁ} \textsanskrit{mahesinā}}). Not only is this in the third person, but the passive instrumental construction is identical to that used in the frame (\emph{vutto \textsanskrit{bhagavatā}}). The Buddha is also referred to in the third person in a similar way in \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti36/en/sujato}{Iti 36} (\emph{adesayi so \textsanskrit{bhagavā}}, \emph{\textsanskrit{yathā} buddhena \textsanskrit{desitaṁ}}).

In \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti85/en/sujato}{Iti 85} the mendicants are addressed in the second person in the prose (\emph{viharatha}), but the third person is used in the verse (\emph{vimuccati}).

In \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti70/en/sujato}{Iti 70}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti71/en/sujato}{Iti 71}, and \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti81/en/sujato}{Iti 81} the Buddha speaks of how good and bad kamma results in good or bad rebirths, insisting that this is something that he has seen for himself (\emph{\textsanskrit{diṭṭhā} \textsanskrit{mayā}}), and has not learned from any other ascetic or brahmin. The verses again are in the third person.

\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti92/en/sujato}{Iti 92} has one of the Itivuttaka’s rare moments of intimacy. The Buddha speaks of a poorly-behaved mendicant who might follow him around holding the corner of his robe, yet they remain “far from me, and I from them” (\emph{\textsanskrit{ārakāva} \textsanskrit{mayhaṁ}, \textsanskrit{ahañca} tassa}). This is unlike one who has well-practiced the Dhamma, to whom the Buddha is always close. The verses once more avoid the personal touch here. The same pattern holds for \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti100/en/sujato}{Iti 100}, where the Buddha says to his students that “you are my children” (\emph{me tumhe \textsanskrit{puttā}}); and in \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti107/en/sujato}{Iti 107} where the mendicants are enjoined to be grateful for the things that the lay folk offer “to you”, while in both cases the verses shift to the more distant third person.

Rarely in the analysis of ancient texts do we find that a pattern admits of no exceptions. It is true, admittedly, that the prose text sometimes has the Buddha referring to himself in the third person as the “Realized One” (eg. \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti38/en/sujato}{Iti 38}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti39/en/sujato}{Iti 39}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti84/en/sujato}{Iti 84}). But this is a common feature of prose Suttas. The Buddha speaks in this way when evoking the profound nature of his state of transcendent realization (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti112/en/sujato}{Iti 112}).

In \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti47/en/sujato}{Iti 47} the verses are in a direct second person. This, however, turns out to be the exception that proves the rule, for the subject here is wakefulness. The text is designed to jolt awake the sleepy, so the direct address of the second person is called for. Amid the almost brutalist plainness of the Itivuttaka, this qualifies as a flourish of literary style.

A further exception is in \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti99/en/sujato}{Iti 99}, where both the prose and verse employ the first person. The verses are not unique to this Sutta, however, for they are found in a similar context in \href{https://suttacentral.net/an3.58/en/sujato}{AN 3.58} and \href{https://suttacentral.net/an3.59/en/sujato}{AN 3.59}. There, the Buddha is responding to a brahmin who challenges him on the true meaning of a “brahmin who is master of the three knowledges”. The brahmin defines this in terms of knowing the Vedic literary tradition, while the Buddha redefines it, as always, in terms of the gradual training and the realization of the three higher knowledges. The text of the Itivuttaka reads like the \textsanskrit{Aṅguttara} texts with the narrative removed and has probably been adapted from there. This is an interesting case because it agrees very nicely with the traditional origin story of the Itivuttaka. A text with a narrative context has been repeated in a slightly adapted and stripped-down form, taking a step towards an almost Abhidhammic plainness.

Finally, in two further Suttas we find the first person \emph{\textsanskrit{brūmi}} “I say” used in verse (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti38/en/sujato\#7.5}{Iti 38:7.5}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti46/en/sujato\#3.4}{Iti 46:3.4}). These lines are unique to the Itivuttaka, so they constitute a genuine exception to the rule.

In sum, there is a strong tendency for the prose sections to be presented as the Buddha speaking directly to the monks, while the verses read as a third-hand rephrasing of the same teachings, sometimes summarizing or expanding. The few occasions where this pattern does not hold are mostly explained by the specific context. This pattern suggests that, on the whole, the prose portions are relatively direct reports of the Buddha’s words, while the verses were added by redactors.

I noted above that the Chinese version, though otherwise appearing somewhat more developed than the Pali, lacks the final tag phrase of the frame (\emph{ayampi attho vutto \textsanskrit{bhagavatā}}). It is in this line that the Pali text asserts that the verses were spoken by the Buddha. The tag phrase that starts the verses says simply “on this it is said” (\emph{\textsanskrit{tatthetaṁ} iti vuccati}), which might easily refer to an addition made by redactors. Recall that a nearly-identical tag is used in \href{https://suttacentral.net/dn30/en/sujato}{DN 30} where it indicates a later addition.

This provides, I think, concrete support for the conclusion that the verses are for the most part a later addition to the prose. Originally they were simply presented as such, but at some point, the redactors claimed that, like the prose, the verses were “also” (\emph{pi}) spoken by the Buddha. As we have seen, they were not entirely wrong, for some of the verses do present as the direct words of the Buddha. And in many other cases, there is no real evidence either way.

A case like this is not so much an attempt to misrepresent the material as it is an outcome of a process of systematization. Material from diverse sources is flattened and simplified, and certain nuances get lost along the way. The Theravada tradition is usually very scrupulous about such details, and less inclined to adapt older texts to later needs. Yet this case proves the exception, as the northern—possibly \textsanskrit{Sarvāstivādin}—text retains a clue to an earlier form.

\section*{Similes}

Moore, in the introduction to his 1908 translation, counts a round fifty similes in the Itivuttaka, and the following is based on his analysis. Nature provides most of the similes, starting with water in its many forms.

Water is a decidedly ambiguous element in the Itivuttaka. It often figures in powerfully negative ways. The realm of desire and suffering is called a flood (\emph{ogha}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti107/en/sujato}{Iti 107}), an ocean (\emph{samudda}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti69/en/sujato}{Iti 69}), a river (\emph{\textsanskrit{nadī}}) or a stream, (\emph{sota}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti109/en/sujato}{Iti 109}), or even a treacherous whirlpool (\emph{\textsanskrit{āvaṭṭa}}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti109/en/sujato\#7.1}{Iti 109:7.1}). A perfected one crosses (\emph{tarati}, occurring about a dozen times) beyond all these, going to the far side (\emph{\textsanskrit{pāra}}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti69/en/sujato\#2.4}{Iti 69:2.4}).

On the other hand, the bursting of a rain cloud is like one whose generosity covers all quarters (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti75/en/sujato}{Iti 75}), while one who understands the Dhamma is like a still lake unruffled by the winds (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti92/en/sujato}{Iti 92}).

Metaphors based upon light are almost as numerous as the aqueous metaphors, but unlike the water’s ambiguity, they are invariably positive, contrasting with the darkness of ignorance. The awakened mendicants are the “torch-bearers” for those still in darkness (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti104/en/sujato\#2.9}{Iti 104:2.9}).  Of the heavenly bodies, we find the sun (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti59/en/sujato\#3.4}{Iti 59:3.4}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti88/en/sujato\#11.4}{Iti 88:11.4}), the moon (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti27/en/sujato\#9.3}{Iti 27:9.3}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti74/en/sujato\#7.5}{Iti 74:7.5}), and the morning-star, (\emph{osadhitaraka}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti27/en/sujato\#5.1}{Iti 27:5.1}) as images of wisdom and freedom.

Fire, like water, is often negative. The impressive and relatively modern technology of smelting iron, based on the capacity to focus and amplify heat beyond anything experienced in nature, provides a suitable metaphor for the fate awaiting evildoers in hell (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti48/en/sujato\#5.1}{Iti 48:5.1}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti91/en/sujato\#5.1}{Iti 91:5.1}).

The highest goal of \textsanskrit{Nibbāna}, of course, is the quenching or extinguishment of a flame, the fundamental image of all Buddhism. One who has attained such is far from those who are still burning (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti92/en/sujato\#4.4}{Iti 92:4.4}).

Ambiguously, Devadatta before his fall had glory that shone forth like the crest of a flame (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti89/en/sujato\#4.3)}{Iti 89:4.3}).

Despite its rather austere style, at times the Itivuttaka builds images in a way that accumulates beauty. A gentle series of similes describes one who can let go of greed, like the water that rolls off a lotus leaf; hate, like a palm-leaf falling from its stem; and delusion, like the rising sun banishing the dark (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti88/en/sujato}{Iti 88}).

Few animals are mentioned in the Itivuttaka, but of those that are we find a man who wraps stinky fish (\emph{maccha}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti76/en/sujato\#7.1}{Iti 76:7.1}); and the Buddha compared to a lion (\emph{\textsanskrit{sīha}}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti112/en/sujato\#10.2}{Iti 112:10.2}).

One who enters the water is at risk of being devoured by the saltwater crocodile (\emph{gaha}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti69/en/sujato\#2.2}{Iti 69:2.2}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti109/en/sujato\#2.3}{Iti 109:2.3}). Science tells us that seven species of crocodile flourished in ancient India, sadly reduced to three in the present day. Pali offers us at least five words for these: \emph{\textsanskrit{suṁsumārā}}, \emph{\textsanskrit{susukā}}, \emph{nakka}, \emph{gaha} (\emph{\textsanskrit{gāha}},  \emph{gahaka}), and \emph{\textsanskrit{kumbhīlā}}. It is not clear which words apply to which species, or even if they correlate to different species at all. Only the \emph{gaha} appears in the Itivuttaka, and it notably is a denizen of both oceans and large lakes, so I think it must be a saltwater crocodile. Since the  \emph{\textsanskrit{kumbhīlā}} and \emph{\textsanskrit{susukā}} do not appear to inhabit the ocean, I call them “marsh crocodiles” and “gharials” respectively, while \emph{\textsanskrit{suṁsumārā}} is generically a “crocodile”.

There is, I believe, an implicit metaphor in the term \emph{\textsanskrit{siṅgī}}, “fraud”, that is applied to a bad monk in \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti108/en/sujato}{Iti 108}. This is a word for either “horn” or “gold”. I believe the latter is meant here, for there are hints that the kind of gold meant is adulterated, perhaps a form of rose gold admixed with copper to form jewelry. The robes accepted by the Buddha shortly before his \textsanskrit{Parinibbāna} are this color, where they are meant to contrast palely with the true gold of the Buddha’s skin. I think \emph{\textsanskrit{siṅgī}} became an idiomatic term for “false gold” and hence a bad monk.

A few miscellaneous similes are worthy of note. The poisoned arrow that contaminates its quiver (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti76/en/sujato}{Iti 76}) is like a bad person who infects those around them. The striking image occurs of the conduit to rebirth (\emph{netti}, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti43/en/sujato\#4.1}{Iti 43:4.1}), psychologically explained as craving, but metaphorically evocative of a line or a link that leads from one life to the next. Finally, the piling up of a person’s bones in their countless rebirths would reach higher than the great mountain of Vulture Peak (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti24/en/sujato}{Iti 24}).

\section*{A Few Remarks on the Discourses}

\subsection*{The Ones}

The first chapter begins with a series of teachings on the “one thing”. This follows the pattern of the \textsanskrit{Aṅguttara}, although the specifics are different. Rather than opening with the overcoming of sensual desire, here we begin with what must be given up to guarantee non-return. This is the third of the four stages of awakening commonly taught in the Buddhist texts:

\begin{itemize}%
\item Stream-entry (\emph{\textsanskrit{sotāpatti}})%
\item Once-return (\emph{\textsanskrit{sakadāgāmitā}})%
\item Non-return (\emph{\textsanskrit{anāgāmitā}})%
\item Perfection (\emph{\textsanskrit{arahattā}})%
\end{itemize}

The qualities spoken of, however, don’t always sit easily with this ideal. A non-returner has given up greed (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti1/en/sujato}{Iti 1}) and hate (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti2/en/sujato}{Iti 2}), but they have not given up delusion (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti3/en/sujato}{Iti 3}) or conceit (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti6/en/sujato}{Iti 6}). Perhaps the text has been overly systematized since these details are repeated in the next section where they fit better. But this is the kind of detail that the Pali texts are normally very careful with.

The next series graduates from non-return to speak of ending suffering through complete understanding, which implies arahantship. This pattern crosses over the boundary of the second chapter, which suggests that the texts were grouped before being somewhat arbitrarily organized in groups of ten. Likewise, the pair on the “corrupted mind” (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti20/en/sujato}{Iti 20}) and “pure mind” (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti21/en/sujato}{Iti 21}) also cross the chapter boundary. Again, we find a similar phenomenon in the \textsanskrit{Aṅguttara}, where for example the discourses on the radiant or corrupted mind (\href{https://suttacentral.net/1.49/en/sujato}{1.49}–52) cross the boundary of the fifth and sixth chapters.

These details are not very important in themselves, but they do indicate the struggles of the redactors to formalize the organization of texts. If we are alert to these issues, we guard against reading undue significance into mere editorial choices.

The benefits of the meditation on love are extolled in (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti22/en/sujato}{Iti 22}), which details some of the Buddha’s past life practices, and (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti27/en/sujato}{Iti 27}), which is adorned by a series of glorious metaphors. This relatively extended and exalted text forms a suitable conclusion to the first part of the book. This pattern repeats throughout the Itivuttaka, as the final discourse of each of the numbers deals with deep matters in a solemn tone.

\subsection*{The Twos}

Continuing a similar approach, the second chapter speaks of sets of “two things” that lead to happiness or suffering, or else practices that lead to one of two good results.

In a break from the practical ethics of most of the Itivuttaka, \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti43/en/sujato}{Iti 43} speaks of \textsanskrit{Nibbāna} as the “unborn”, in a passage shared with \href{https://suttacentral.net/ud8.3/en/sujato}{Ud 8.3}. Here an extra set of verses is added, adding to the impression that the Itivuttaka is compiled from earlier texts, sometimes with additions.

In \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti44/en/sujato}{Iti 44} we find one of the few distinct doctrinal contributions of the Itivuttaka. It introduces the distinction between “the element of extinguishment with something left over” (\emph{\textsanskrit{saupādisesā} ca \textsanskrit{nibbānadhātu}}) and “the element of extinguishment with nothing left over” (\emph{\textsanskrit{anupādisesā} ca \textsanskrit{nibbānadhātu}}). The first refers to an arahant who has abandoned all defilements, yet who continues to live and experience pleasure and pain. The second refers to an arahant for whom “everything that’s felt, being no longer relished, will become cool right here”. This presumably refers to the time of death, an inference that is confirmed in the verses. The idea of the “element of extinguishment with nothing left over” is found elsewhere in the Suttas in the same sense, but here it is more clearly defined. And while the contrast with what “has something left over” is found elsewhere in the Suttas, nowhere is this said to be an “element of extinguishment”. A fine distinction to be sure, but it indicates that the Itivuttaka is not solely a remix of teachings from elsewhere in the canon. This distinction went on to become a fundamental aspect of the Theravadin teachings on \textsanskrit{Nibbāna}.

\subsection*{The Threes}

Rather than contrasting pairs, the Threes begins with the enumeration of various sets of three principles, such as greed, hate, and delusion, or the three feelings.

While most of the teachings are familiar from elsewhere in the Suttas, we find a few unique presentations. For example, in \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti74/en/sujato}{Iti 74} a child is said to better, equal, or fail their birth, while the famous simile of the generous giver who is like a rainstorm over all quarters is found in \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti75/en/sujato}{Iti 75}. One who wisely wishes for even the worldly aims of wealth, praise, and heaven should guard their morality \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti76/en/sujato}{Iti 76}.

At \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti77/en/sujato}{Iti 77} we find a rather blunt assessment of the fragility of the body, consciousness, and all attachments. And while it is commonly said that a heavenly rebirth is a reward for good deeds, the aspiration to heaven is put to question by the fact that even the gods celebrate a mendicant going forth (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti82/en/sujato}{Iti 82}), and the end of their all-too-temporary lives is foreshadowed by five signs (\href{https://suttacentral.net/iti83/en/sujato}{Iti 83}).

Among the straightforward, didactic texts of the Itivuttaka, we find an occasional passage of a more subtle philosophical nature. Such is \href{https://suttacentral.net/iti63/en/sujato}{Iti 63} on the three “periods” of the past, future, and present. According to Buddhist philosophy, the use of language embeds notions of time in the very pathways of thought. Thus those who are still trapped in the “communicable” (\emph{akkheyya}) do not find the peace that is beyond time and reckoning (\emph{\textsanskrit{saṅkhyaṁ} nopeti}).

\subsection*{The Fours}

The discourses of the Fours are often held to be later than the other numbers; I don’t know that I am completely persuaded by this, but certainly, the section is notable for its brevity. While the exact forms of the discourses are sometimes unique to the Itivuttaka, there is nothing in the teachings that would not be familiar to a student of the four \textsanskrit{Nikāyas}.

\section*{A Brief Textual History}

A Latin-script edition of the Itivuttaka was published in 1889 by the Pali Text Society. It was edited by the handsomely-bearded Ernst Windisch, who was a professor of Sanskrit and comparative linguistics at the University of Leipzig. He made use of three manuscripts in Sinhalese script and four in Burmese, as well as a copy of the commentary. He notes that the Sinhalese manuscripts appear to have been influenced by Burmese script, an indication that they were copied from Burmese sources. His primary source was a Burmese manuscript held in the India Office Library, which he describes as “beautifully written”, and which almost always held the more correct reading. Windisch gave each Sutta a number in simple sequence, a numbering system that is still used by SuttaCentral. His discussion of the manuscripts is exemplary and well worth a read to see the process by which modern editions are created. The edition is extensively footnoted, and is praised by Ireland and by Moore, who calls it “admirable”. Masefield, however, draws attention to the “poor quality of many readings” in this edition, for which he supplies emendations.

The first English translation was published by Columbia University Press in 1908 by Justin Hartley Moore under the title \textit{Sayings of Buddha}. Moore undertook the translation for his Ph.D. program at Columbia University, a task he described as “a dive into unfathomed waters”. Moore’s introductory essay remains one of the more complete surveys of the text. And in addition, he published \textit{Metrical Analysis of the \textsanskrit{Pāli} Iti-vuttaka, a Collection of Discourses of Buddha} (Journal of the American Oriental Society, vol. 28 1907), which was an early contribution to the difficult and still understudied field of Pali meter.  On the question of authorship, Moore suggests that the verses may be older, while the prose portions “bear all the ear-marks of a short commentary on the succeeding verses”. I find his argumentation here curiously unpersuasive; he presents a couple of examples in support, but I fail to see how they relate to his argument. As I mentioned above, I think it is more likely that to the extent that the prose and verse have separate origins, the verses were added to the prose.

F.L. Woodward was the next to translate the text into English, under the title \textit{As It Was Said}. It was published by the Pali Text Society in 1935 together with his translation of the \textsanskrit{Udāna} with the collective title, \textit{Minor Anthologies of the Pali Canon, Part II}. Woodward endorses Moore’s view that the prose is a commentary on the verses. His translation is unfortunately marred by the then-fashionable tendency to render religious text with deliberate archaisms. Time has not been kind to these stylings.

As is usual with English translations from the Pali, there is a marked leap from the first or second-generation translations and those completed after the work of Bhikkhu \textsanskrit{Ñāṇamoḷi} in the 1950s. All later translators aspired to his consistency, clarity, and straightforwardness of diction. The first modern translation of the Itivuttaka was that of John Ireland, originally published through the Buddhist Publications Society in 1991, and subsequently reprinted together with his equally readable translation of the \textsanskrit{Udāna}. It contains a brief introduction and notes.

Peter Masefield published a highly literal translation in 2000 with the Pali Text Society. This was a companion to his translation of the commentary and is intended to present the text as understood by the commentator. It was completed while the translator was at the University of Sydney, which makes my translation the second to be done in Sydney. And since Woodward made his while in Tasmania, mine is the third translation of the Itivuttaka to be completed in Australia.

Bhikkhu \textsanskrit{Ṭhānissaro} published a translation in 2001 under the title \textit{This Was Said by the Buddha}, revised with a new introduction in 2013. In 2018 Anagarika Mahendra (AKA \textsanskrit{Sāmaṇera} Mahinda) published a “contemporary” translation with both Pali and English under the title \textit{Book of This Was Said} through Dhamma Publishers. And a simple English version is made available by Ven. Gnanananda Thero on his Sutta Friends website.

\markboth{Acknowledgements}{Acknowledgements}

I remember with gratitude all those from whom I have learned the Dhamma, especially Ajahn Brahm and Bhikkhu Bodhi, the two monks who more than anyone else showed me the depth, meaning, and practical value of the Suttas.

Special thanks to Dustin and Keiko Cheah and family, who sponsored my stay in Qi Mei while I made this translation.

Thanks also for Blake Walshe, who provided essential software support for my translation work.

Throughout the process of translation, I have frequently sought feedback and suggestions from the SuttaCentral community on our forum, “Discuss and Discover”. I want to thank all those who have made suggestions and contributed to my understanding, as well as to the moderators who have made the forum possible. These translations were significantly improved due to the careful work of my proofreaders: \textsanskrit{Ayyā} \textsanskrit{Pāsādā}, John and Lynn Kelly, and Derek Sola. Special thanks are due to \textsanskrit{Sabbamittā}, a true friend of all, who has tirelessly and precisely checked my work.

Finally my everlasting thanks to all those people, far too many to mention, who have supported SuttaCentral, and those who have supported my life as a monastic. None of this would be possible without you.

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.1} don’t fear good deeds. For ‘good deeds’ is a term for happiness, for what is likable, desirable, and agreeable. I recall undergoing for a long time the likable, desirable, and agreeable results of good deeds performed over a long time. Having developed a mind of love for seven years, for seven eons of the cosmos contracting and expanding I didn’t return to this world again. As the eon contracted I went to the realm of streaming radiance. As it expanded I was reborn in an empty mansion of divinity. 

There\marginnote{3.1} I was the Divinity, the Great Divinity, the vanquisher, the unvanquished, the universal seer, the wielder of power. I was Sakka, lord of gods, thirty-six times. Many hundreds of times I was a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. My dominion extended to all four sides, I achieved stability in the country, and I possessed the seven treasures. Not to mention regional kingship! 

Then\marginnote{4.1} I thought, ‘Of what deed of mine is this the fruit and result, that I am now so mighty and powerful?’ Then I thought, ‘It is the fruit and result of three kinds of deeds: giving, self-control, and restraint.’” 

The\marginnote{4.6} Buddha spoke this matter. On this it is said:

The\marginnote{3.1} Realized One loves seclusion and delights in it, so this thought often occurs to him: ‘What is unskillful has been given up.’ 

So,\marginnote{4.1} mendicants, you too should love kindness and delight in it, then this thought will often occur to you: ‘Through this behavior, I shall not hurt any creature firm or frail.’

And\marginnote{3.1} what is the element of extinguishment with residue? It’s when a mendicant is a perfected one, with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment. Their five sense faculties still remain. So long as their senses have not gone they continue to experience the agreeable and disagreeable, to feel pleasure and pain. The ending of greed, hate, and delusion in them is called the element of extinguishment with residue. 

And\marginnote{4.1} what is the element of extinguishment with no residue? It’s when a mendicant is a perfected one, with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetter of continued existence, and is rightly freed through enlightenment. For them, everything that’s felt, being no longer relished, will become cool right here. This is called the element of extinguishment with no residue. These are the two elements of extinguishment.”

And\marginnote{3.1} how do some get stuck? Because of love, delight, and enjoyment of existence, when the Dhamma is being taught for the cessation of existence, the minds of some gods and humans do not leap forth, gain confidence, settle down, and become decided. That is how some get stuck. 

And\marginnote{4.1} how do some overreach? Some, becoming horrified, repelled, and disgusted with existence, delight in ending existence: ‘When this self is annihilated and destroyed when the body breaks up, and doesn’t exist after death: that is peaceful, that is sublime, that is how it is.’ That is how some overreach. 

And\marginnote{5.1} how do those with vision see? It’s when a mendicant sees what has come to be as having come to be. Seeing this, they are practicing for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding what has come to be. That is how those with vision see.”

And\marginnote{3.1} how does a child better their birth? It’s when a child’s parents have not gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}.

But their child has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}.

the wise would take care of their ethics. 

Though\marginnote{4.1} you do no wrong, \\

you’re suspected of wrong, \\
and your disrepute grows. 

Whatever\marginnote{5.1} kind of friend you make, \\

that’s how you become, \\
for so it is when you share your life. 

The\marginnote{6.1} one who associates and the one associated with, \\
the one contacted and the one who contacts another, \\
are like an arrow smeared with poison \\

The attentive, fearing contamination, \\
would never have wicked friends. 

A\marginnote{7.1} man who wraps \\

makes the grass stink—\\

It describes a declining physical appearance (\href{https://suttacentral.net/an5.50/en/sujato\#9.4}{AN 5.50:9.4}). } When the other gods know that that god is due to pass away, they wish them well in three ways: ‘Sir, may you go from here to a good place! 

When\marginnote{3.1} you have gone to a good place, may you be blessed with good fortune! 

When\marginnote{4.1} you have been blessed with good fortune, may you become well grounded!’” 

When\marginnote{5.1} he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha, “Sir, what do the gods reckon to be going to a good place? 

What\marginnote{6.1} do they reckon to be blessed with good fortune? 

What\marginnote{7.1} do they reckon to become well grounded?” 

“It\marginnote{8.1} is human existence, mendicant, that the gods reckon to be going to a good place. 

When\marginnote{9.1} a human being gains faith in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One, that is what the gods reckon to be blessed with good fortune. 

When\marginnote{10.1} that faith in the Realized One is settled, rooted, and planted deep; when it’s strong and can’t be shifted by any ascetic or brahmin or god or \textsanskrit{Māra} or divinity or by anyone in the world, that is what the gods reckon to become well grounded.”

This is the second person who arises in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of sympathy for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{4.1} it’s when a disciple of that Teacher is a trainee, a learned practitioner with precepts and observances intact.

four-doored and terrifying.\footnote{Compare the description of hell as “four-doored” at \href{https://suttacentral.net/mn129/en/sujato\#16.3}{MN 129:16.3} = \href{https://suttacentral.net/mn130/en/sujato\#16.3}{MN 130:16.3} = \href{https://suttacentral.net/an3.36/en/sujato\#16.1}{AN 3.36:16.1}. }

This\marginnote{1.1} was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard. 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.1} these three kinds of confidence are the best. What three? Mendicants, the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, is said to be the best of all sentient beings—be they footless, with two feet, four feet, or many feet; with form or formless; with perception or without perception or with neither perception nor non-perception. Those who have confidence in the Buddha have confidence in the best. Having confidence in the best, the result is the best. 

Fading\marginnote{3.1} away is said to be the best of all things whether conditioned or unconditioned. That is, the quelling of vanity, the removing of thirst, the abolishing of clinging, the breaking of the round, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment. Those who have confidence in the teaching of fading away have confidence in the best. Having confidence in the best, the result is the best. 

The\marginnote{4.1} \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of the Realized One’s disciples is said to be the best of all communities and groups. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world. Those who have confidence in the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} have confidence in the best. Having confidence in the best, the result is the best. These are the three best kinds of confidence.”

“For\marginnote{5.1} those who, knowing the best teaching, \\

This\marginnote{1.1} was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard. 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.1} this relying on alms is an extreme lifestyle. The world curses you: ‘You beggar, walking bowl in hand!’ Yet earnest gentlemen take it up for a good reason. Not to escape a summons by a king or a summons for a bandit, or because you were in debt or in fear, or in order to make a living.\footnote{The terms here follow the same sequence as in the Vinaya account of ordination. Generally, ordination should not be given in such cases, but if it is given, those performing it incur an offense of wrong-doing. | Soldiers joined the Sangha to escape military service, so the Buddha said one should not ordain those in service to a king (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato\#40.1.1}{Kd 1:40.1.1}). | Several rules regarding ordination of criminals were passed, the thrust of which is that wanted outlaws should not be ordained (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato\#41.1.1}{Kd 1:41.1.1}). | Another man ordained to escape debt (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato\#46.1.1}{Kd 1:46.1.1}). | Seventeen boys ordained as novices to get a nice livelihood (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato\#49.1.1}{Kd 1:49.1.1}). | The only item that does not straightforwardly correspond is “in fear” (\textit{\textsanskrit{bhayaṭṭa}}). In the Vinaya sequence, the ordination of slaves appears at this point (\href{https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/sujato\#47.1.1}{Kd 1:47.1.1}). The connection is suggested by the verses of the water-carrier \textsanskrit{Puṇṇikā}, who speaks of living “in fear” of her masters’ abuse and beatings. } Rather, because they think: ‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering. Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’ That’s how this gentleman has gone forth. Yet they covet sensual pleasures; they’re infatuated, full of ill will and malicious intent. They are unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying mind and undisciplined faculties. Suppose there was a firebrand for lighting a funeral pyre, burning at both ends, and smeared with dung in the middle. It couldn’t be used as timber either in the village or the wilderness. I say that person is just like this. They’ve missed out on the pleasures of the lay life, and haven’t fulfilled the goal of the ascetic life.” 

The\marginnote{2.11} Buddha spoke this matter. On this it is said: 

\begin{verse}%
“They’ve\marginnote{3.1} left behind the pleasures of the lay life, \\
and miss out on the goal of the ascetic life. \\
Ruining it, they throw it away, \\
and perish like a funeral firebrand. 

Many\marginnote{4.1} who wear a scrap of ocher cloth \\
are unrestrained and wicked. \\
Being wicked, they are reborn in hell \\
due to their bad deeds. 

It’d\marginnote{5.1} be better for the immoral and unrestrained \\
to eat an iron ball, \\
scorching, like a burning flame, \\
than to eat the nation’s alms.”

Yet they covet sensual pleasures; they’re infatuated, full of ill will and malicious intent. They are unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying mind and undisciplined faculties. Then they are far from me, and I from them. Why is that? Because that mendicant does not see the teaching. Not seeing the teaching, they do not see me.

According to the commentary, the first category refers to humans and certain devas. } What three? Some sensual pleasures are simply present; some are for those who love to imagine; and some are for those who control what is imagined by others.

This\marginnote{1.1} was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard. 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.1} I define a brahmin in terms of the teaching as one who is master of the three knowledges, not the other who merely repeats what they are told. 

How\marginnote{3.1} so? It’s when a mendicant recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. This is the first knowledge they achieved. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{4.1} with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, a mendicant sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They denounced the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they chose to act out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never denounced the noble ones; they had right view; and they chose to act out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. This is the second knowledge they achieved. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{5.1} a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. This is the third knowledge which they achieved. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute. That’s how I define a brahmin in terms of the teaching as one who is master of the three knowledges, not the other who merely repeats what they are told.” 

The\marginnote{5.4} Buddha spoke this matter. On this it is said: 

\begin{verse}%
“One\marginnote{6.1} who knows their past lives, \\
sees heaven and places of loss, \\
and has attained the end of rebirth, \\
is a sage of perfect insight. 

Because\marginnote{7.1} of these three knowledges \\
a brahmin is a master of the three knowledges. \\
That’s who I call a three-knowledge master, \\
and not the other \\>who repeats what they are told.”

There\marginnote{3.1} are these two gifts. A gift of things of the flesh and a gift of the teaching. The better of these two gifts is the gift of the teaching.

They educate, encourage, fire up, and inspire, and can rightly explain the true teaching. Even the sight of those mendicants is very helpful, I say.\footnote{For \textit{\textsanskrit{alaṁsamakkhātāro}}, compare \href{https://suttacentral.net/dn29/en/sujato\#11.2}{DN 29:11.2}. } Even to hear them, approach them, pay homage to them, recollect them, or go forth after them is very helpful, I say.

This\marginnote{1.1} was said by the Buddha, the Perfected One: that is what I heard. 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.1} the world has been understood by the Realized One; and he is detached from the world. The origin of the world has been understood by the Realized One; and he has given up the origin of the world. The cessation of the world has been understood by the Realized One; and he has realized the cessation of the world. The practice that leads to the cessation of the world has been understood by the Realized One; and he has developed the practice that leads to the cessation of the world. 

In\marginnote{3.1} this world—with its gods, \textsanskrit{Māras}, and Divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, and explored by the mind, all that has been understood by the Realized One. That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’. 

From\marginnote{4.1} the night when the Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening until the night he becomes fully extinguished—in the element of extinguishment with no residue—everything he speaks, says, and expresses is real, not otherwise. That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’. 

The\marginnote{5.1} Realized One does as he says, and says as he does. Since this is so, that’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’. 

In\marginnote{6.1} this world—with its gods, \textsanskrit{Māras}, and divinities, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—the Realized One is the vanquisher, the unvanquished, the universal seer, the wielder of power. That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’.” 

The\marginnote{6.3} Buddha spoke this matter. On this it is said: 

\begin{verse}%
“Directly\marginnote{7.1} knowing the whole world as it is, \\
and everything in it, \\
he is detached from the whole world, \\
disengaged from the whole world. 

That\marginnote{8.1} attentive one is the champion \\
who is released from all ties. \\
He has reached ultimate peace: \\
extinguishment, fearing nothing from any quarter. 

He\marginnote{9.1} is the Buddha, with defilements ended, \\
untroubled, with doubts cut off. \\
He has attained the end of all deeds, \\
freed with the ending of attachments. 

That\marginnote{10.1} Blessed One is the Buddha, \\
he is the supreme lion, \\
in all the world with its gods, \\
he turns the divine wheel. 

And\marginnote{11.1} so those gods and humans, \\
who have gone to the Buddha for refuge, \\
come together and revere him, \\
even the deities revere him: 

‘Tamed,\marginnote{12.1} he is the best of tamers, \\
peaceful, he is the seer among the peaceful, \\
liberated, he is the foremost of liberators, \\
crossed over, he is the most excellent of guides across.’ 

And\marginnote{13.1} so they revere him, \\
great of heart and intrepid. \\
In the world with its gods, \\
he has no rival.”

This\marginnote{14.1} too is a matter that was spoken by the Blessed One: that is what I heard.

\section*{The Translator}

Bhikkhu Sujato was born as Anthony Aidan Best on 4/11/1966 in Perth, Western Australia. He grew up in the pleasant suburbs of Mt Lawley and Attadale alongside his sister Nicola, who was the good child. His mother, Margaret Lorraine Huntsman née Pinder, said “he’ll either be a priest or a poet”, while his father, Anthony Thomas Best, advised him to “never do anything for money”. He attended Aquinas College, a Catholic school, where he decided to become an atheist. At the University of WA he studied philosophy, aiming to learn what he wanted to do with his life. Finding that what he wanted to do was play guitar, he dropped out. His main band was named Martha’s Vineyard, which achieved modest success in the indie circuit. 

A seemingly random encounter with a roadside joey took him to Thailand, where he entered his first meditation retreat at Wat Ram Poeng, Chieng Mai in 1992. Feeling the call to the Buddha’s path, he took full ordination in Wat Pa Nanachat in 1994, where his teachers were Ajahn Pasanno and Ajahn Jayasaro. In 1997 he returned to Perth to study with Ajahn Brahm at Bodhinyana Monastery. 

He spent several years practicing in seclusion in Malaysia and Thailand before establishing Santi Forest Monastery in Bundanoon, NSW, in 2003. There he was instrumental in supporting the establishment of the Theravada bhikkhuni order in Australia and advocating for women’s rights. He continues to teach in Australia and globally, with a special concern for the moral implications of climate change and other forms of environmental destruction. He has published a series of books of original and groundbreaking research on early Buddhism. 

In 2005 he founded SuttaCentral together with Rod Bucknell and John Kelly. In 2015, seeing the need for a complete, accurate, plain English translation of the Pali texts, he undertook the task, spending nearly three years in isolation on the isle of Qi Mei off the coast of the nation of Taiwan. He completed the four main \textsanskrit{Nikāyas} in 2018, and the early books of the Khuddaka \textsanskrit{Nikāya} were complete by 2021. All this work is dedicated to the public domain and is entirely free of copyright encumbrance. 

In 2019 he returned to Sydney where he established Lokanta Vihara (The Monastery at the End of the World). 

\section*{Creation Process}

Translated from the Pali. The primary source was the \textsanskrit{Mahāsaṅgīti} edition, with reference to several English translations, especially those of John Ireland.

\section*{The Translation}

This translation aims to make a clear, readable, and accurate rendering of the Itivuttaka, preserving consistency with Sujato’s renderings of the main \textsanskrit{nikāyas}. 

\section*{About SuttaCentral}

SuttaCentral publishes early Buddhist texts. Since 2005 we have provided root texts in Pali, Chinese, Sanskrit, Tibetan, and other languages, parallels between these texts, and translations in many modern languages. Building on the work of generations of scholars, we offer our contribution freely.

SuttaCentral is driven by volunteer contributions, and in addition we employ professional developers. We offer a sponsorship program for high quality translations from the original languages. Financial support for SuttaCentral is handled by the SuttaCentral Development Trust, a charitable trust registered in Australia.

\section*{About Bilara}

“Bilara” means “cat” in Pali, and it is the name of our Computer Assisted Translation (CAT) software. Bilara is a web app that enables translators to translate early Buddhist texts into their own language. These translations are published on SuttaCentral with the root text and translation side by side.

\section*{About SuttaCentral Editions}
