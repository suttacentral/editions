<h1>The SuttaCentral Editions Series</h1>
<p>Since 2005 SuttaCentral has provided access to the texts, translations, and parallels of early Buddhist texts. In 2018 we started creating and publishing our translations of these seminal spiritual classics. The “Editions” series now makes selected translations available as books in various forms, including print, PDF, and EPUB.</p>
<p>Editions are selected from our most complete, well-crafted, and reliable translations. They aim to bring these texts to a wider audience in forms that reward mindful reading. Care is taken with every detail of the production, and we aim to meet or exceed professional best standards in every way. These are the core scriptures underlying the entire Buddhist tradition, and we believe that they deserve to be preserved and made available in the highest quality without compromise.</p>
<p>SuttaCentral is a charitable organization. Our work is accomplished by volunteers and through the generosity of our donors. Everything we create is offered to all of humanity free of any copyright or licensing restrictions. </p>

<h1>Preface</h1>
<p>The topic of the future weighs heavily on the mind of the Aṅguttara. We live in that future or beyond it. The “future perils” of the Aṅguttara (AN 5.77–80) are upon us and have been for quite some time. King Ashoka referred to these suttas, which include the peril of corruption in the Saṅgha; perhaps he worried that his generosity, though intended to support Buddhism, would ultimately lead to its decay. </p>
<p>Today the future perils are greater than ever. It is as if the seven suns are appearing in the sky (AN 7.66). We want to face the future with hope for a better life, but the horizon dims and draws closer, while we clutch our loved ones and prepare for the worst.</p>
<p>It was the novelist William Gibson who said, “the future is already here—it’s just not very evenly distributed”. His saying conceals layers of meaning. The future is here because we see scientific, technological, and human marvels every day that are far beyond our comprehension. Yet such advances are for the few, and only trickle gradually, if at all, to people in need. The future is also here in a negative sense, in that the catastrophic effects of climate collapse are readily apparent; and yet there too, their effects are unevenly distributed, massively impacting those who have the least capacity to deal with them. </p>
<p>The way of the Dhamma is to neither deny such things nor to be paralyzed by them, but to live, urgently and vitally, in the present. We live as if the future was uncertain, because it is. Our only certainty is that all this will disappear. </p>
<p>The Buddha stayed calm in the face of terrors. Living well now, we let the future take care of itself. The Buddha did not pretend to be able to control the future, so why should we? </p>
<p>As a Buddhist, I might rephrase Gibson’s saying: “the present is already here—it’s just not very evenly distributed”. The art of meditation is the art of presence, and in that presence, we can be grateful for all that we have, mindful of all our blessings, and fearless when facing the future. It is when we lose our presence that our fears can overcome us. So let us not lose our presence. </p>

<p>The Aṅguttara Nikāya is the last and longest of the four primary divisions of the Sutta Piṭaka. The word <i lang="pli" translate="no">aṅguttara</i> means “up by one factor”, i.e. “incremental”. It refers to the fact that the discourses are arranged by numbered sets, with the numbers increasing by one. I have translated it as <cite class="text-translated">Numbered Discourses</cite>, while previously it has been translated as the <cite class="text-translated">Numerical Discourses</cite> or the <cite class="text-translated">Gradual Sayings</cite>.</p>
<p>SuttaCentral follows Bhikkhu Bodhi’s translation in counting 8122 discourses in total. The summary verse at the end of the collection, however, says there are 9,557 suttas. This scribal remark does not say how this count was arrived at; it must have been quite a process to count so many discourses when dealing only with palm-leaf manuscripts. In any case, as with the Saṁyutta Nikāya, this count is largely a product of discourses repeated according to templates. Many of these consist only of a single word; indeed, the process of abbreviation is carried to such extremes that hundreds of suttas do not exist at all in the text; they are merely numbers to be filled out. Also, in the case of the Ones and Twos, most of the suttas are longer texts that have been divided to make the numbers. On SuttaCentral, these are treated as if one <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> was a sutta, and the abbreviated texts likewise are combined. If we count the files of the texts combined in this way, we arrive at more reasonable, but still very large, 1407 texts of substance.</p>
<p>The focus of the <cite class="text-translated">Numbered Discourses</cite> is on practical matters of everyday relevance. Guidelines of ethics and character predominate. If the Saṁyutta Nikāya gathers the chief teachings on <em>doctrines</em>, the Aṅguttara gathers the teachings on <em>persons</em>. The concerns of the lay community are a major focus, and many teachings deal with how to teach.</p>
<p>The use of numbered sets is found throughout the Buddhist texts, but here it becomes the main organizing principle. The typical Aṅguttara discourse consists of a statement that there is certain number of something; then an explanation of each item; then a conclusion that echoes the introduction. Sometimes a verse is added that summarizes the content. This formal pattern is highly optimized to reinforce learning and memorization. It is, in essence, the same format that is used in the nightly news: begin by listing the news items for today; give the stories of each of the items; and then summarize the highlights once more. The use of numbered sets remains popular today, with the “listicle” being a favorite format for internet articles.</p>
<p>Unlike these modern examples, however, the sets of teachings in the Aṅguttara are strongly structured. They are not merely collections of items on a theme, but make up an integrated sequence. The first item is the most fundamental; the subsequent items evolve from or build upon that; and the final item caps off the sequence.</p>
<p>For this reason the Aṅguttara provides an excellent entry point to the canon, especially for those with a limited amount of time. It only takes a few minutes to read a sutta, and it will contain within itself a complete and useful teaching.</p>
<p>The Aṅguttara Nikāya has a counterpart in the Ekottarikāgama preserved in the Chinese canon (EA). The Ekottarikāgama is a peculiar text of uncertain (possibly Mahāsaṅghika) affiliation, and it differs from the Pali text to a much greater extent than the parallels for DN, MN, and SN. In addition, there are two partial Ekottarikas in Chinese, as well as several independent Ekottarika-style suttas. Moreover, a substantial portion of a Sanskrit Ekottarāgama was discovered at Gilgit and has been edited and partially reconstructed by Tripāṭhi. While it is difficult to generalize, it seems as if most of these materials lie closer to the Pali text than the main EA in Chinese.</p>
<h2 id="intro-item1">How the Aṅguttara is Organized</h2>
<p>The Aṅguttara Nikāya consists of major “books” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i>) numbered one through eleven. Each of these contains discourses consisting of the corresponding number of items. As usual, the discourses are gathered into <i lang="pli" translate="no">vaggas</i>, which sometimes have a loose theme. Each <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i>, except the first, organizes its <i lang="pli" translate="no">vaggas</i> into <i lang="pli" translate="no">paṇṇāsas</i>.</p>
<p>I don’t know why the Aṅguttara counts to eleven; I would expect a round number. Eleven is shared in common with the Chinese Ekottarikāgama, which suggests it was an early feature, yet it does not appear to be driven by the texts themselves, as most of the items in the Book of the Elevens consist of teachings familiar elsewhere, with the addition of an item or two.</p>
<p>It sometimes feels as if the Aṅguttara was assembled from leftovers. After the long suttas were gathered in the Majjhima and Dīgha, and the shorter suttas on central themes into the Saṁyutta, a large mass of texts remained that resisted easy categorization. This included many fascinating and profound teachings, as well as a large mass of stock repetitions, and it trailed off into odds and ends of increasingly obscure value. It’s as if the redactors, faced with a warehouse of leftovers and bric-à-brac, tried their best to shelve and stack the items in a logical way, but were often left with just plonking things on shelves as best they could. Since the texts usually had a distinct number in the teaching, this was taken as the organizational principle, in lieu of anything more meaningful. Even texts that don’t explicitly mention a number can often be analyzed into a set of items, so they could be included too. (See for example <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.31">AN 3.31</a> and <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.32">AN 3.32</a>.)</p>
<p>To be clear, it should not be thought that the Aṅguttara lacks the standard teachings familiar from the rest of the <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i>. On the contrary, we find the four absorptions (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.58">AN 3.58</a>), the four noble truths and dependent origination (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.61">AN 3.61</a>), the faculties and powers (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an4.163">AN 4.163</a>; the latter in some detail at <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an5.12">AN 5.12–16</a>), the threefold training (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.81">AN 3.81</a>), the divine meditations (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.63">AN 3.63</a>), and many more. But such teachings are scattered throughout a large mass of suttas on a diverse range of topics.</p>
<p>In the introduction to his translation, Bhikkhu Bodhi practically abandons any attempt to make sense of the structure. He gives an example of a chapter with several seemingly unrelated discourses, remarking: “With such apparently arbitrary organization, one cannot but wonder what the compilers had in mind.” (<cite class="book">The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha</cite>, introduction, p. 22). As a result, rather than analyze the content as it occurs in the Aṅguttara, he developed an extensive and carefully-considered thematic analysis. <a href="https://suttacentral.net/an-introduction-bodhi">This essay is available on SuttaCentral</a>, and I encourage anyone interested in a serious study of the Aṅguttara to read it.</p>
<p>I would like to approach the material from a different perspective, however, one that lies closer to the experience of reading the text. I find Bhikkhu Bodhi’s question an intriguing one: what were the redactors thinking?</p>
<p>While there is no doubt that the sequence of suttas and ideas in the Aṅguttara is to some extent chaotic, is it plausible that the same body of people who displayed such rigorous dedication to classification in the Saṁyutta should simply abandon their efforts in the Aṅguttara? Perhaps to understand the redactors better, and through them the teachings that they worked with, we must approach the problem in a new way.</p>
<p>Here are three organizational principles that I have noticed while reading the Aṅguttara:</p>
<ol>
<li>Numerological meaning.</li>
<li>Thematic clusters, segues, and arcs.</li>
<li>Spaced repetition.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below I will show how these things work out over the first three <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipātas</i>. In this way, I hope to guide a reader through the wilds until they feel comfortable proceeding on their own.</p>
<p>It is surely not the case that these are the only organizational principles at work. Nor is it the case that they fully explain all, or even most, of the randomness. But they do, I believe, hint at a guiding understanding that shaped the collection in the form we have it today.</p>
<p>One general thought first. Much of how we organize and relate to the world is not through reason but through association. If we think of it in terms of the five aggregates, a collection such as the Saṁyutta Nikāya has an overall structure that is deliberately thought through and constructed, i.e. it is based on rational choices or <i lang="pli" translate="no">saṅkhārās</i>. Perhaps what we need to look for in the Aṅguttara is a different way of thinking, one based on perception, memory, and association (<i lang="pli" translate="no">saññā</i>).</p>
<p>But why would such a large mass of texts be organized in such a way? The answer is not hard to find. Like so many of the principles that organize the texts, it is for memorization. For a reciter who has to keep hundreds of texts in order, <em>any</em> kind of connection works. It doesn’t matter if it’s the topic, a shared word, a syntax, a rhyme, or anything else. Perception recognizes patterns. It associates one thing with the next, regardless of how significant the connecting feature is.</p>
<p>Imagine, if you will, that you’re organizing your library. You could use a rational system: alphabetical order, subject matter, or size to fit your shelves. But it’s your library, you can do what you want. Maybe on one shelf, you put books with blue covers; on another, books you haven’t read; and on another, books whose smell reminds you of old friends. To anyone else it seems chaotic, but to you it makes perfect sense. You can find the book you need when you want to. Perception does the heavy lifting for you, without the cognitive strain of having to work through the rational system every time.</p>
<h3>The meaning of numbers</h3>
<p>For the most part the use of numbers in Buddhist texts is entirely pragmatic. Once you know that a set has a certain number of items, you can tell if you’ve forgotten something.</p>
<p>Yet numbers have always been imbued with a significance and meaning that transcends mere accounting. They allow us to make sense of a complex cosmos through a simple set of conventions. Numbers are used in Buddhism to provoke awe, even fear, at the “astronomical” scope of transmigration. Is it possible that the symbolic meaning of numbers lends a sense of unity to the various <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipātas</i>?</p>
<p>Symbolic meaning is, by its very nature, impossible to pin down with precision. Unlike rational definition, it does not serve to limit the scope of meaning but to amplify it through suggestion, hints, and connotations. The symbolic meaning of numbers has, so far as I know, mostly been ignored in Buddhist studies. Some numerological observations were made in the number entries in the Rhys Davids’ and Stede’s <cite class="book">Pali-English Dictionary</cite>, but I am aware of little since then. However, we can make a few general observations.</p>
<dl>
<dt>One</dt>
<dd>The number of harmony, simplicity, and supremacy. It is especially emphasized in the context of deep meditation (<i lang="pli" translate="no">jhāna</i> or <i lang="pli" translate="no">samādhi</i>). However, unlike many spiritual contexts, in Buddhism it never has a metaphysical sense: Nibbāna is zero, not one; it is emptiness, not unity.</dd>
<dt>Two</dt>
<dd>Used for pairs, which may be partners—hands, eyes, man and wife—opponents—good vs. evil, light vs. dark, pain vs. pleasure—or successors—skill in entering meditation and skill in leaving it. It represents the dualities of the world.</dd>
<dt>Three</dt>
<dd>Made up of 2 + 1. It adds an extra, often spiritual, dimension to the worldly dualism of two. This is quite explicit in such sets as “gratification, drawback, and escape”, and more subtly in, say, pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings. Three represents the <em>other</em>; and it is the other which contains the seed of transcendence.</dd>
<dt>Four</dt>
<dd>The most characteristic number of Buddhism, and the Book of the Fours is the largest of the <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipātas</i>. Its primary metaphor is the four quarters, and thus connotes totality and balance, most obviously in the four noble truths. Multiples of four have the same meaning at a higher order. Ten is similar, in that it is derived from the four quarters, the four intermediate quarters, and above and below.</dd>
<dt>Five</dt>
<dd>Stems from the hand, which is what we use to count; hence it divides into 4 + 1 (fingers and thumb) rather than 2 + 3. The most obvious example of this is the five “grasping” aggregates, where consciousness stands against the other four. Likewise in, say, the five faculties and powers, wisdom is the “thumb”.</dd>
<dt>Six</dt>
<dd>Takes as its root metaphor the body: four limbs, torso, and head. The general sense is a “large whole”, and the most prominent set is the six sense fields.</dd>
<dt>Seven</dt>
<dd>An astronomical number, derived from the lunar cycles and the heavenly bodies (sun + moon + five visible planets). It is used especially commonly in myth, and has the general sense of “the entire cycle of life and death”. It appears in this sense in the story of the Bodhisatta’s birth.</dd>
</dl>
<p>I believe that we can indeed discern traces of these meanings in the Aṅguttara, and offer some examples below. In some cases, the texts of a certain number would have been simply imported into the collection, while in other cases the text would have been edited specifically to create the necessary numbered set. Either way, having some sense of these meanings gives us a perspective through which to see the <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipātas</i> as meaningful wholes.</p>
<p>With such general meanings, and doubtless many exceptions and contradictions, it is not possible to establish beyond doubt that the numbers of the Aṅguttara have a symbolic meaning. If you dislike any attempt at reading symbolic meaning, I cannot prove you wrong. But it does, I believe, give us an approach through which to appreciate why the redactors dealt with their diverse and complex material in this way.</p>
<h3>Thematic clusters, segues, and arcs</h3>
<p>Despite its chaotic impression, suttas in the Aṅguttara are rarely isolated. Most of the time they appear in <em>thematic clusters</em> that deal with the same topic. This might be just a pair of suttas, though it’s not uncommon to find an entire <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> on a specific theme. These are often closely related suttas, simply varying a few details from one to the next. Or they may have a loose thematic thread, featuring, for example, the same person, or group of persons. In several cases, <i lang="pli" translate="no">vaggas</i> of the same name and theme appear multiple times in the collection.</p>
<p>Such thematic clusters are easy to recognize; but still, it often seems as if there is nothing that connects one cluster with the next. However, this is not always the case. Often the shift from one cluster to another happens through what might be called a <em>thematic segue</em>. When moving from one thematic cluster to the next, some common element is maintained. This might be a topic, or simply some formal feature—a question format, a word, a syntax, etc. Such hooks help smooth the transition from cluster to cluster.</p>
<p>In such cases we find that there is some element in the first cluster [A], which is combined with a second element [AB] to form a new cluster or extend the old one. Then the second element is combined with something else to make yet another cluster [BC]. And perhaps later the second element is dropped altogether leaving just the third [C], or it is recombined with something new. If you compare the first element [A] with the third [C] there’s nothing in common. Yet the progress from one to the other is gradual. And the frequency with which this occurs shows that it is by no means accidental.</p>
<p>Similar techniques are a stock in trade of musical composition. After introducing a motif, the composer gradually transforms and develops it. Eventually, they might arrive at a new motif, which shares nothing in common with the original, but from which it evolved.</p>
<p>A thematic segue is often a purely formal technique that says little about the subject matter. However, with careful attention we can see that thematic clusters, chained together with segues, sometimes evolve over larger spans of text to create a loosely organized <em>thematic arc</em>. Such arcs echo teaching frameworks that are familiar from elsewhere, such as the Gradual Training. This is used, for example, to inform the shape of the first 75 suttas of the Book of the Ones. Such arcs are by no means as clear and formally structured as the teachings on which they are based. Yet the progress from one topic to the next is undeniable.</p>
<p>Indeed, each <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i> can be seen as forming its own arc, as they typically begin with basic practices, and end with realizing Nibbāna. The repetition series that round out each <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i> also have their internal arc, leading towards the highest qualities.</p>
<h3>Spaced repetition</h3>
<p>In the Dīgha and Majjhima Nikāyas, a student would spend a fair period of time memorizing one specific text, rehearsing it, and—if they are a good student—inquiring and questioning about the meaning. Only when it was mastered would they move on to the next. In the Saṁyutta, a student would learn dozens, even hundreds of suttas on the same topic, sharing similar passages and ideas, and often varying little one to the other. Such suttas may be memorized quickly, and interpretive problems often arise at the level of the topic rather than the individual text.</p>
<p>But memorizing long texts, or many texts on the same subject, can get boring, for the mind is stimulated by variety and surprise. In the Aṅguttara, a student would learn one or two suttas on a topic, or maybe a few more, then something else, then back to the original topic, then a third. Now, as we have seen, various features help keep the sequence of texts straight. But perhaps there is something more to it: perhaps the very randomness and repetition help them to learn.</p>
<p>This is a lot like the modern technique known as “spaced repetition”, commonly used for language learning. A vocabulary of words is introduced one at a time in a random sequence. After learning one word, one moves on to another. But the first word is then re-introduced a little later to reinforce learning. And so it goes, with the same words coming back again and again. In terms of the sequence from one word to the next, everything is random. But the overall pattern is carefully optimized to reinforce and speed up memorization.</p>
<p>Perhaps we could think of it like a school. The Saṁyutta is like a school <em>curriculum</em>: everything you need to know on a topic, all in one place. But the Aṅguttara is like a school <em>day</em>. One class follows the other, and there is no real rhyme and reason to it. Some things happen fairly regularly and predictably, while others seem to just pop up at random. Despite its more chaotic nature, it works: that’s how we learn. No one would suggest that school subjects are best mastered by first learning the science curriculum, then the maths, then the history. Not only does the spaced repetition reinforce learning, but it provokes us to see new and unexpected connections between things.</p>
<h2 id="intro-item2">The Book of the Ones</h2>
<p>I have suggested that the number one carries with it a specific set of connotations, notably harmony, simplicity, and supremacy. If this is framed as an overall theme, it might be something like this: keep your spiritual practice simple and focused to help your mind attain deep immersion, and in that way, you can realize the supreme Dhamma. Let us see how the Book of the Ones exemplifies these attributes.</p>
<p>The Book of the Ones is a rather special case in that virtually the entire <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i> is constructed from fragments and templates. The collection begins with the striking assertion that no sight occupies a man’s mind like that of a woman, or a woman’s mind like that of a man. The remainder of the exterior senses are listed for each gender binary, making ten suttas in all for the first <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i>. This very much has the appearance of a single sutta divided into ten. In the Fives (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an5.55">AN 5.55</a>) we find a similar set of statements given in a particular context, dealing with the masculine perspective only. And in the Chinese, we find that the parallels at EA 9.7 and EA 9.8 fit the two halves of this <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i>. This supports the idea that these texts were originally combined to form a single sutta, or perhaps a pair of suttas.</p>
<p>An even clearer example of this is provided by the three pairs of suttas at <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.76">AN 1.76</a> to <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.81">AN 1.81</a>. Each of the pairs follows the same pattern, exemplified by the first pair. <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.76">AN 1.76</a> says that the loss of relatives is a small thing, while wisdom is the worst thing to lose. <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.77">AN 1.77</a> presents the inverse: growth of relatives is a small thing, for wisdom is the best thing to grow. But it continues to round off the sutta by urging the mendicants to train to grow in wisdom. This conclusion is lacking in the first of the pair and is a clear sign that the text has been divided.</p>
<p>One should not conclude from this that the text has been assembled haphazardly. On the contrary, we can identify a series of arcs that bind long series of suttas together. The opening chapters are designed to show the development of meditation, echoing the meditator’s progress in the Gradual Training.</p>
<ul>
<li>The first chapter, as we have seen already, deals with the restraint of sexuality, one of the foundations of meditation.</li>
<li>The second chapter deals with the hindrances which must be abandoned before entering deep meditation. This is linked via a thematic segue from the previous chapter, the link being the phrase “I do not see a single thing”.</li>
<li>The third and fourth chapters deal with the advantages of the developed mind, which has been purified through the process of meditation: nothing brings greater happiness and benefit. They continue using the phrase “I do not see a single thing”.</li>
<li>The fifth chapter abandons the phrase “I do not see a single thing”. Here the thematic segue is the topic of “mind” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">citta</i>) and its development.</li>
<li>The fifth chapter ends with two discourses that mention the famous “radiant mind”. These are fragments, and a more complete statement is found in the following suttas that start the next chapter. It is somewhat unusual to find such closely connected suttas broken over a <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> boundary like this. Note that the “radiant mind” is not a metaphysical term, and neither here nor anywhere else in the early Buddhist texts is the mind said to be “intrinsically” or “naturally” or “originally” radiant or luminous. On the contrary, the mind is conditioned and hence is not “intrinsically” anything at all. The radiant mind is simply a way of talking about meditative absorption or <i lang="pli" translate="no">jhāna</i>.</li>
<li>The sixth chapter continues on the theme of absorption. However, it changes theme at <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.56">AN 1.56</a>—though maintaining focus on “mind”—and continues by addressing the causality of good and bad qualities. In context, these can be understood as pertaining to the wisdom portion of meditation, as treated in the fourth of the <i lang="pli" translate="no">satipaṭṭhānas</i>. This series culminates at <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.75">AN 1.75</a> with the perfection of the awakening factors, thus signifying the completion of the path.</li>
</ul>
<p>A structure such as this is particularly telling as it reveals the intent of the redactors. This thematic arc spanning 75 fragmentary suttas does not exist in the sources at all: it is purely implied by the choices of the redactors. Their method was to reduce the statements of the Dhamma to their simplest meaningful elements, then reassemble them according to the principles of the Dhamma as they understood them.</p>
<p>And the redactors were even more subtle than that. For not only are these fragments assembled to form a coherent whole, but the choice of theme was quite deliberate. Of all the doctrinal contexts in Buddhism, it is <i lang="pli" translate="no">samādhi</i> or “unification of mind” where the number one is most prominent. In starting with the Ones, the redactors were sensitive to the use of numbers in the canon, and arranged their texts to bring the most important “one” to the fore.</p>
<p>From here, the text shifts focus. As noted above, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.71-81">AN 1.76–81</a> deals with pairs of gain and loss. Then from <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.82-97">AN 1.82</a> we have a series of texts on those things that are harmful and beneficial, starting with the pair of negligence and diligence. While these teachings are of course common throughout the canon, it is fitting that they appear here to represent the Aṅguttara’s special focus on the fundamentals of a good life. Here they exemplify the aspect of <em>simplicity</em>, helping a student to focus on just one aspect of Dhamma at a time.</p>
<p>The same set of factors is treated a few times with slightly varying templates, the final of which says that each of these harmful things leads to the disappearance of Buddhism, while the good things lead to its continuation. This leads us up to <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.98-139">AN 1.129</a>.</p>
<p>From <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.98-139">AN 1.130–169</a>, the topic of the preservation of the Dhamma is continued, but applied to a new theme, one that is quite distinctive of the Aṅguttara: teaching the Dhamma. Specifically, those who present the Dhamma accurately make much merit and preserve Buddhism, while those who distort or misrepresent the Dhamma make bad karma and destroy Buddhism. This series of texts displays its inner structure, as it begins with simply the “teaching” and then continues to differentiate the Dhamma more and more finely, especially with the introduction of the Vinaya and a rather extensive list of technical terms for monastic discipline. It does not take much to see that an originally simple statement could have been drawn out by adding multiple aspects of the teaching, conveniently giving the students of the Aṅguttara some Vinaya material to learn.</p>
<p>This series of suttas grows out of the former, with the theme of preserving Buddhism as the thematic segue. Thus we have, from <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.82-97">AN 1.82</a> through <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.150-169">AN 1.169</a>, a second thematic arc consisting of 88 suttas.</p>
<p>From <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.170-187">AN 1.170</a> a new theme is introduced, one that also represents a key aspect of the Aṅguttara: persons. Buddhism is, of course, most famous for its teachings on not-self, and its impersonal analysis of psychological processes. But there is plenty of material throughout the suttas that deals with persons, or character types, and much of that is in the Aṅguttara. These texts were later assembled to form the Abhidhamma text the Puggalapaññatti, the “Description of Persons”.</p>
<p>Of all the persons in Buddhism, the incomparable one is the Buddha himself. While there is a series of Buddhas over the ages, in our age he is unique. Hence these suttas speak of the “one person” who arises in the world who is uniquely beneficial and transcendent. At <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.170-187">AN 1.187</a> the Buddha’s chief disciple, Sāriputta, is praised as the one who continues to roll the wheel of Dhamma after the Buddha. This segues into the next series of suttas, which single out individual followers of the Buddha for particular praise. This is a rather fascinating list, in which appear many characters from all over the canon; not only the four <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i>, but the Vinaya and the Khuddaka as well. Prominent monks appear in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.188-197">AN 1.188–234</a>; nuns from <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.235-247">AN 1.235–247</a>; laymen from <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.248-257">AN 1.248–257</a>; and laywomen, from <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.258-267">AN 1.258–267</a>. All of these people are “number one” in their field, exemplifying the sense of “one” as <em>supremacy</em>.</p>
<p>The next chapter continues the theme of “persons”, enumerating various things that are possible or impossible for various people. For example, it is impossible for one “attained to view”—that is, a stream-enterer—to take any condition as permanent. But from <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.278-286">AN 1.284–295</a>, once again we find a thematic segue; the “person” vanishes and the theme of possible and impossible is applied rather on an impersonal level: good things cannot come from bad deeds.</p>
<p>This makes up the third great thematic arc in the Ones, 126 suttas from <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.170-187">AN 1.170</a> to <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an1.287-295">AN 1.295</a>. The remainder of the Ones continues similarly, with fragmented suttas assembled along loose thematic lines. The themes remain similar, with one difference. As the Book draws closer to its end, the subject of Nibbāna, the final goal of Buddhism, becomes ever more prominent. The final <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> is called the “Chapter on the Deathless”, and it deals directly with the path to full awakening. Thus the sense of thematic unity that has been evident in multiple sections of the Book of the Ones is also evident in its overall structure, assembled by the redactors to culminate in awakening.</p>
<h2 id="intro-item3">The Book of the Twos</h2>
<p>The second <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i> is a kind of bridge between the “arcs of fragments” that characterize the first <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i> and the more complete suttas that become prominent in the remainder of the Aṅguttara. It echoes and amplifies the themes of the first <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i>, while also introducing new ideas.</p>
<p>It begins with a series of suttas that speak of the fundamental principles of the good life: doing good and avoiding bad (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.1-10">AN 2.3–4</a>) and the results of deeds in this life and the next (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.1-10">AN 2.1</a>). This, I think, announces what the redactors aimed to be the chief theme of this <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i>: the idea that there is a moral order in the world, there is good and evil, and if we comprehend this we can live our life well. The collection starts by emphasizing this fact, and the dire consequences of ignoring it.</p>
<p>The second chapter builds on this, speaking on the “power of reflection” to look back and understand this moral order, and the “power of development” to move on from the bad and develop the good (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20">AN 2.11–13</a>). A specific example of this is given in the case of a disciplinary measure within the Saṅgha (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20">AN 2.15</a>; cp. <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.21-31">AN 2.21</a>). When one mendicant accuses another of wrongdoing, both should “reflect” on what happened and their role in the affair, and only then can the issue be properly healed and everyone move on. This chapter also details in various respects the way that good and bad deeds lead to various results (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20">AN 2.16</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20">AN 2.17</a>), spelling out a series of results that pertain both to this life and the next (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20">AN 2.18</a>). The Buddha then introduces the idea of a deliberate practice: one should not only recognize these things and reflect on them within oneself but develop the good and give up the bad, for it is possible to do so (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20">AN 2.19</a>).</p>
<p>These suttas (and others) build on the teachings found in the first <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i> that deal with basic principles. They conclude the opening arc that establishes the theme of this <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i>: the worldly duality of good and bad, which creates both a responsibility and an opportunity to respond.</p>
<p>But it should not be thought that these chapters are fully coherent and systematic. One finds the occasional sutta that appears quite random, for example <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.1-10">AN 2.10</a> on entering the rainy season retreat; or <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.52-63">AN 2.60</a> on why fauns (<i lang="pli" translate="no">kimpurisa</i>) do not use human speech.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, distinct themes from the first <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i> are also introduced, mixed up without clear order. <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20">AN 2.14</a> mentions two ways of teaching Dhamma—in brief and in detail—while <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20">AN 2.20</a> says that the survival of Buddhism depends on getting both the meaning and the phrasing of the texts correct (also see <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41">AN 2.41</a>). <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.21-31">AN 2.23</a> reprises the theme that one who distorts the teaching misrepresents the Buddha and contributes to the ending of Buddhism. This applies to those who claim that things were spoken by the Buddha when they were not.</p>
<p><a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.21-31">AN 2.24</a> introduces the contrast between the discourses that require interpretation (<i lang="pli" translate="no">neyyattha</i>) and those whose meaning is explicit (<i lang="pli" translate="no">nītattha</i>). In some suttas (eg. <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn133">MN 133</a>), we find that the Buddha gives a brief statement which the mendicants do not understand, so they seek advice on how to interpret it. In other cases a verse or doctrinal statement is unclear and the mendicants discuss it. These examples show that the process of discussion and analysis of the Buddha’s teaching was underway from the very beginning. This process was eventually to be formalized as the various sets of Abhidhamma texts and spelled out in the commentaries. But these later texts did not yet exist, and should not be read back into the suttas.</p>
<p><a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.21-31">AN 2.31</a> reintroduces another of the themes of the first <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i>: meditation. The pair of serenity (<i lang="pli" translate="no">samatha</i>) and discernment (or “insight”, <i lang="pli" translate="no">vipassanā</i>) are said to play a part in realization: serenity develops the mind, while <i lang="pli" translate="no">vipassanā</i> develops wisdom. Together they lead to the two aspects of awakening: the freedom of heart and the freedom by wisdom.</p>
<p>But this is, for the moment, an isolated text, for the next series of texts returns to the theme of persons. This theme was briefly introduced earlier, when <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.1-10">AN 2.2</a> contrasted the efforts of lay folk and renunciants. <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41">AN 2.32</a> says that a good person knows gratitude, while the bad one does not. <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41">AN 2.33</a> speaks of the strongest and most emotional ties of gratitude, those of a child to their parents. The Buddha says that even by carrying your parents around for the rest of their lives, feeding and cleaning them, you cannot repay them the gift of life. Only by establishing them in the principles of the Dhamma can you repay them. The theme of respect for parents is further developed in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.31">AN 3.31</a>.</p>
<p>In <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41">AN 2.35</a> the Buddha tells a brahmin that the traditional religious donation (<i lang="pli" translate="no">dakkhiṇa</i>) is owed to those who are purified, that is, the trainee and master on the path. These replace the sacrifice of the brahmins. Next follow some teachings by disciples, in which both Sāriputta (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41">AN 2.36</a>) and Mahākaccāna (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41">AN 2.38</a>) make a distinction between inner and outer practice, while Mahākaccāna makes a shrewd observation: householders argue about sensual pleasures, but renunciants argue over views (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41">AN 2.37</a>). In <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.32-41">AN 2.39</a> the Buddha makes a rather biting comparison between a kingdom overrun with bandits and a Saṅgha where the good mendicants are weak, cowed into silence. The following chapter (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.42-51">AN 2.42–51</a>) expands on this by contrasting good and bad assemblies.</p>
<p>From assemblies as groups of people, the text revisits yet another theme of the first <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i>: the Buddha as the supreme person. Here he is paired with his worldly counterpart, the wheel-turning emperor (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.52-63">AN 2.52–55</a>). Continuing with the theme of kinds of people, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.52-63">AN 2.62</a> and <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.52-63">AN 2.63</a> describe procedures in the Saṅgha for settling disputes and living harmoniously.</p>
<p>The next chapter is tightly constructed on the subject of happiness (<i lang="pli" translate="no">sukha</i>). It introduces the topic by contrasting the happiness of lay people and that of renunciants, of which the latter is better (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.64-76">AN 2.64</a>). This continues the theme of persons, specifically the contrast between lay folk and renunciants, which was already stated in the second text of the <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i>. Here it is combined with the topic of happiness, which is new. A series of suttas expands on this theme, but it uses a thematic segue to move away from the focus on “persons” and speak of happiness in purely psychological terms more reminiscent of the Saṁyutta.</p>
<p>This chapter itself forms another segue—a nested segue if you will—to the next series of chapters, the unifying characteristic being the tight integration of short suttas on a single pattern in a <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i>, returning to the kind of “vagga as sutta” that we saw in the Book of the Ones. Chapter 8 deals with the causes for good and bad qualities; Chapter 9 deals with various miscellaneous pairs of “things” (<i lang="pli" translate="no">dhammā</i>); Chapter 10 deals with the contrast between the fool and the astute; and Chapter 11, while a little more diverse, caps off this series.</p>
<p><a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.130-140">AN 2.130</a>–<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.130-140">AN 2.133</a> eulogize great disciples, reminding us of the lists of the foremost disciples in the Book of the Ones. A few discourses then revisit the theme of good and bad people inheriting the results of their deeds (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.130-140">AN 2.134</a>–<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.130-140">AN 2.137</a>). The remainder of the <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i> lists a long series of pairs of contrasted qualities. Particularly interesting is the series at <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.280-309">AN 2.280–309</a> where the Buddha gives the reasons for laying down rules for monastics. Normally this is a list of ten reasons, but here they are arranged as pairs. The final series speaks of developing deep understanding and letting go through the pair of serenity and discernment. Thus, despite its main focus on worldly ethics and results, the second <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i>, like the first, ends with the practices leading to awakening.</p>
<h2 id="intro-item4">The Book of the Threes</h2>
<p>With this book we move on from the fragmentary assemblages of the Book of the Ones and partly the Book of the Twos, and find more conventionally unified suttas. Of course, this is never an absolute, as all the books of the Aṅguttara retain extensive repetition series. Still, the focus from now is clearly on the whole sutta; and as a consequence, the hand of the redactors is harder to discern.</p>
<p>That does not mean, however, that there is a dramatic break from the first books. On the contrary, the Book of the Threes begins with a thematic <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> that focuses on the familiar contrasting pair of the fool and the astute. The number three is represented in the qualities that are said to characterize them. The Bālavagga (Chapter on the Fool) corresponds to the similarly-named third and tenth chapters of the Twos, as well as the second chapter of the Fives.</p>
<p>Like the Books of the Ones and Twos, this <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i> begins by emphasizing the problematic situation that we are in, the tensions and struggles of our worldly situation. The second <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> shifts focus to what we can do about it.</p>
<p>Thus in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.13">AN 3.13</a> we first see a clear example of the number three as a worldly binary and a transcendent dimension that resolves the contradiction. This sutta speaks of one without hope—someone afflicted by poverty and misery of station, as well as illness of body—and a hopeful person, who looks to a bright future. But then there is the one who has done away with hope: since they have achieved their goal, there is nothing to look forward to.</p>
<p><a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.14">AN 3.14</a> makes an important political point: even the greatest of rulers are subject to the rule of law (<i lang="pli" translate="no">dhamma</i>). Here the relevant group of three is action by body, speech, and mind. This triad—which is pre-Buddhist—expresses one of the fundamental principles of the Dhamma, the focus on ethical choices and good deeds. It is found constantly throughout the Threes. Whereas a worldly philosophy might take into consideration only a person’s external acts of body and speech, for Buddhism the mind is always the most important. It is the mind that is ultimately responsible for what we do and say, and it is through the mind that freedom is found. Thus the mind here points to the transcendent dimension of escape.</p>
<p>The next discourse continues with the threefold division of body, speech, and mind, giving some practical advice as to how to work for their proper development. For the first time the Aṅguttara ventures into narrative. It tells the story of a chariot maker of the past, who was commissioned by the king to make a new war chariot for a battle in six months. This is a rather striking setup: the scale of society is so small that it is unremarkable for a king to personally speak to a chariot-maker. And apparently, a single chariot is an adequate military build-up for war; a war that is, politely enough, scheduled precisely six months in advance. The small scale and low stakes of this charming story are a strong contrast with the elaborate and fanciful legends of the Dīgha.</p>
<p>The chariot-maker completes the first wheel only six days before the battle and is urged to rush the second one. But time matters: the first wheel is well-formed and stable, while the second wobbles and crashes. The Buddha then goes on to identify himself as the chariot-maker. This too is remarkable, as it is one of the very few Jātaka stories in the four <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i>. The Buddha-to-be’s humble station as a lowly chariot-maker is unusual, as usually he is said to be a great king of the past. It’s also noteworthy that his commission is morally dubious: he is an arms manufacturer. Later the Aṅguttara will say that trade in arms is one of the forms of wrong livelihood (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an5.177">AN 5.177</a>). One might argue that a chariot is not a weapon, but it is explicitly required as a war vehicle, and today we would not hesitate to count, say, tanks or fighter jets as weapons platforms. In the later Jātaka collection, it is not unusual for the Bodhisatta to break precepts or commit various acts of dubious morality; after all, the whole point is that he is not yet perfect. Still, this adds to the striking impression of this little tale, so much more down to earth and realistic than the other Jātakas in the <i lang="pli" translate="no">nikāyas</i>.</p>
<p><a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.16">AN 3.16</a> introduces the idea of the “guaranteed practice”, which consists of three of the elements of the Gradual Training: sense restraint, eating in moderation, and wakefulness. These implicitly call back to the very first chapter of the Aṅguttara, here presented in a more standard form.</p>
<p>One of the Aṅguttara’s characteristic rhetorical devices is to contrast the worldly with the sacred; remember how <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.1-10">AN 2.2</a> spoke of the efforts of the lay and the renunciant. <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.19">AN 3.19</a> expands this theme, comparing a shopkeeper who must work morning, noon, and night with a mendicant who applies themselves to their meditation morning, noon, and night. <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.20">AN 3.20</a> applies the same metaphor in a different way. These suttas cap off the first arc, which deals with understanding the dangers of the world, and working to escape from it.</p>
<p>The third chapter revisits the theme of “persons”. It begins with a discussion among some senior mendicants regarding who is best out of three kinds of spiritually attained person; or in other words, who has best implemented the practice encouraged in the first two chapters (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.21">AN 3.21</a>). An interesting comparison is made between the treatment of illness and providing spiritual assistance: you can’t always help, but you should at least try (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.22">AN 3.22</a>).</p>
<p> Several suttas in the Threes share a pattern where the first item is a foundation, the second is the realization of the four noble truths, and the third is full awakening. This first appears at <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.12">AN 3.12</a>, and is applied in different ways in <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.24">AN 3.24</a> and <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.25">AN 3.25</a>.</p>
<p>Returning to the theme of meditative immersion with which the entire collection started, we are introduced to an intriguing teaching that reappears multiple times in the Aṅguttara, but nowhere else in the canon (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.32">AN 3.32</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an10.6">AN 10.6</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an10.7">AN 10.7</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an11.7">AN 11.7</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an11.18">AN 11.18</a>–<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an11.21">AN 11.21</a>). It begins with a question: could it be that a mendicant might attain a state of immersion that is free of all ego and conceit? Normally it is understood that the meditative absorptions are shared between ordinary people and enlightened beings on the path. The perfected ones are distinguished by having let go the cause of suffering, not because they have attained some special state of meditation. But these suttas, with their striking note of wonder, imply that there is a special meditative state attained only by the perfected ones.</p>
<p>This discourse is also distinguished by the fact that it finishes by quoting a verse currently included in the Sutta Nipāta and even correctly names the chapter, the “The Way to the Beyond”. It is not at all obvious that the verse was originally intended to refer to a state of meditation. This shows that free and imaginative readings of suttas were found even in the earliest times.</p>
<p>The next discourse (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.33">AN 3.33</a>) continues with the theme of going beyond ego and conceit, and it too quotes from “The Way to the Beyond”. But it starts with the Buddha in what appears to be an uncharacteristically despondent mood, saying that whether he teaches in brief or in detail—harking back to <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an2.11-20">AN 2.14</a>—it’s hard to find anyone who understands.</p>
<p><a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.35">AN 3.35</a> narrates a personal encounter with a fellow by the name of Hatthaka, who came across the Buddha meditating near his hometown of Āḷavī. He asks if the Buddha slept well, considering the harshness of his outdoor living. The Buddha replies that he is one of those who sleep well in the world, as he is rid of the greed, hate, and delusion that disturb people in their sleep.</p>
<p>This is the second time this classic triad appears in the Threes. They first appeared in the previous sutta, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.34">AN 3.34</a>, as the source of deeds, and will recur in this sense in multiple suttas in this <i lang="pli" translate="no">nipāta</i>. Like the triad of body, speech, and mind, they can be seen to exemplify the 2 + 1 pattern. Greed and hate are a codependent pair, the ugly opposites. Delusion underlies them both; but at the same time, the counterpart of delusion is wisdom, and it is through wisdom that transcendence is possible.</p>
<p>This narrative mood ventures into mythology in the next discourse, which gives the Buddhist account of the god Yama, lord of the dead. While one might expect a death god to be fearsome, here he takes a decidedly Buddhist approach to the afterlife. When the departed are brought to Yama, he neither judges nor punishes. Rather, he asks the departed whether he took heed of the messengers sent by the gods: an old person, a sick person, and a corpse. These, of course, are three of the four divine messengers seen by the Bodhisattva before he went forth (canonically found in the life of Vipassī; see <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/dn14">DN 14</a>). When the departed one replies that he took no heed, Yama castigates him for his negligence and then falls silent. The departed is dragged off to endure the sufferings of hell, here recounted in a briefer form than <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn129">MN 129</a> and <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/mn130">MN 130</a>. Yama goes on to lament the pitiful state of mortals, including himself and wishes he could be reborn as a human and practice Buddhism.</p>
<p>The mythological mood continues in the next couple of suttas (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.37">AN 3.37</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.38">AN 3.38</a>), which introduce a new topic that will be very important for the Aṅguttara; namely, the <i lang="pli" translate="no">uposatha</i> or “sabbath”. This was a special “holy day” for religious observance observed weekly or on certain special days. The ministers of the Four Great Kings survey the earth on such days to see if people are honoring their betters and doing good. If they are, they rejoice, for they know that such people will be reborn in heaven to swell the hosts of the gods, whereas if they are not they fear the hosts of the demons will increase. This will of course have serious military implications in the ongoing war between the two.</p>
<p>The next couple of suttas deal with renunciation, first as the Buddha’s recollection of his delicate upbringing (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.39">AN 3.39</a>), then as a reflection for how a renunciate is to reflect with integrity on their choices (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.40">AN 3.40</a>). <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.41">AN 3.41</a> and <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.42">AN 3.42</a> look at the other side of the coin, the qualities that make merit for a lay donor, especially faith and generosity as well as the desire to learn. Learning is taken up as the theme of the next two suttas (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.43">AN 3.43</a> and <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.44">AN 3.44</a>). Then the themes of generosity, faith, and the worthy spiritual life that make merit fruitful are revisited (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.45">AN 3.45</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.46">AN 3.46</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.48">AN 3.48</a>). Mendicants are then urged to be diligent (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.49">AN 3.49</a>) and the nature of bad mendicants is disclosed (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.50">AN 3.50</a>). Taken together, this series of 12 suttas can be read as a small thematic arc on the relation between lay folk and renunciants, the need for both to have integrity and the proper sense of values in their sphere, and the mutual support of each other through generosity with material things and of teachings.</p>
<p>Next begins a new <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i>, “On Brahmins”, which as one might expect, depicts the Buddha in conversation with brahmins. In <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.51">AN 3.51</a> and <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.52">AN 3.52</a>, the Buddha is approached by two brahmins, who confess that they have not lived a good life, and now, in their dotage, seek for help. The Buddha acknowledges the brevity of life and urges restraint of body, speech, and mind. <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.53">AN 3.53</a> has the Buddha speaking to another brahmin on how the Dhamma is to be realized in this very life. He gives a similar teaching to a wanderer (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.54">AN 3.54</a>) and to the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.55">AN 3.55</a>). That the Buddha’s teaching may be realized in this life is a stock characteristic of the Dhamma (<i lang="pli" translate="no">sandiṭṭhiko akāliko</i>), but it is easy to overlook how directly this was a rebuke of pre-existing religious traditions. They looked forward to rewards in the future—whether a heavenly rebirth or the eventual annihilation of suffering—but the Buddha, while not denying the reality and importance of future fruits, refocused spiritual life on the present.</p>
<p><a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.56">AN 3.56</a> gives a different kind of teaching to a brahmin. In a message with a special poignancy in our troubled times, the Buddha explains why civilizations collapse, namely, unbridled greed. In <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.57">AN 3.57</a> the Buddha refutes the wanderer Vacchagotta’s accusation that he only encourages giving to his followers. When the brahmin Tikaṇṇa (“Three-ear”) praises true brahmins, the Buddha responds with his redefinition of a brahmin, rejecting the value of birth and Vedic learning, and giving the second part of the Gradual Training, starting with the absorptions (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.58">AN 3.58</a>; <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.59">AN 3.59</a> is similar). In <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.60">AN 3.60</a>, the Buddha not only rejects the value of the Vedic sacrifice, but he also shows that by teaching Dhamma one can benefit many more people.</p>
<p>The seventh <i lang="pli" translate="no">vagga</i> is titled the “Great Chapter”, and it introduces a series of discourses on a larger scale. It begins with a thematic segue; <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.61">AN 3.61</a> continues the theme of the relation between Buddhist and non-Buddhist theories, but it does so as a straight doctrinal discourse to the mendicants, rather than as an interfaith dialogue. This magnificent discourse offers an important framing of dependent origination and it deserves detailed study. This Great Chapter is unified by the length of the sutta rather than by subject; however several other suttas deal with non-Buddhist philosophy and relations (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.64">AN 3.64</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.68">AN 3.68</a>, <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.70">AN 3.70</a>), including the famous Kālāma Sutta (<a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.65">AN 3.65</a>; also <a class="ref" href="https://suttacentral.net/an3.66">AN 3.66</a>).</p>
<p>Here I will end my analysis, as I think enough examples have been given to illustrate both the connectedness and the chaos of this collection. Hopefully, the reader can find their way from here, and not feel so bewildered by the sudden shifts and changes they encounter.</p>
<h2 id="intro-item5">A Brief Textual History</h2>
<p>The Aṅguttara Nikāya was edited by R. Morris (vols. 1 and 2) and E. Hardy (vols 3–5) based on manuscripts in Sinhalese and Burmese scripts; Hardy also made use of the then recently-published royal Thai edition. It was published in Latin script by the Pali Text Society from 1885 to 1900. Indexes by M. Hunt and Mrs. C.A.F. Rhys Davids were added in 1910. The first translation followed in 1932–36 by F.L. Woodward (vols. 1, 2, and 5) and E.M. Hare (vols. 3 and 4) under the title <cite class="book">The Book of the Gradual Sayings</cite>.</p>
<p>As was the case with the Majjhima and Saṁyutta, several disparate individual suttas from the Aṅguttara were published in book form or the web. However, a complete new translation had to wait for Bhikkhu Bodhi to complete his work on the Saṁyutta Nikāya. As described in the introduction to his translation, in the late 1990s Bhikkhu Bodhi collected Nyanaponika Thera’s four-part series of Wheel booklets into a single volume for the International Sacred Literature Trust as <cite class="book">An Aṅguttara Nikāya Anthology</cite>. He then added sixty more suttas and published a total of 208 suttas as <cite class="book">The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha: An Anthology of Suttas from the Aṅguttara Nikāya</cite> with AltaMira Press in 1999. In 2012 he completed the full translation, which was published as <cite class="book">The Numerical Discourses of the Buddha</cite> through Wisdom Publications. His Introduction was even more extensive than his previous works; less technical than the Saṁyutta introduction, the bulk of it focused on an overview of the teachings found in the Aṅguttara. As with his previous translations, this work constituted a major leap forward in accuracy and readability, introducing the Aṅguttara to a new generation.</p>
<p>Where the Pali was unclear I frequently referred to the earlier work of Bodhi, and rarely to Woodward/Hare and various translations of specific texts. An article by Tse-fu Kuan (<span lang="lzh" translate="no">關則富</span>)—<cite>Some Reflections on Translating the Pali Texts: Literary Conventions, Buddhist Thought, Cultural Background and Textual History</cite>, 2019, Acta Orientalia Academiae Scientiarum Hungaricae, vol. 72 (1), pp. 1–23—provided helpful corrections in several passages.</p>

<article id="an2.1">
<h5 class="sutta-title subheading">1. Faults </h5>
<p id="an2.1:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>
<p id="an2.1:1.5">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="an2.1:2.1">“There are, mendicants, these two faults. What two? The fault apparent in the present life, and the fault to do with lives to come. </p>
<p id="an2.1:2.4">What is the fault apparent in the present life? It’s when someone sees that kings have arrested a bandit, a criminal, and subjected them to various punishments—whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘Rāhu’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘bulrush twist’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded. </p>
<p id="an2.1:3.1">It occurs to them: ‘If I were to commit the kinds of bad deeds for which the kings arrested that bandit, that criminal, the rulers would arrest me and subject me to the same punishments. Afraid of the fault apparent in the present life, they do not steal the belongings of others. This is called the fault apparent in the present life. </p>
<p id="an2.1:4.1">What is the fault to do with lives to come? It’s when someone reflects: ‘Bad conduct of body, speech, or mind has a bad, painful result in the next life. If I conduct myself badly, then, when my body breaks up, after death, won’t I be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell?’ Afraid of the fault to do with lives to come, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure. This is called the fault to do with lives to come. </p>
<p id="an2.1:4.8">These are the two faults. </p>
<p id="an2.1:4.9">So you should train like this: ‘We will fear the fault apparent in the present life, and we will fear the fault to do with lives to come. We will fear faults, seeing the danger in faults.’ That’s how you should train. If you fear faults, seeing the danger in faults, you can expect to be freed from all faults.” </p>
</article>
<article id="an2.2">
<h5 class="sutta-title subheading">2. Endeavor </h5>
<p id="an2.2:1.1">“These two endeavors are challenging in the world. What two? The endeavor of laypeople staying in a home to provide robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. And the endeavor of those gone forth from the lay life to homelessness to let go of all attachments. These are the two endeavors that are challenging in the world. </p>
<p id="an2.2:2.1">The better of these two endeavors is the effort to let go of all attachments. </p>
<p id="an2.2:2.2">So you should train like this: ‘We shall endeavor to let go of all attachments.’ That’s how you should train.” </p>
</article>
<article id="an2.3">
<h5 class="sutta-title subheading">3. Mortifying </h5>
<p id="an2.3:1.1">“These two things, mendicants, are mortifying. What two? It’s when someone has done bad things and not done good things, by way of body, speech, and mind. Thinking, ‘I’ve done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind’, they’re mortified. Thinking, ‘I haven’t done good things by way of body, speech, and mind’, they’re mortified. These are the two things that are mortifying.” </p>
</article>
<article id="an2.4">
<h5 class="sutta-title subheading">4. Not Mortifying </h5>
<p id="an2.4:1.1">“These two things, mendicants, are not mortifying. What two? It’s when someone has done good things and not done bad things, by way of body, speech, and mind. Thinking, ‘I’ve done good things by way of body, speech, and mind’, they’re not mortified. Thinking, ‘I haven’t done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind’, they’re not mortified. These are the two things that are not mortifying.” </p>
</article>
<article id="an2.5">
<h5 class="sutta-title subheading">5. Learned for Myself </h5>
<p id="an2.5:1.1">“Mendicants, I have learned these two things for myself—to never be content with skillful qualities, and to never stop trying. </p>
<p id="an2.5:1.3">I never stopped trying, thinking: ‘Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.’ </p>
<p id="an2.5:1.5">It was by diligence that I achieved awakening, and by diligence that I achieved the supreme sanctuary from the yoke. </p>
<p id="an2.5:1.6">If you too never stop trying, thinking: ‘Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.’ You will soon realize the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. You will live having achieved with your own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="an2.5:1.9">So you should train like this: ‘We will never stop trying, thinking: “Gladly, let only skin, sinews, and bones remain! Let the flesh and blood waste away in my body! I will not stop trying until I have achieved what is possible by human strength, energy, and vigor.”’ That’s how you should train.” </p>

<h5 class="sutta-title subheading">6. Fetters </h5>
<p id="an2.6:1.1">“There are, mendicants, these two things. What two? Seeing things that are prone to being fettered as gratifying, and seeing things that are prone to being fettered as boring. When you keep seeing things that are prone to being fettered as gratifying, you don’t give up greed, hate, and delusion. When these are not given up, you’re not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. You’re not freed from suffering, I say. </p>
<p id="an2.6:2.1">When you keep seeing things that are prone to being fettered as boring, you give up greed, hate, and delusion.

<p id="an2.9:1.1">“These two bright things, mendicants, protect the world. What two? Conscience and prudence. If these two bright things did not protect the world, there would be no recognition of the status of mother, aunts, or wives and partners of teachers and respected people. The world would become dissolute, like goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, and dogs and jackals. But because the two bright things protect the world, there is recognition of the status of mother, aunts, and wives and partners of teachers and respected people.” </p>

It’s when someone reflects: ‘Bad conduct of body, speech, or mind has a bad, painful result in both this life and the next.’ Reflecting like this, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure. This is called the power of reflection. </p>
<p id="an2.11:2.1">And what, mendicants, is the power of development? In this context, the power of development is the power of the trainees.

<p id="an2.13:2.1">And what, mendicants, is the power of development? It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. This is called the power of development. These are the two powers.” </p>

But in a disciplinary issue, if both the offending mendicant and the accusing mendicant carefully check themselves, you can expect that issue won’t lead to lasting acrimony and enmity, and the mendicants will live comfortably. </p>
<p id="an2.15:2.1">And how, mendicants, does an offending mendicant carefully check themselves? An offending mendicant reflects: ‘I have committed a certain unskillful offense with the body. That mendicant saw me do this. If I hadn’t committed that offense, they wouldn’t have seen me. But since I did commit that offense, they did see me. When they saw me, they were upset, and they voiced their unhappiness to me. Then I also got upset, so I told others. So the mistake is mine alone, like someone who owes customs duty on their goods.’ That’s how, mendicants, an offending mendicant carefully checks themselves. </p>

<p id="an2.36:1.6">“Reverend,” they replied. Sāriputta said this: </p>
<p id="an2.36:1.8">“I will teach you about a person fettered internally and one fettered externally. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="an2.36:1.10">“Yes, reverend,” they replied. Sāriputta said this: </p>
<p id="an2.36:2.1">“Who is a person fettered internally? It’s a mendicant who is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in one of the orders of gods. When they pass away from there, they’re a returner, who comes back to this state of existence. This is called a person who is fettered internally, a returner, who comes back to this state of existence. </p>
<p id="an2.36:3.1">Who is a person fettered externally? It’s a mendicant who is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. They enter and remain in a certain peaceful state of freed mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in one of the orders of gods. When they pass away from there, they’re a non-returner, not coming back to this state of existence. This is called a person who is fettered externally, a non-returner, who does not come back to this state of existence. </p>
<p id="an2.36:4.1">Furthermore, a mendicant is ethical … they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. They simply practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding sensual pleasures. They simply practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding future lives. They practice for the ending of craving. They practice for the ending of greed. When their body breaks up, after death, they are reborn in one of the orders of gods. When they pass away from there, they are non-returners, not coming back to this state of existence. This is called a person who is fettered externally, a non-returner, who does not come back to this state of existence.” </p>
<p id="an2.36:5.1">Then several peaceful-minded deities went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to the Buddha, “Sir, Venerable Sāriputta is in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother, where he is teaching the mendicants about a person with internal fetters and one with external fetters. The assembly is overjoyed! Sir, please go to Venerable Sāriputta out of compassion.” The Buddha consented with silence. </p>
<p id="an2.36:5.6">Then the Buddha, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother, in front of Sāriputta. He sat on the seat spread out. Sāriputta bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: </p>
<p id="an2.36:6.1">“Just now, Sāriputta, several peaceful-minded deities came up to me, bowed, and stood to one side. Those deities said to me: ‘Sir, Venerable Sāriputta is in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother, where he is teaching the mendicants about a person with internal fetters and one with external fetters. The assembly is overjoyed! Sir, please go to Venerable Sāriputta out of compassion.’ </p>
<p id="an2.36:6.5">Those deities, though they number ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, or sixty, can stand on the point of a needle without bumping up against each other. </p>
<p id="an2.36:6.6">Sāriputta, you might think: ‘Surely those deities, since so many of them can stand on the point of a needle without bumping up against each other, must have developed their minds in that place.’ But you should not see it like this. It was right here that those deities developed their minds. </p>
<p id="an2.36:6.10">So you should train like this: ‘We shall have peaceful faculties and peaceful minds.’ That’s how you should train. When your faculties and mind are peaceful, your acts of body, speech, and mind will be peaceful, thinking: ‘We shall present the gift of peace to our spiritual companions.’ That’s how you should train. </p>

If an elder, though eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old, still dwells in the midst of sensual pleasures, enjoying them, consumed by thoughts of them, burning with fever for them, and eagerly seeking more, they are reckoned as a child, not a senior. If a youth, young, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life, does not dwell in the midst of sensual pleasures, enjoying them, consumed by thoughts of them, burning with fever for them, and eagerly seeking more, they are reckoned as astute, a senior.” </p>

<p id="an3.1:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>
<p id="an3.1:1.5">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="an3.1:2.1">“Whatever dangers there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute. Whatever perils there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute. Whatever hazards there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute. It’s like a fire that spreads from a hut made of reeds or grass, and burns down even a bungalow, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with latches fastened and windows shuttered. In the same way, whatever dangers there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute. Whatever perils there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute. Whatever hazards there are, all come from the foolish, not from the astute. </p>
<p id="an3.1:3.1">So, the fool is dangerous, but the astute person is safe. The fool is perilous, but the astute person is not. The fool is hazardous, but the astute person is not. There’s no danger, peril, or hazard that comes from the astute. </p>
<p id="an3.1:4.1">So you should train like this: ‘We will reject the three things by which a fool is known, and we will undertake and follow the three things by which an astute person is known.’ That’s how you should train.” </p>

<p id="an3.13:1.1">“These three kinds of people are found in the world. What three? The hopeless, the hopeful, and the one who has done away with hope. And what, mendicants, is a hopeless person? It’s when some person is reborn in a low family—a family of outcastes, bamboo-workers, hunters, chariot-makers, or waste-collectors—poor, with little to eat or drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find. And they’re ugly, unsightly, deformed, sickly—one-eyed, crippled, lame, or half-paralyzed. They don’t get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, fragrances, and makeup; or bed, house, and lighting. They hear this: ‘They say the aristocrats have anointed the aristocrat named so-and-so as king.’ It never occurs to them: ‘Oh, when will the aristocrats anoint me too as king?’ This is called a hopeless person. </p>
<p id="an3.13:2.1">And what, mendicants, is a hopeful person? It’s when some person is the eldest son of an anointed aristocratic king. He has not yet been anointed, but is eligible, and has been confirmed in the succession. He hears this: ‘They say that the aristocrats have anointed the aristocrat named so-and-so as king.’ It occurs to him: ‘Oh, when will the aristocrats anoint me too as king?’ This is called a hopeful person. </p>
<p id="an3.13:3.1">And what, mendicants, is a person who has done away with hope? It’s when a king has been anointed. He hears this: ‘They say that the aristocrats have anointed the aristocrat named so-and-so as king.’ It never occurs to him: ‘Oh, when will the aristocrats anoint me too as king?’ Why is that? Because the former hope he had to be anointed has now died down. This is called a person who has done away with hope. </p>
<p id="an3.13:3.10">These are the three kinds of people found in the world. </p>
<p id="an3.13:4.1">In the same way, these three kinds of people are found among the mendicants. What three? The hopeless, the hopeful, and the one who has done away with hope. And what, mendicants, is a hopeless person? It’s when some person is unethical, of bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual practitioner—though claiming to be one—rotten inside, corrupt, and depraved. They hear this: ‘They say that the mendicant named so-and-so has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ It never occurs to them: ‘Oh, when will I too realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ This is called a hopeless person. </p>

And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ It occurs to them: ‘Oh, when will I too realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ This is called a hopeful person. </p>
<p id="an3.13:6.1">And what, mendicants, is a person who has done away with hope? It’s when a mendicant is a perfected one, who has ended all defilements. They hear this: ‘They say that the mendicant named so-and-so has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ It never occurs to them: ‘Oh, when will I too realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ Why is that? Because the former hope they had to be freed has now died down. This is called a person who has done away with hope. </p>

<p id="an3.14:1.1">“Mendicants, even a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king, does not wield power without having their own king.” When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha: </p>
<p id="an3.14:1.3">“But who is the king of the wheel-turning monarch, the just and principled king?” </p>
<p id="an3.14:1.4">“It is principle, monk,” said the Buddha. </p>
<p id="an3.14:1.5">“Monk, a wheel-turning monarch provides just protection and security for his court, relying only on principle—honoring, respecting, and venerating principle, having principle as his flag, banner, and authority. </p>
<p id="an3.14:2.1">He provides just protection and security for his aristocrats, vassals, troops, brahmins and householders, people of town and country, ascetics and brahmins, beasts and birds. When he has done this, he wields power only in a principled manner. And this power cannot be undermined by any human enemy. </p>
<p id="an3.14:3.1">In the same way, monk, a Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, a just and principled king, provides just protection and security regarding bodily actions, relying only on principle—honoring, respecting, and venerating principle, having principle as his flag, banner, and authority. ‘This kind of bodily action should be cultivated. This kind of bodily action should not be cultivated.’ </p>
<p id="an3.14:4.1">Furthermore, a Realized One … provides just protection and security regarding verbal actions, saying: ‘This kind of verbal action should be cultivated. This kind of verbal action should not be cultivated.’ … And regarding mental actions: ‘This kind of mental action should be cultivated. This kind of mental action should not be cultivated.’ </p>
<p id="an3.14:5.1">And when a Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha has provided just protection and security regarding actions of body, speech, and mind, he rolls forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma. And that wheel cannot be rolled back by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world.” </p>

<p id="an3.15:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>
<p id="an3.15:1.4">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="an3.15:2.1">“Once upon a time there was a king named Pacetana. Then King Pacetana addressed his chariot-maker, ‘In six months’ time, my good chariot-maker, there will be a battle. Are you able to make me a new pair of wheels?’ </p>
<p id="an3.15:2.5">‘I can, Your Majesty,’ replied the chariot-maker. Then, when it was six days less than six months later, the chariot-maker had finished one wheel. </p>
<p id="an3.15:2.7">Then King Pacetana addressed his chariot-maker, ‘In six days’ time there will be a battle. Is my new pair of wheels finished?’ </p>
<p id="an3.15:2.9">‘Now that it is six days less than six months, Your Majesty, I have finished one wheel.’ </p>
<p id="an3.15:2.10">‘Are you able to finish the second wheel in these six days?’ </p>
<p id="an3.15:2.11">Saying, ‘I can, Your Majesty,’ the chariot-maker finished the second wheel in six days. Taking the pair of wheels he went up to King Pacetana, and said this to the king, ‘Your Majesty, these are your two new wheels, finished.’ </p>
<p id="an3.15:2.13">‘But, my good chariot-maker, what is the difference between the wheel that was finished in six days less than six months, and the wheel finished in just six days? Because I can’t see any difference between them.’ </p>
<p id="an3.15:2.15">‘But, Your Majesty, there is a difference. See now what it is.’ </p>
<p id="an3.15:3.1">Then the chariot-maker rolled forth the wheel that had been finished in six days. It rolled as far as the original impetus took it, then wobbled and fell down. Then he rolled forth the wheel that had been finished in six days less than six months. It rolled as far as the original impetus took it, then stood still as if fixed to an axle. </p>
<p id="an3.15:4.1">‘But what is the cause, my good chariot-maker, what is the reason why the wheel that was finished in six days wobbled and fell, while the one that was finished in six days less than six months stood still as if fixed to an axle?’ </p>
<p id="an3.15:4.3">‘The wheel that was finished in six days, Your Majesty, is crooked, flawed, and defective in rim, spoke, and hub. That’s why it wobbled and fell. The wheel that was finished in six days less than six months, Your Majesty, is not crooked, flawed, and defective in rim, spoke, and hub. That’s why it stood still as if fixed to an axle.’ </p>
<p id="an3.15:5.1">Now, mendicants, you might think: ‘Surely that chariot-maker must have been someone else at that time?’ But you should not see it like that. I myself was the chariot-maker at that time. Then I was skilled in the crooks, flaws, and defects of wood. </p>
<p id="an3.15:5.6">Now that I am a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, I am skilled in the crooks, flaws, and defects of actions by body, speech, and mind. Whatever monk or nun has not given up the crooks, flaws, and defects of body, speech, and mind has fallen from the teaching and training, just like the wheel that was finished in six days. </p>
<p id="an3.15:6.1">Whatever monk or nun has given up the crooks, flaws, and defects of body, speech, and mind is established in the teaching and training, just like the wheel that was finished in six days less than six months. </p>
<p id="an3.15:7.1">So you should train like this: ‘We will give up the crooks, flaws, and defects of body, speech, and mind.’ That’s how you should train.” </p>

<p id="an3.16:1.1">“Mendicants, when a mendicant has three things their practice is guaranteed, and they have laid the groundwork for ending the defilements. What three? It’s when a mendicant guards the sense doors, eats in moderation, and is dedicated to wakefulness. </p>
<p id="an3.16:2.1">And how does a mendicant guard the sense doors? When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint. When they hear a sound with their ears … When they smell an odor with their nose … When they taste a flavor with their tongue … When they feel a touch with their body … When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint. That’s how a mendicant guards the sense doors. </p>
<p id="an3.16:3.1">And how does a mendicant eat in moderation? It’s when a mendicant reflects rationally on the food that they eat: ‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’ That’s how a mendicant eats in moderation. </p>
<p id="an3.16:4.1">And how is a mendicant dedicated to wakefulness? It’s when a mendicant practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying their mind from obstacles. In the evening, they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation. In the middle of the night, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. In the last part of the night, they get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying their mind from obstacles. This is how a mendicant is dedicated to wakefulness. </p>

<p id="an3.35:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Āḷavī, on a mat of leaves by a cow-path in a grove of Indian Rosewood. </p>
<p id="an3.35:1.3">Then as Hatthaka of Āḷavī was going for a walk he saw the Buddha sitting on that mat of leaves. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said, “Sir, I trust the Buddha slept well?” </p>
<p id="an3.35:1.6">“Yes, prince, I slept well. I am one of those who sleep at ease in the world.” </p>
<p id="an3.35:2.1">“The winter nights are cold, sir, and it’s the week of mid-winter, when the snow falls. Rough is the ground trampled under the cows’ hooves, and thin is the mat of leaves. The leaves are sparse on the trees, the ocher robes are cold, and cold blows the north wind. And yet the Buddha says, ‘Yes, prince, I slept well. I am one of those who sleep at ease in the world.’” </p>
<p id="an3.35:3.1">“Well then, prince, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. What do you think? Take the case of a householder or his son, who lives in a bungalow, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with latches fastened and windows shuttered. His couch is spread with woolen covers—shag-piled, pure white, or embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide. It has a canopy above and red pillows at both ends. An oil lamp is burning there, while his four wives attend to him in all manner of agreeable ways. What do you think, prince, would he sleep at ease, or not? Or how do you see this?” </p>
<p id="an3.35:3.8">“He would sleep at ease, sir. Of those who sleep at ease in the world, he would be one.” </p>
<p id="an3.35:4.1">“What do you think, prince? Is it not possible that a fever born of greed—physical or mental—might arise in that householder or householder’s son, burning him so he sleeps badly?” </p>
<p id="an3.35:4.3">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an3.35:5.1">“The greed that burns that householder or householder’s son, making them sleep badly, has been cut off at the root by the Realized One, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. That’s why I sleep at ease. </p>
<p id="an3.35:6.1">What do you think, prince? Is it not possible that a fever born of hate … or a fever born of delusion—physical or mental—might arise in that householder or householder’s son, burning him so he sleeps badly?” </p>
<p id="an3.35:6.4">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an3.35:7.1">“The delusion that burns that householder or householder’s son, making them sleep badly, has been cut off at the root by the Realized One, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. That’s why I sleep at ease. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an3.35:8.1">A brahmin who is fully extinguished <br/>always sleeps at ease. <br/>Sensual pleasures slip off them, <br/>they’re cooled, free of attachments. </p>

<h4 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">AN 3.36</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">Messengers of the Gods </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Devadūtasutta</span></h4>
<p id="an3.36:1.1">“There are, mendicants, these three messengers of the gods. What three? </p>
<p id="an3.36:1.3">Firstly, someone does bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. Then the wardens of hell take them by the arms and present them to King Yama, saying: ‘Your Majesty, this person did not pay due respect to their mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, or honor the elders in the family. May Your Majesty punish them!’ </p>
<p id="an3.36:2.1">Then King Yama pursues, presses, and grills them about the first messenger of the gods: ‘Mister, did you not see the first messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’ </p>
<p id="an3.36:2.3">They say, ‘I saw nothing, sir.’ </p>
<p id="an3.36:3.1">Then King Yama says, ‘Mister, did you not see among human beings an elderly woman or a man—eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old—bent double, crooked, leaning on a staff, trembling as they walk, ailing, past their prime, with teeth broken, hair grey and scanty or bald, skin wrinkled, and limbs blotchy?’ </p>
<p id="an3.36:3.3">They say, ‘I saw that, sir.’ </p>
<p id="an3.36:4.1">Then King Yama says, ‘Mister, did it not occur to you—being sensible and mature—“I, too, am liable to grow old. I’m not exempt from old age. I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’ </p>
<p id="an3.36:4.4">They say, ‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’ </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an3.36:5.1">Then King Yama says, ‘Mister, because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind. Indeed, they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence. That bad deed wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by the deities, or by ascetics and brahmins. That bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’ </p>
<p id="an3.36:6.1">Then King Yama grills them about the second messenger of the gods: ‘Mister, did you not see the second messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’ </p>
<p id="an3.36:6.3">They say, ‘I saw nothing, sir.’ Then King Yama says, ‘Mister, did you not see among human beings a woman or a man, sick, suffering, gravely ill, collapsed in their own urine and feces, being picked up by some and put down by others?’ </p>
<p id="an3.36:6.7">They say, ‘I saw that, sir.’ </p>
<p id="an3.36:7.1">Then King Yama says, ‘Mister, did it not occur to you—being sensible and mature—“I, too, am liable to become sick. I’m not exempt from sickness. I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’ </p>
<p id="an3.36:7.4">They say, ‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’ </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an3.36:8.1">Then King Yama says, ‘Mister, because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind. Well, they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence. That bad deed wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by the deities, or by ascetics and brahmins. That bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’ </p>
<p id="an3.36:9.1">Then King Yama grills them about the third messenger of the gods: ‘Mister, did you not see the third messenger of the gods that appeared among human beings?’ </p>
<p id="an3.36:9.3">They say, ‘I saw nothing, sir.’ </p>
<p id="an3.36:10.1">Then King Yama says, ‘Mister, did you not see among human beings a woman or a man, dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering?’ </p>
<p id="an3.36:10.3">They say, ‘I saw that, sir.’ </p>
<p id="an3.36:11.1">Then King Yama says, ‘Mister, did it not occur to you—being sensible and mature—“I, too, am liable to die. I’m not exempt from death. I’d better do good by way of body, speech, and mind”?’ </p>
<p id="an3.36:11.4">They say, ‘I couldn’t, sir. I was negligent.’ </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an3.36:12.1">Then King Yama says, ‘Mister, because you were negligent, you didn’t do good by way of body, speech, and mind. Well, they’ll definitely punish you to fit your negligence. That bad deed wasn’t done by your mother, father, brother, or sister. It wasn’t done by friends and colleagues, by relatives and kin, by the deities, or by ascetics and brahmins. That bad deed was done by you alone, and you alone will experience the result.’ </p>
<p id="an3.36:13.1">Then, after grilling them about the third messenger of the gods, King Yama falls silent. Then the wardens of hell punish them with the five-fold crucifixion. They drive red-hot stakes through the hands and feet, and another in the middle of the chest. And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated. </p>
<p id="an3.36:14.1">Then the wardens of hell throw them down and hack them with axes. … </p>
<p id="an3.36:15.1">They hang them upside-down and hack them with hatchets. … </p>
<p id="an3.36:15.2">They harness them to a chariot, and drive them back and forth across burning ground, blazing and glowing. … </p>
<p id="an3.36:15.3">They make them climb up and down a huge mountain of burning coals, blazing and glowing. … </p>
<p id="an3.36:15.4">Then the wardens of hell turn them upside down and throw them in a red-hot copper pot, burning, blazing, and glowing. There they’re seared in boiling scum, and they’re swept up and down and round and round. And there they suffer painful, sharp, severe, acute feelings—but they don’t die until that bad deed is eliminated. Then the wardens of hell toss them into the Great Hell. </p>
<p id="an3.36:15.8">Now, about that Great Hell: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an3.36:16.1">‘Four are its corners, four its doors, <br/>neatly divided in equal parts. <br/>Surrounded by an iron wall, <br/>of iron is its roof. </p>
<p id="an3.36:17.1">The ground is even made of iron, <br/>it burns with fierce fire. <br/>The heat forever radiates <br/>a hundred leagues around.’ </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="an3.36:18.1">Once upon a time, King Yama thought, ‘Those who do such bad deeds in the world receive these many different punishments. Oh, I hope I may be reborn as a human being! And that a Realized One—a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha—arises in the world! And that I may pay homage to the Buddha! Then the Buddha can teach me Dhamma, so that I may understand his teaching.’ </p>
<p id="an3.36:18.5">Now, I don’t say this because I’ve heard it from some other ascetic or brahmin. I only say it because I’ve known, seen, and realized it for myself. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an3.36:19.1">Those people who are negligent, <br/>when warned by the gods’ messengers: <br/>a long time they sorrow, <br/>when they go to that wretched place. </p>
<p id="an3.36:20.1">But those good and peaceful people, <br/>when warned by the god’s messengers, <br/>never neglect <br/>the teaching of the noble ones. </p>
<p id="an3.36:21.1">Seeing the peril in grasping, <br/>the origin of birth and death, <br/>the unattached are freed <br/>with the ending of birth and death. </p>
<p id="an3.36:22.1">Happy, they’ve come to a safe place, <br/>extinguished in this very life. <br/>They’ve gone beyond all threats and perils, <br/>and risen above all suffering.” </p>

<p id="an3.39:1.1">“My lifestyle was delicate, mendicants, most delicate, extremely delicate. </p>
<p id="an3.39:1.2">In my father’s home, lotus ponds were made just for me. In some, blue water lilies blossomed, while in others, there were pink or white lotuses, just for my benefit. I only used sandalwood from Kāsi, and my turbans, jackets, sarongs, and upper robes also came from Kāsi. And a white parasol was held over me night and day, with the thought: ‘Don’t let cold, heat, grass, dust, or damp bother him.’ </p>
<p id="an3.39:2.1">I had three stilt longhouses—one for the winter, one for the summer, and one for the rainy season. I stayed in a stilt longhouse without coming downstairs for the four months of the rainy season, where I was entertained by musicians—none of them men. </p>
<p id="an3.39:2.3">While the bondservants, workers, and staff in other houses are given rough gruel with pickles to eat, in my father’s home they are given fine rice with meat. </p>
<p id="an3.39:3.1">Amid such prosperity and such a delicate lifestyle, I thought: ‘When an unlearned ordinary person—who is liable to grow old, not being exempt from old age—sees someone else who is old, they’re horrified, repelled, and disgusted, overlooking the fact that they themselves are in the same situation. But since I, too, am liable to grow old, it would not be appropriate for me to be horrified, embarrassed, and disgusted, when I see someone else who is old.’ Reflecting like this, I entirely gave up the vanity of youth. </p>

But I was swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I was swamped by suffering, mired in suffering.

And I thought, “Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.” And now, since I’ve now gone forth, I might have sensual, malicious, or cruel thoughts. But the population of the world is large, and there are ascetics and brahmins who have psychic power—they’re clairvoyant, and can read the minds of others.

<p id="an3.58:4.1">“Brahmin, it’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. </p>
<p id="an3.58:5.1">When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives. They recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. This is the first knowledge that they attain. Ignorance is destroyed and knowledge has arisen; darkness is destroyed and light has arisen, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute. </p>
<p id="an3.58:6.1">When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings. With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. This is the second knowledge that they attain. Ignorance is destroyed and knowledge has arisen; darkness is destroyed and light has arisen, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute. </p>
<p id="an3.58:7.1">When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements. They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’. Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. </p>
<p id="an3.58:7.6">They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ This is the third knowledge that they attain. Ignorance is destroyed and knowledge has arisen; darkness is destroyed, and light has arisen, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute. </p>

He recites and remembers the hymns, and has mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth.

<h4 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">AN 3.60</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">With Saṅgārava </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Saṅgāravasutta</span></h4>
<p id="an3.60:1.1">Then Saṅgārava the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="an3.60:1.3">“Master Gotama, we who are called brahmins make sacrifices and encourage others to make sacrifices. Now, Master Gotama, both of these people—the one who sacrifices and the one who encourages others to sacrifice—are doing good for many people on account of that sacrifice. But, Master Gotama, when someone has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness, they tame, calm, and extinguish themselves alone. That being so, they are doing good for just one person on account of that going forth.” </p>
<p id="an3.60:2.1">“Well then, brahmin, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. What do you think, brahmin? A Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. He says, ‘Come, this is the path, this is the practice. Practicing like this, I realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual life with my own insight, and I make it known. Please, all of you, practice like this, and you too will realize the supreme culmination of the spiritual life, and will live having realized it with your own insight.’ So the teacher teaches Dhamma, and others practice accordingly, in their hundreds and thousands, and hundreds of thousands. </p>
<p id="an3.60:3.1">What do you think, brahmin? This being so, are they doing good for just one person or for many people on account of going forth?” </p>
<p id="an3.60:3.3">“This being so, Master Gotama, they are doing good for many people on account of going forth.” </p>
<p id="an3.60:4.1">When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to Saṅgārava, “Brahmin, which of these two practices do you believe has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?” </p>
<p id="an3.60:4.3">Saṅgārava said to Ānanda, “Those such as the masters Gotama and Ānanda are honored and praised by me!” </p>
<p id="an3.60:5.1">For a second time, Ānanda said to Saṅgārava, “Brahmin, I didn’t ask you who you honor and praise. I asked you which of these two practices do you believe has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?” </p>
<p id="an3.60:5.6">For a second time Saṅgārava said to Ānanda, “Those such as the masters Gotama and Ānanda are honored and praised by me!” </p>
<p id="an3.60:6.1">For a third time, Ānanda said to Saṅgārava, “Brahmin, I didn’t ask you who you honor and praise. I asked you which of these two practices do you believe has fewer requirements and undertakings, yet is more fruitful and beneficial?” </p>
<p id="an3.60:6.6">For a third time Saṅgārava said to Ānanda, “Those such as the masters Gotama and Ānanda are honored and praised by me!” </p>
<p id="an3.60:7.1">Then it occurred to the Buddha, “Though Ānanda asked him a sensible question three times, Saṅgārava falters without answering. Why don’t I give him a way out?” </p>
<p id="an3.60:7.4">So the Buddha said to Saṅgārava, “Brahmin, what came up in the conversation among the king’s retinue today, sitting together in the royal compound?” </p>
<p id="an3.60:7.6">“Master Gotama, this came up: ‘Formerly, it seems, there were fewer mendicants, but more of them displayed superhuman demonstrations of psychic power; while these days, there are more mendicants, but fewer display superhuman demonstrations of psychic power.’ This is what came up in the conversation among the king’s retinue today, while sitting together in the royal compound.” </p>
<p id="an3.60:8.1">“Brahmin, there are three kinds of demonstration. What three? A demonstration of psychic power, a demonstration of revealing, and a demonstration of instruction. </p>
<p id="an3.60:8.4">And what is the demonstration of psychic power? It’s when someone wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. They control the body as far as the Brahmā realm. This is called the demonstration of psychic power. </p>
<p id="an3.60:9.1">And what is the demonstration of revealing? In one case, someone reveals by means of a sign: ‘This is what you’re thinking, such is your thought, and thus is your state of mind.’ And even if they reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise. </p>
<p id="an3.60:10.1">In another case, someone reveals after hearing it from humans or non-humans or deities: ‘This is what you’re thinking, such is your thought, and thus is your state of mind.’ And even if they reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise. </p>
<p id="an3.60:11.1">In another case, someone reveals by hearing the sound of thought spreading as someone thinks and considers: ‘This is what you’re thinking, such is your thought, and thus is your state of mind.’ And even if they reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise. </p>
<p id="an3.60:12.1">In another case, someone comprehends the mind of a person who has attained the immersion that’s free of placing the mind and keeping it connected. They understand: ‘Judging by the way this person’s intentions are directed, immediately after this mind state, they’ll think this thought.’ And even if they reveal this many times, it turns out exactly so, not otherwise. This is called the demonstration of revealing. </p>
<p id="an3.60:13.1">And what is a demonstration of instruction? It’s when someone instructs others like this: ‘Think like this, not like that. Focus your mind like this, not like that. Give up this, and live having achieved that.’ This is called a demonstration of instruction. </p>
<p id="an3.60:13.5">These are the three kinds of demonstration. Of these three kinds of demonstration, which do you consider to be the finest?” </p>
<p id="an3.60:14.1">“Regarding this, Master Gotama, a demonstration of psychic power is experienced only by the one who performs it, occurring only to them. This seems to me like a magic trick. </p>
<p id="an3.60:15.1">And the demonstration where someone reveals something by means of a sign, or after hearing it from humans, non-humans, or deities, or by hearing the sound of thought spreading as someone thinks and considers, or by comprehending the mind of another person, is also experienced only by the one who performs it, occurring only to them. This also seems to me like a magic trick. </p>
<p id="an3.60:16.1">But as to the demonstration where someone instructs others: ‘Think like this, not like that. Focus your mind like this, not like that. Give up this, and live having achieved that.’ I prefer this demonstration, Master Gotama. It’s the finest of the three kinds of demonstration. </p>
<p id="an3.60:17.1">It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing, how well this was said by Master Gotama. We regard Master Gotama as someone who possesses these three kinds of demonstration. For Master Gotama wields the many kinds of psychic power … controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm. And Master Gotama comprehends the mind of another person who has attained the immersion that is free of placing the mind and keeping it connected. He understands: ‘Judging by the way this person’s intentions are directed, immediately after this mind state they’ll think this thought.’ And Master Gotama instructs others like this: ‘Think like this, not like that. Focus your mind like this, not like that. Give up this, and live having achieved that.’” </p>
<p id="an3.60:18.1">“Your words are clearly invasive and intrusive, brahmin. Nevertheless, I will answer you. For I do wield the many kinds of psychic power … controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm. And I do comprehend the mind of another person who has attained the immersion that is free of placing the mind and keeping it connected. I understand: ‘Judging by the way this person’s intentions are directed, immediately after this mind state they’ll think this thought.’ And I do instruct others like this: ‘Think like this, not like that. Focus your mind like this, not like that. Give up this, and live having achieved that.’” </p>
<p id="an3.60:19.1">“But Master Gotama, is there even one other mendicant who possesses these three kinds of demonstration, apart from Master Gotama?” </p>
<p id="an3.60:19.2">“There’s not just one hundred mendicants, brahmin, who possess these three kinds of demonstration, nor two, three, four, or five hundred, but many more than that.” </p>
<p id="an3.60:19.3">“But where are these mendicants now staying?” </p>
<p id="an3.60:19.4">“Right here, brahmin, in this Saṅgha of mendicants.” </p>
<p id="an3.60:20.1">“Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>

Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; association with the disliked is suffering; separation from the liked is suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering. This is called the noble truth of suffering. </p>
<p id="an3.61:15.1">And what is the noble truth of the origin of suffering? Ignorance is a condition for choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. This is called the noble truth of the origin of suffering. </p>
<p id="an3.61:16.1">And what is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering? When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases. This is called the noble truth of the cessation of suffering. </p>
<p id="an3.61:17.1">And what is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering? It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. This is called the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. </p>
<p id="an3.61:17.5">‘“These are the four noble truths”: this is the Dhamma I’ve taught that is irrefutable, uncorrupted, beyond reproach, and is not scorned by sensible ascetics and brahmins.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.” </p>

<h4 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">AN 3.63</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">At Venāgapura </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Venāgapurasutta</span></h4>
<p id="an3.63:1.1">At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Venāgapura. The brahmins and householders of Venāgapura heard: </p>
<p id="an3.63:1.3">“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Venāgapura. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.” </p>
<p id="an3.63:2.1">Then the brahmins and householders of Venāgapura went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Then the brahmin Vacchagotta of Venāgapura said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="an3.63:3.1">“It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing, how your faculties are so very clear, and the complexion of your skin is pure and bright. It’s like a golden brown jujube in the autumn, or a palm fruit freshly plucked from the stalk, or a pendant of river gold, fashioned by a deft smith, well-wrought in the forge, and placed on a cream rug where it shines and glows and radiates. In the same way, your faculties are so very clear, and the complexion of your skin is pure and bright. </p>
<p id="an3.63:3.9">Surely Master Gotama gets when he wants, without trouble or difficulty, various kinds of high and luxurious bedding, such as: sofas, couches, woolen covers—shag-piled, colorful, white, embroidered with flowers, quilted, embroidered with animals, double-or single-fringed—and silk covers studded with gems, as well as silken sheets, woven carpets, rugs for elephants, horses, or chariots, antelope hide rugs, and spreads of fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red cushions at both ends.” </p>
<p id="an3.63:4.1">“Brahmin, these various kinds of high and luxurious bedding are hard for renunciates to find. And even if they do get them, they’re not allowed. </p>
<p id="an3.63:5.1">There are, brahmin, these three high and luxurious beds that I get these days when I want, without trouble or difficulty. What three? The heavenly high and luxurious bed, the divine high and luxurious bed, and the noble high and luxurious bed. These are the three high and luxurious beds that I get these days when I want, without trouble or difficulty.” </p>
<p id="an3.63:6.1">“But what, Master Gotama, is the heavenly high and luxurious bed?” </p>
<p id="an3.63:6.2">“Brahmin, when I am living supported by a village or town, I robe up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, enter the town or village for alms. After the meal, on my return from almsround, I enter within a forest. I gather up some grass or leaves into a pile and sit down cross-legged, setting my body straight, and establishing mindfulness in front of me. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, I enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, I enter and remain in the third absorption, where I meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. When I’m practicing like this, if I walk, at that time my walking is heavenly. When I’m practicing like this, if I stand, at that time my standing is heavenly. When I’m practicing like this, if I sit, at that time my sitting is heavenly. When I’m practicing like this, if I lie down, at that time my lying is heavenly. This is the heavenly high and luxurious bed that I get these days when I want, without trouble or difficulty.” </p>
<p id="an3.63:7.1">“It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing! Who but Master Gotama could get such a heavenly high and luxurious bed when he wants, without trouble or difficulty? </p>
<p id="an3.63:8.1">But what, Master Gotama, is the divine high and luxurious bed?” </p>
<p id="an3.63:8.2">“Brahmin, when I am living supported by a village or town, I robe up in the morning and, taking my bowl and robe, enter the town or village for alms. After the meal, on my return from almsround, I enter within a forest. I gather up some grass or leaves into a pile and sit down cross-legged, setting my body straight, and establishing mindfulness in front of me. I meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, I spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. I meditate spreading a heart full of compassion to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, I spread a heart full of compassion to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. I meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth.

As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. We go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<h4 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">AN 3.64</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">With Sarabha </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Sarabhasutta</span></h4>
<p id="an3.64:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. </p>
<p id="an3.64:1.3">Now at that time a wanderer called Sarabha had recently left this teaching and training. He was telling a crowd in Rājagaha, “I learned the teaching of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan, then I left their teaching and training.” </p>
<p id="an3.64:1.7">Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Rājagaha for alms. They heard what Sarabha was saying. </p>
<p id="an3.64:2.1">Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “The wanderer called Sarabha has recently left this teaching and training. He was telling a crowd in Rājagaha: ‘I learned the teaching of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan, then I left their teaching and training.’ Sir, please go to the wanderers’ monastery on the banks of the Sappinī river to see Sarabha the wanderer out of compassion.” The Buddha consented with silence. </p>
<p id="an3.64:3.1">Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the wanderers’ monastery on the banks of the Sappinī river to visit Sarabha the wanderer. He sat on the seat spread out, and said to the wanderer Sarabha, “Is it really true, Sarabha, that you’ve been saying: ‘I learned the teaching of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan, then I left their teaching and training.’” When he said this, Sarabha kept silent. </p>
<p id="an3.64:4.1">For a second time, the Buddha said to Sarabha, “Tell me, Sarabha, what exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan? If you’ve not learned it fully, I’ll fill you in. But if you have learned it fully, I’ll agree.” For a second time, Sarabha kept silent. </p>
<p id="an3.64:5.1">For a third time, the Buddha said to Sarabha, “Sarabha, the teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan are clear to me. What exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan? If you’ve not learned it fully, I’ll fill you in. But if you have learned it fully, I’ll agree.” For a third time, Sarabha kept silent. </p>
<p id="an3.64:6.1">Then those wanderers said to Sarabha, “The ascetic Gotama has offered to tell you anything you ask for. Speak, reverend Sarabha, what exactly have you learned of the teachings of the ascetics who follow the Sakyan? If you’ve not learned it fully, he’ll fill you in. But if you have learned it fully, he’ll agree.” When this was said, Sarabha sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say. </p>
<p id="an3.64:7.1">Knowing this, the Buddha said to the wanderers: </p>
<p id="an3.64:8.1">“Wanderers, someone might say to me: ‘You claim to be a fully awakened Buddha, but you don’t understand these things.’ Then I’d carefully pursue, press, and grill them on that point. When grilled by me, they would, without a doubt, fall into one of these three categories. They’d dodge the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points. They’d display annoyance, hate, and bitterness. Or they’d sit silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say, like Sarabha. </p>
<p id="an3.64:9.1">Wanderers, someone might say to me: ‘You claim to have ended all defilements, but you still have these defilements.’ Then I’d carefully pursue, press, and grill them on that point. When grilled by me, they would, without a doubt, fall into one of these three categories. They’d dodge the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points. They’d display annoyance, hate, and bitterness. Or they’d sit silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say, like Sarabha. </p>
<p id="an3.64:10.1">Wanderers, someone might say to me: ‘Your teaching does not lead someone who practices it to the complete ending of suffering, the goal for which it is taught.’ Then I’d carefully pursue, press, and grill them on that point. When grilled by me, they would, without a doubt, fall into one of these three categories. They’d dodge the issue, distracting the discussion with irrelevant points. They’d display annoyance, hate, and bitterness. Or they’d sit silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say, like Sarabha.” </p>
<p id="an3.64:10.4">Then the Buddha, having roared his lion’s roar three times in the wanderers’ monastery on the bank of the Sappinī river, rose into the sky and flew away. </p>
<p id="an3.64:11.1">Soon after the Buddha left, those wanderers beset Sarabha on all sides with sneering and jeering. “Reverend Sarabha, you’re just like an old jackal in the formidable wilderness who thinks, ‘I’ll roar a lion’s roar!’ but they still only manage to squeal and yelp like a jackal. In the same way, when the ascetic Gotama wasn’t here you said ‘I’ll roar a lion’s roar!’ but you only managed to squeal and yelp like a jackal. </p>
<p id="an3.64:11.4">You’re just like a golden oriole who thinks, ‘I’ll cry like a cuckoo!’ but they still only manage to cry like a golden oriole. In the same way, when the ascetic Gotama wasn’t here you said ‘I’ll cry like a cuckoo!’ but you still only managed to cry like a golden oriole. </p>
<p id="an3.64:11.6">You’re just like a bull that thinks to bellow only when the cowstall is empty. In the same way, you only thought to bellow when the ascetic Gotama wasn’t here.” That’s how those wanderers beset Sarabha on all sides with sneering and jeering. </p>

<p id="an3.65:3.1">“There are, sir, some ascetics and brahmins who come to Kesamutta.

So, sir, we’re doubting and uncertain: ‘I wonder who of these respected ascetics and brahmins speaks the truth, and who speaks falsehood?’” </p>
<p id="an3.65:3.7">“It is enough, Kālāmas, for you to be doubting and uncertain. Doubt has come up in you about an uncertain matter. </p>
<p id="an3.65:4.1">Please, Kālāmas, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But when you know for yourselves: ‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering’, then you should give them up. </p>
<p id="an3.65:5.1">What do you think, Kālāmas? Does greed come up in a person for their welfare or harm?” </p>
<p id="an3.65:6.1">“Harm, sir.” </p>
<p id="an3.65:7.1">“A greedy individual, overcome by greed, kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?” </p>
<p id="an3.65:8.1">“Yes, sir.” </p>

<p id="an3.65:41.1">“So, Kālāmas, when I said: ‘Please, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think “The ascetic is our respected teacher.” But when you know for yourselves: </p>

<p id="an3.67:1.1">“There are, mendicants, these three topics of discussion. What three? You might discuss the past: ‘That is how it was in the past.’ You might discuss the future: ‘That is how it will be in the future.’ Or you might discuss the present: ‘This is how it is at present.’ </p>
<p id="an3.67:2.1">You can know whether or not a person is competent to hold a discussion by seeing how they take part in a discussion. When a person is asked a question, if it needs to be answered definitively and they don’t answer it definitively; or if it needs analysis and they answer without analyzing it; or if it needs a counter-question and they answer without a counter-question; or if it should be set aside and they don’t set it aside, then that person is not competent to hold a discussion.

When a person is asked a question, if they’re not consistent about what their position is and what it isn’t; about what they propose; about speaking from what they know; and about the appropriate procedure, then that person is not competent to hold a discussion. When a person is asked a question, if they are consistent about what their position is and what it isn’t; about what they propose; about speaking from what they know; and about the appropriate procedure, then that person is competent to hold a discussion. </p>
<p id="an3.67:4.1">You can know whether or not a person is competent to hold a discussion by seeing how they take part in a discussion.

<p id="an3.67:5.1">You can know whether or not a person is competent to hold a discussion by seeing how they take part in a discussion. When a person is asked a question, if they intimidate, crush, mock, or seize on trivial mistakes, then that person is not competent to hold a discussion. When a person is asked a question, if they don’t intimidate, crush, mock, or seize on trivial mistakes, then that person is competent to hold a discussion. </p>
<p id="an3.67:6.1">You can know whether or not a person has what’s required by seeing how they take part in a discussion. If they actively listen they have what’s required; if they don’t actively listen they don’t have what’s required. Someone who has what’s required directly knows one thing, completely understands one thing, gives up one thing, and realizes one thing—and then they experience complete freedom. This is the purpose of discussion, consultation, the requirements, and listening well, that is, the liberation of the mind by not grasping. </p>

<p id="an3.69:1.1">“Mendicants, there are these three unskillful roots. What three? Greed, hate, and delusion. </p>
<p id="an3.69:2.1">Greed is a root of the unskillful. When a greedy person chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is unskillful. When a greedy person, overcome by greed, causes another to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want power’, that too is unskillful. And so these many bad, unskillful things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and conditioned by greed. </p>
<p id="an3.69:3.1">Hate is a root of the unskillful. When a hateful person chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is unskillful. When a hateful person, overcome by hate, causes another to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want power’, that too is unskillful. And so these many bad, unskillful things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and conditioned by hate. </p>
<p id="an3.69:4.1">Delusion is a root of the unskillful. When a deluded person chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is unskillful. When a deluded person, overcome by delusion, causes another to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want power’, that too is unskillful. And so these many bad, unskillful things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and conditioned by delusion. Such a person is said to have speech that’s ill-timed, false, meaningless, not in line with the teaching and training. </p>
<p id="an3.69:5.1">Why is this? This person causes another to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want power’. So when someone makes a valid criticism, they’re scornful and admit nothing. When someone makes a baseless criticism, they make no effort to explain, ‘This is why that’s untrue, this is why that’s false.’ That’s why such a person is said to have speech that’s ill-timed, false, meaningless, not in line with the teaching and training. </p>
<p id="an3.69:6.1">Such a person—overcome with bad, unskillful qualities born of greed, hate, and delusion—suffers in the present life, with anguish, distress, and fever. And when the body breaks up, after death, they can expect to be reborn in a bad place. </p>
<p id="an3.69:7.1">Suppose a sal, axlewood, or boxwood tree was choked and engulfed by three camel’s foot creepers. It would fall to ruin and disaster.

<p id="an3.69:8.1">These are the three unskillful roots. </p>
<p id="an3.69:9.1">There are these three skillful roots. What three? Contentment, love, and understanding. </p>
<p id="an3.69:10.1">Contentment is a root of the skillful. When a contented person chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is skillful. When a contented person, not overcome by greed, doesn’t cause another to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want power’, that too is skillful. And so these many skillful things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and conditioned by contentment. </p>
<p id="an3.69:11.1">Love is a root of the skillful. When a loving person chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is skillful. When a loving person, not overcome by hate, doesn’t cause another to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want power’, that too is skillful. And so these many skillful things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and conditioned by love. </p>
<p id="an3.69:12.1">Understanding is a root of the skillful. When an understanding person chooses to act by way of body, speech, or mind, that too is skillful. When an understanding person, not overcome by delusion, doesn’t cause another to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want power’, that too is skillful. And so these many skillful things are produced in them, born, sourced, originated, and conditioned by understanding. Such a person is said to have speech that’s well-timed, true, meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. </p>
<p id="an3.69:13.1">Why is this? This person doesn’t cause another to suffer under a false pretext—by execution or imprisonment or confiscation or condemnation or banishment—thinking ‘I’m powerful, I want power’.

<p id="an3.69:14.1">For such a person, bad unskillful qualities born of greed, hate, and delusion are cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. In the present life they’re happy, free of anguish, distress, and fever, and they’re also extinguished in the present life. </p>
<p id="an3.69:15.1">Suppose a sal, axlewood, or boxwood tree was choked and engulfed by three camel’s foot creepers. Then along comes a person with a spade and basket. They’d cut the creeper out by the roots, dig them up, and pull them out, down to the fibers and stems. Then they’d split the creeper apart, cut up the parts, and chop it into splinters. They’d dry the splinters in the wind and sun, burn them with fire, and reduce them to ashes. Then they’d sweep away the ashes in a strong wind, or float them away down a swift stream. In the same way, for such a person, bad unskillful qualities born of greed, hate, and delusion are cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.

<p id="an3.70:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. </p>
<p id="an3.70:1.3">Then Visākhā, Migāra’s mother, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to her, “So, Visākhā, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?” </p>
<p id="an3.70:1.5">“Today, sir, I’m observing the sabbath.” </p>
<p id="an3.70:2.1">“There are, Visākhā, these three sabbaths. What three? The sabbath of the cowherds, the sabbath of the Jains, and the sabbath of the noble ones. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an3.70:2.4">And what is the sabbath of the cowherds? It’s just like a cowherd who, in the late afternoon, takes the cows back to their owners. They reflect: ‘Today the cows grazed in this place and that, and they drank in this place and that. Tomorrow the cows will graze in this place and that, and drink in this place and that.’ In the same way, someone keeping the sabbath reflects: ‘Today I ate this and that, and had a meal of this and that. Tomorrow I’ll eat this and that, and have a meal of this and that.’ And so they spend their day with a mind full of covetousness. That’s the sabbath of the cowherds. When the cowherd’s sabbath is observed like this it’s not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or bountiful. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an3.70:3.1">And what is the sabbath of the Jains? There’s a kind of ascetic belonging to a group called the Jains. They encourage their disciples: ‘Please, good people, don’t hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the east. Don’t hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the west. Don’t hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the north. Don’t hurt any living creatures more than a hundred leagues away to the south.’ So they encourage kindness and compassion for some creatures and not others. On the sabbath, they encourage their disciples: ‘Please, good people, take off all your clothes and say: “I don’t belong to anyone anywhere! And nothing belongs to me anywhere!”’ But their mother and father still know, ‘This is our child.’ And they know, ‘This is my mother and father.’ Partner and child still know, ‘This is our supporter.’ And they know, ‘This is my partner and child.’ Bondservants, workers, and staff still know: ‘This is our master.’ And they know, ‘These are my bondservants, workers, and staff.’ So, at a time when they should be encouraged to speak the truth, the Jains encourage them to lie. This, I say, is lying. When the night has passed they use their possessions once more, though they’ve not been given back to them. This, I say, is stealing. That’s the sabbath of the Jains. When the Jain’s sabbath is observed like this it’s not very fruitful or beneficial or splendid or bountiful. </p>
<p id="an3.70:4.1">And what is the sabbath of the noble ones? A corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? It’s when a noble disciple recollects the Realized One: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ As they recollect the Realized One, their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up. It’s just like cleaning a dirty head by applying effort. </p>
<p id="an3.70:5.1">And how is a dirty head cleaned by applying effort? With cleansing paste, clay, and water, and by applying the appropriate effort. In the same way, a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an3.70:6.1">And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? It’s when a noble disciple recollects the Realized One: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ As they recollect the Realized One, their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up. This is called: ‘A noble disciple who observes the sabbath of Brahmā, living together with Brahmā. And because they think of Brahmā their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up.’ That’s how a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. </p>
<p id="an3.70:7.1">A corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? It’s when a noble disciple recollects the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ As they recollect the teaching, their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up. It’s just like cleaning a dirty body by applying effort. </p>
<p id="an3.70:8.1">And how is a dirty body cleaned by applying effort? With pastes of powdered shells and herbs, water, and by applying the appropriate effort. That’s how a dirty body is cleaned by applying effort. In the same way, a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. </p>

This is called: ‘A noble disciple who observes the sabbath of Dhamma, living together with Dhamma. And because they think of the Dhamma their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up.’ That’s how a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. </p>
<p id="an3.70:10.1">A corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? It’s when a noble disciple recollects the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ As they recollect the Saṅgha, their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up. It’s just like cleaning a dirty cloth by applying effort. </p>
<p id="an3.70:11.1">And how is a dirty cloth cleaned by applying effort? With salt, lye, cow dung, and water, and by applying the appropriate effort. That’s how a dirty cloth is cleaned by applying effort. In the same way, a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an3.70:12.1">And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort?

And because they think of the Saṅgha their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up.’ That’s how a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. </p>
<p id="an3.70:13.1">A corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort? It’s when a noble disciple recollects their own ethical conduct, which is unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. As they recollect their ethical conduct, their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up. It’s just like cleaning a dirty mirror by applying effort. </p>
<p id="an3.70:14.1">And how is a dirty mirror cleaned by applying effort? With oil, ash, a rolled-up cloth, and by applying the appropriate effort. That’s how a dirty mirror is cleaned by applying effort. In the same way, a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. </p>

And because they think of their ethical conduct their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up.’ That’s how a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. </p>
<p id="an3.70:16.1">A corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. And how is a corrupt mind cleaned by applying effort?

When those deities passed away from here, they were reborn there because of their faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. I, too, have the same kind of faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.’ As they recollect the faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom of both themselves and those deities, their mind becomes clear, joy arises, and mental corruptions are given up. It’s just like cleaning dirty gold by applying effort. </p>
<p id="an3.70:17.1">And how is dirty gold cleaned by applying effort? With a furnace, flux, a blowpipe, and tongs, and by applying the appropriate effort. That’s how dirty gold is cleaned by applying effort. In the same way, a corrupt mind is cleaned by applying effort. </p>

<p id="an3.70:19.1">Then that noble disciple reflects: ‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They are scrupulous and kind, and live full of compassion for all living beings. I, too, for this day and night will give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. I’ll be scrupulous and kind, and live full of compassion for all living beings. I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect. </p>
<p id="an3.70:20.1">As long as they live, the perfected ones give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving. I, too, for this day and night will give up stealing. I’ll take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. I’ll keep myself clean by not thieving. I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect. </p>
<p id="an3.70:21.1">As long as they live, the perfected ones give up unchastity. They are celibate, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex. I, too, for this day and night will give up unchastity.

<p id="an3.70:22.1">As long as they live, the perfected ones give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and trustworthy, and don’t trick the world with their words. I, too, for this day and night will give up lying. I’ll speak the truth and stick to the truth. I’ll be honest and trustworthy, and won’t trick the world with my words.

<p id="an3.70:24.1">As long as they live, the perfected ones eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and from food at the wrong time. I, too, for this day and night will eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time. I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect. </p>
<p id="an3.70:25.1">As long as they live, the perfected ones avoid seeing shows of dancing, singing, and music ; and beautifying and adorning themselves with garlands, fragrance, and makeup. I, too, for this day and night will avoid seeing shows of dancing, singing, and music ; and beautifying and adorning myself with garlands, fragrance, and makeup. I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect. </p>

I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’ </p>
<p id="an3.70:27.1">That’s the sabbath of the noble ones. When the sabbath of the noble ones is observed like this it’s very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful. </p>
<p id="an3.70:28.1">How much so? Suppose you were to rule as sovereign lord over these sixteen great countries—Aṅga, Magadha, Kāsi, Kosala, Vajji, Malla, Cetī, Vaccha, Kuru, Pañcāla, Maccha, Sūrasena, Assaka, Avanti, Gandhāra, and Kamboja—full of the seven treasures. This wouldn’t be worth a sixteenth part of the sabbath with its eight factors. Why is that? Because human kingship is a poor thing compared to the happiness of the gods. </p>
<p id="an3.70:29.1">Fifty years in the human realm is one day and night for the gods of the Four Great Kings. Thirty such days make up a month. Twelve such months make up a year.

<p id="an3.71:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then the wanderer Channa went up to Venerable Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to Ānanda: </p>
<p id="an3.71:1.4">“Reverend Ānanda, do you advocate giving up greed, hate, and delusion?” </p>
<p id="an3.71:1.5">“We do, reverend.” </p>
<p id="an3.71:2.1">“But what drawbacks have you seen, Reverend Ānanda, that you advocate giving up greed, hate, and delusion?” </p>
<p id="an3.71:3.1">“A greedy person, overcome by greed, intends to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. They experience mental pain and sadness. When greed has been given up, they don’t intend to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. They don’t experience mental pain and sadness. A greedy person does bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When greed has been given up, they don’t do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. A greedy person doesn’t truly understand what’s for their own good, the good of another, or the good of both. When greed has been given up, they truly understand what’s for their own good, the good of another, or the good of both. Greed is a destroyer of sight, vision, and knowledge. It blocks wisdom, it’s on the side of anguish, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment. </p>
<p id="an3.71:4.1">A hateful person, overcome by hate, intends to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. … </p>
<p id="an3.71:4.2">A deluded person, overcome by delusion, intends to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. They experience mental pain and sadness. When delusion has been given up, they don’t intend to hurt themselves, hurt others, and hurt both. They don’t experience mental pain and sadness. A deluded person does bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When delusion has been given up, they don’t do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. A deluded person doesn’t truly understand what’s for their own good, the good of another, or the good of both. When delusion has been given up, they truly understand what’s for their own good, the good of another, or the good of both. Delusion is a destroyer of sight, vision, and knowledge; it blocks wisdom, it’s on the side of anguish, and it doesn’t lead to extinguishment. </p>
<p id="an3.71:4.9">This is the drawback we’ve seen in greed, hate, and delusion, and this is why we advocate giving them up.” </p>
<p id="an3.71:5.1">“But, reverend, is there a path and a practice for giving up that greed, hate, and delusion?” </p>
<p id="an3.71:5.2">“There is, reverend, a path and a practice for giving up that greed, hate, and delusion.” </p>
<p id="an3.71:5.3">“Well, what is it?” </p>
<p id="an3.71:5.4">“It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. This is the path, this is the practice for giving up that greed, hate, and delusion.” </p>
<p id="an3.71:5.7">“This is a fine path, a fine practice, for giving up that greed, hate, and delusion. Just this much is enough to be diligent.” </p>

<p id="an3.72:1.1">At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery. Then a householder who was a disciple of the Ājīvaka ascetics went up to Venerable Ānanda, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to Ānanda: </p>
<p id="an3.72:2.1">“Honorable Ānanda, whose teaching is well explained? Who in the world is practicing well? Who in the world has done well?” </p>
<p id="an3.72:2.4">“Well then, householder, I’ll ask you about this in return, and you can answer as you like. What do you think, householder? Is the teaching of those who teach for giving up greed, hate, and delusion well explained or not? Or how do you see this?” </p>
<p id="an3.72:2.8">“The teaching of those who teach for giving up greed, hate, and delusion is well explained. That’s how I see it.” </p>
<p id="an3.72:3.1">“What do you think, householder? Are those who practice for giving up greed, hate, and delusion practicing well or not? Or how do you see this?” </p>
<p id="an3.72:3.4">“Those who practice for giving up greed, hate, and delusion are practicing well. That’s how I see it.” </p>
<p id="an3.72:4.1">“What do you think, householder? Have those who’ve given up greed, hate, and delusion—so they’re cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future—done well in the world, or not? Or how do you see this?” </p>
<p id="an3.72:4.4">“Those who’ve given up greed, hate, and delusion have done well in the world. That’s how I see it.” </p>
<p id="an3.72:5.1">“So, householder, you’ve declared: ‘The teaching of those who teach for giving up greed, hate, and delusion is well explained.’ And you’ve declared: ‘Those who practice for giving up greed, hate, and delusion are practicing well.’ And you’ve declared: ‘Those who’ve given up greed, hate, and delusion have done well in the world.’” </p>
<p id="an3.72:6.1">“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! There’s no acclaiming your own teaching or disrespecting someone else’s, just teaching what’s relevant in that context. The goal is spoken of, but the self is not involved. You, sir, teach Dhamma for giving up greed, hate, and delusion. Your teaching is well explained. You, sir, practice for giving up greed, hate, and delusion. You in the world are practicing well. You’ve given up greed, hate, and delusion. You in the world have done well. </p>
<p id="an3.72:7.1">Excellent, sir! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, Venerable Ānanda has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Venerable Ānanda remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<h4 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">AN 3.73</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">With Mahānāma the Sakyan </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Mahānāmasakkasutta</span></h4>
<p id="an3.73:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Now at that time the Buddha had recently recovered from an illness. Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an3.73:1.5">“For a long time, sir, I have understood your teaching like this: ‘Knowledge is for those with immersion, not those without immersion.’ But, sir, does immersion come first, then knowledge? Or does knowledge come first, then immersion?” </p>
<p id="an3.73:1.9">Then Venerable Ānanda thought, “The Buddha has recently recovered from an illness, and this Mahānāma asks him a question that’s too deep. Why don’t I take him off to one side and teach him the Dhamma?” </p>
<p id="an3.73:2.1">Then Ānanda took Mahānāma by the arm, led him off to one side, and said to him, “Mahānāma, the Buddha has spoken of the ethics, immersion, and wisdom of a trainee; and the ethics, immersion, and wisdom of an adept. What is the ethics of a trainee? It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. This is called the ethics of a trainee. </p>
<p id="an3.73:3.1">And what is the immersion of a trainee? It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. This is called the immersion of a trainee. </p>

<p id="an3.74:1.1">At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then the Licchavis Abhaya and Paṇḍitakumāra went up to Venerable Ānanda, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an3.74:1.3">“Sir, the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus: ‘Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.’ He advocates the elimination of past deeds by fervent mortification, and breaking the bridge by not doing any new deeds. So with the ending of karma, suffering ends; with the ending of suffering, feeling ends; and with the ending of feeling, all suffering will have been worn away. This is how to go beyond suffering by means of this purification by wearing away in this very life. What, sir, does the Buddha say about this?” </p>
<p id="an3.74:2.1">“Abhaya, these three kinds of purification by wearing away have been rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment. What three? </p>
<p id="an3.74:2.3">It’s when, Abhaya, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. They don’t perform any new deeds, and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by little. This wearing away is apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves. </p>
<p id="an3.74:3.1">Then a mendicant accomplished in ethics, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. They don’t perform any new deeds, and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by little. This wearing away is apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves. </p>
<p id="an3.74:4.1">Then a mendicant accomplished in immersion realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. They don’t perform any new deeds, and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by little. This wearing away is apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves. </p>
<p id="an3.74:4.4">These are the three kinds of purification by wearing away that have been rightly explained by the Buddha … in order to realize extinguishment.” </p>
<p id="an3.74:5.1">When he said this, Paṇḍitakumāra said to Abhaya, “Dear Abhaya, is there anything in what Ānanda has said so well that you would disagree with?” </p>
<p id="an3.74:5.3">“How could I not agree with what was said so well by Ānanda? If anyone didn’t agree with him, their head would explode!” </p>

This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ </p>
<p id="an3.75:3.1">There might be change in the four primary elements—earth, water, air, and fire—but a noble disciple with experiential confidence in the Buddha would never change. In this context, ‘change’ means that such a noble disciple will be reborn in hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm: this is quite impossible. </p>

However, Ānanda will be extinguished in the present life.” </p>

<p id="an3.91:1.1">At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. He arrived at a town of the Kosalans named Paṅkadhā, and stayed there. </p>
<p id="an3.91:1.3">Now, at that time a monk called Kassapagotta was resident at Paṅkadhā. There the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about the training rules. Kassapagotta became quite impatient and bitter, thinking, “This ascetic is much too strict.” </p>
<p id="an3.91:1.7">When the Buddha had stayed in Paṅkadhā as long as he pleased, he set out for Rājagaha. Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Rājagaha, and stayed there. </p>
<p id="an3.91:2.1">Soon after the Buddha left, Kassapagotta became quite remorseful and regretful, thinking, “It’s my loss, my misfortune, that when the Buddha was talking about the training rules I became quite impatient and bitter, thinking he was much too strict. Why don’t I go to the Buddha and confess my mistake to him?” </p>
<p id="an3.91:2.6">Then Kassapagotta set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Rājagaha. Eventually he came to Rājagaha and the Vulture’s Peak. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, saying: </p>
<p id="an3.91:3.1">“I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to become impatient and bitter when the Buddha was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants with a Dhamma talk about the training rules, and to think, ‘This ascetic is much too strict.’ Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.” </p>
<p id="an3.91:4.1">“Indeed, Kassapa, you made a mistake. But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it. For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future. </p>
<p id="an3.91:5.1">Kassapa, take the case of a senior mendicant who doesn’t want to train and doesn’t praise taking up the training. They don’t encourage other mendicants who don’t want to train to take up the training. And they don’t truthfully and correctly praise at the right time those mendicants who do want to train. I don’t praise that kind of senior mendicant. Why is that? Because, hearing that I praised that mendicant, other mendicants might want to keep company with them. Then they might follow their example, which would be for their lasting harm and suffering. That’s why I don’t praise that kind of senior mendicant. </p>

When the time is right, they swiftly irrigate or drain the field. These are the three urgent duties of a farmer. That farmer has no special power or ability to say: ‘Let the crops germinate today! Let them flower tomorrow! Let them ripen the day after!’ But there comes a time when that farmer’s crops germinate, flower, and ripen as the seasons change. </p>
<p id="an3.92:2.1">In the same way, a mendicant has three urgent duties. What three? Undertaking the training in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom. These are the three urgent duties of a mendicant. That mendicant has no special power or ability to say: ‘Let my mind be freed from defilements by not grasping today! Or tomorrow! Or the day after!’ But there comes a time—as that mendicant trains in the higher ethics, the higher mind, and the higher wisdom—that their mind is freed from defilements by not grasping. </p>

<p id="an3.93:1.1">“Mendicants, wanderers of other religions advocate three kinds of seclusion. What three? Seclusion in robes, almsfood, and lodgings. </p>
<p id="an3.93:2.1">Wanderers of other religions advocate this kind of seclusion in robes. They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings. This is what wanderers of other religions advocate for seclusion in robes. </p>
<p id="an3.93:3.1">Wanderers of other religions advocate this kind of seclusion in almsfood. They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit. This is what the wanderers of other religions advocate for seclusion in almsfood. </p>
<p id="an3.93:4.1">Wanderers of other religions advocate this kind of seclusion in lodgings. They stay in a wilderness, at the root of a tree, in a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw, or a threshing-hut. This is what wanderers of other religions advocate for seclusion in lodgings. These are the three kinds of seclusion that wanderers of other religions advocate. </p>
<p id="an3.93:5.1">In this teaching and training, there are three kinds of seclusion for a mendicant. What three? Firstly, a mendicant is ethical, giving up unethical conduct, being secluded from it. They have right view, giving up wrong view, being secluded from it. They’ve ended defilements, giving up defilements, being secluded from them. When a mendicant has these three kinds of seclusion, they’re called a mendicant who has reached the peak and the pith, being pure and grounded in the essential. </p>
<p id="an3.93:6.1">When a farmer’s rice field is ripe, they’d have the rice cut swiftly, gathered swiftly, transported swiftly, made into heaps swiftly, threshed swiftly, the straw and chaff removed swiftly, winnowed swiftly, brought over swiftly, pounded swiftly, and have the husks removed swiftly. In this way that farmer’s crop would reach the peak and the pith, being pure and established in the pith. </p>
<p id="an3.93:7.1">In the same way, when a mendicant is ethical, giving up unethical conduct, being secluded from it; when they have right view, giving up wrong view, being secluded from it; when they’ve ended defilements, giving up defilements, being secluded from them: they’re called a mendicant who has reached the peak and the pith, being pure and grounded in the essential.” </p>

<p id="an3.94:3.1">Afterwards they get rid of two things: covetousness and ill will. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.

<p id="an3.95:2.1">And what is an assembly of the best? An assembly where the senior mendicants are not indulgent or slack, nor are they backsliders. Instead, they take the lead in seclusion, rousing energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized. And those who come afterwards follow their example. They too are not indulgent or slack, nor are they backsliders. Instead, they take the lead in seclusion, rousing energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized. This is called an assembly of the best. </p>
<p id="an3.95:3.1">And what is a divided assembly? An assembly where the mendicants argue, quarrel, and dispute, continually wounding each other with barbed words. This is called a divided assembly. </p>
<p id="an3.95:4.1">And what is a harmonious assembly? An assembly where the mendicants live in harmony, appreciating each other, without quarreling, blending like milk and water, and regarding each other with kindly eyes. This is called a harmonious assembly. </p>
<p id="an3.95:5.1">When the mendicants live in harmony like this, they make much merit. At that time the mendicants live in a holy dwelling, that is, the heart’s release by rejoicing. When they’re joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when they’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. </p>
<p id="an3.95:6.1">It’s like when it rains heavily on a mountain top, and the water flows downhill to fill the hollows, crevices, and creeks. As they become full, they fill up the pools. The pools fill up the lakes, the lakes fill up the streams, and the streams fill up the rivers. And as the rivers become full, they fill up the ocean. </p>

If you associate with, accompany, and attend to such a person, following their example, it will be for your lasting welfare and happiness. This is how they’re pleasant to touch, I say. That person is just as pleasant to touch as cloth from Kāsi. Any robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick that they receive are very fruitful and beneficial for the donor. This is how they’re valuable, I say. That person is just as valuable as cloth from Kāsi. </p>

<p id="an3.99:6.4">So you should train like this: ‘We will be like cloth from Kāsi, not like jute canvas.’ That’s how you should train.” </p>

This lust in the heart is what I call a fetter. That’s how desire comes up for things that stimulate desire and greed in the past, future, or present. </p>

<p id="an3.126:5.1">Then, when the night had passed, Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: </p>
<p id="an3.126:5.2">“Mahānāma, there are these three teachers found in the world. What three? One teacher advocates the complete understanding of sensual pleasures, but not of forms or feelings. One teacher advocates the complete understanding of sensual pleasures and forms, but not of feelings. One teacher advocates the complete understanding of sensual pleasures, forms, and feelings. These are the three teachers found in the world. Do these three teachers have the same goal or different goals?” </p>

<p id="an3.127:1.2">Then, late at night, the glorious god Hatthaka, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha. Thinking, “I will stand before the Buddha,” he sank and melted down, and wasn’t able to stay still. It’s like when ghee or oil is poured on sand, it sinks and melts down, and can’t remain stable. </p>
<p id="an3.127:2.1">Then the Buddha said to Hatthaka, “Hatthaka, manifest in a solid life-form.” </p>

<p id="an3.128:1.2">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Varanasi for alms. While the Buddha was walking for alms near the cow-hitching place at the wavy leaf fig, he saw a disgruntled monk who was looking for pleasure in external things, unmindful, without situational awareness or immersion, with straying mind and undisciplined faculties. </p>
<p id="an3.128:1.4">The Buddha said to him, “Monk, don’t be bitter. If you’re bitter, corrupted by putrefaction, flies will, without a doubt, plague and infest you.” </p>

<p id="an3.128:5.1">“Desire is bitterness; ill will is the putrefaction; and bad, unskillful thoughts are the flies. If you’re bitter, corrupted by putrefaction, flies will, without a doubt, plague and infest you. </p>

<p id="an3.130:2.1">“Well, Reverend Anuruddha, when you say: ‘With clairvoyance that is purified and surpasses the human, I survey the entire galaxy,’ that’s your conceit. And when you say: ‘My energy is roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness is established and lucid, my body is tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind is immersed in samādhi,’ that’s your restlessness. And when you say: ‘But my mind is not freed from the defilements by not grasping,’ that’s your remorse. It would be good to give up these three things. Ignore them and apply your mind to the deathless.” </p>
<p id="an3.130:3.1">After some time Anuruddha gave up these three things. Ignoring them, he applied his mind to the deathless. Then Anuruddha, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="an3.130:3.3">He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable Anuruddha became one of the perfected. </p>

<p id="an3.142:2.4">These are the three fine thoroughbred horses. </p>

<p id="an3.142:4.1">And how is a fine thoroughbred person … fast, beautiful, and well proportioned? It’s when a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. This is how they’re fast, I say. When asked a question about the teaching or training, they answer without faltering. This is how they’re beautiful, I say. They receive robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. This is how they’re well proportioned, I say. This is how a fine thoroughbred person is fast, beautiful, and well proportioned. </p>

<article id="an3.156">
<p id="an3.156:1.1">“Mendicants, there are three practices. What three? The addicted practice, the scorching practice, and the middle practice. </p>
<p id="an3.156:1.4">And what’s the addicted practice? It’s when someone has this doctrine and view: ‘There’s nothing wrong with sensual pleasures’; so they throw themselves into sensual pleasures. This is called the addicted practice. </p>
<p id="an3.156:2.1">And what’s the scorching practice? It’s when someone goes naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on purpose for them, or an invitation for a meal. They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who has a man in her home; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or liquor or wine, and drink no beer. They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls. They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day. They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live pursuing the practice of eating food at set intervals. </p>
<p id="an3.156:3.1">They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit. </p>
<p id="an3.156:4.1">They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings. They tear out their hair and beard, committed to this practice. They constantly stand, refusing seats. They squat, committed to persisting in the squatting position. They lie on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns their bed. They pursue the practice of immersion in water three times a day, including the evening. And so they live pursuing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body. This is called the scorching practice. </p>
<p id="an3.156:5.1">And what’s the middle practice? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings … They meditate observing an aspect of the mind … They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of covetousness and displeasure for the world. This is called the middle practice. </p>

<p data-counter="2" id="an3.157:3.1">And what’s the middle practice? It’s when a mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are completed by development. … </p>

<p id="an4.1:2.1">“Mendicants, due to not understanding and not penetrating four things, both you and I have wandered and transmigrated for such a very long time. What four? Noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom. These noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom have been understood and comprehended. Craving for continued existence has been cut off; the conduit to rebirth is ended; now there’ll be no more future lives.” </p>

<p id="an4.21:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>
<p id="an4.21:1.5">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="an4.21:2.1">“Mendicants, this one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying in Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. As I was in private retreat this thought came to mind: ‘One without respect and reverence lives in suffering. What ascetic or brahmin should I honor and respect and rely on?’ </p>
<p id="an4.21:3.1">Then it occurred to me: ‘I would honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of ethics, if it were incomplete. But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who is more accomplished than myself in ethics, who I should honor and respect and rely on. </p>
<p id="an4.21:4.1">I would honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of immersion, if it were incomplete. But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in immersion … </p>
<p id="an4.21:5.1">I would honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entrie spectrum of wisdom, if it were incomplete. But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world … who is more accomplished than myself in wisdom … </p>
<p id="an4.21:6.1">I would honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of freedom, if it were incomplete. But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world … who is more accomplished than myself in freedom …’ </p>
<p id="an4.21:7.1">Then it occurred to me: ‘Why don’t I honor and respect and rely on the same teaching to which I was awakened?’ </p>
<p id="an4.21:8.1">And then Brahmā Sahampati, knowing what I was thinking, vanished from the Brahmā realm and appeared in front of me, as easily as a strong man would extend or contract his arm. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward me, and said: ‘That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past honored and respected and relied on this same teaching. All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future will honor and respect and rely on this same teaching. May the Blessed One, who is the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present, also honor and respect and rely on this same teaching.’ </p>
<p id="an4.21:8.7">That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he went on to say: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an4.21:9.1">‘All Buddhas, whether in the past, <br/>the Buddhas of the future, <br/>and the Buddha at present—<br/>destroyer of the sorrows of many—</p>
<p id="an4.21:10.1">respecting the true teaching <br/>they did live, they do live, <br/>and they also will live. <br/>This is the nature of the Buddhas. </p>
<p id="an4.21:11.1">Therefore someone who cares for their own welfare, <br/>and wants to become the very best they can be, <br/>should respect the true teaching, <br/>remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.’ </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="an4.21:12.1">That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he bowed and respectfully circled me, keeping me on his right side, before vanishing right there. Then, knowing the request of Brahmā and what was suitable for myself, I honored and respected and relied on the same teaching to which I was awakened. And since the Saṅgha has also achieved greatness, I also respect the Saṅgha.” </p>

<p id="an4.22:1.1">“Mendicants, this one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying in Uruvelā at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the Nerañjarā River. Then several old brahmins—elderly and senior, who were advanced in years and had reached the final stage of life—came up to me, and exchanged greetings with me. </p>
<p id="an4.22:1.3">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side, and said to me: ‘Master Gotama, we have heard this: </p>
<p id="an4.22:1.5">“The ascetic Gotama does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat.” And this is indeed the case, for Master Gotama does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat. This is not appropriate, Master Gotama.’ </p>
<p id="an4.22:2.1">Then it occurred to me, ‘These venerables don’t know what a senior is, or what qualities make you a senior.’ </p>
<p id="an4.22:2.3">Mendicants, suppose you’re eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old. But your speech is untimely, false, meaningless, and against the teaching or training. You say things at the wrong time which are worthless, unreasonable, rambling, and unbeneficial. Then you’ll be considered a ‘childish senior’. </p>
<p id="an4.22:3.1">Now suppose you’re a youth, young, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life. But your speech is timely, true, meaningful, and in line with the teaching and training. You say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial. Then you’ll be considered an ‘astute senior’. </p>
<p id="an4.22:4.1">There are these four qualities that make a senior. What four? A mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. </p>
<p id="an4.22:4.4">They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically. </p>
<p id="an4.22:4.5">They get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty. </p>
<p id="an4.22:4.6">They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. </p>
<p id="an4.22:4.7">These are the four qualities that make a senior. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an4.22:5.1">The creature with a restless mind <br/>speaks a lot of nonsense. <br/>Their thoughts are unsettled, <br/>and they don’t like the true teaching. <br/>They’re far from seniority, with their bad views <br/>and their lack of regard for others. </p>
<p id="an4.22:6.1">But one accomplished in ethics, <br/>learned and eloquent, that wise one <br/>is restrained when experiencing phenomena, <br/>discerning the meaning with wisdom. </p>
<p id="an4.22:7.1">Gone beyond all things, <br/>kind, eloquent, <br/>they’ve given up birth and death, <br/>and have completed the spiritual journey. </p>

They included Annabhāra, Varadhara, Sakuludāyī, and other very well-known wanderers. Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the wanderer’s monastery on the banks of the Sappinī river, He sat down on the seat spread out, and said to the wanderers: </p>

Then he sets out on the hunt. And the animals who hear the roar of the lion, king of beasts, are typically filled with fear, awe, and terror. They return to their lairs, be they in a hole, the water, or a wood; and the birds take to the air. Even the royal elephants, bound with strong harnesses in the villages, towns, and capital cities, break apart their bonds, and urinate and defecate in terror as they flee here and there.

It turns out that we’re impermanent, not lasting, transient, and included within identity.’ </p>

<p id="an4.37:3.1">And how does a mendicant guard the sense doors? When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving restraint over it. Hearing a sound with their ears … Smelling an odor with their nose … Tasting a flavor with their tongue … Feeling a touch with their body … Knowing a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving restraint over it. That’s how a mendicant guards the sense doors. </p>
<p id="an4.37:4.1">And how does a mendicant eat in moderation? It’s when a mendicant reflects rationally on the food that they eat: ‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’ That’s how a mendicant eats in moderation. </p>
<p id="an4.37:5.1">And how is a mendicant dedicated to wakefulness? It’s when a mendicant practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying their mind from obstacles. In the evening, they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation. In the middle of the night, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. In the last part of the night, they get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying their mind from obstacles. This is how a mendicant is dedicated to wakefulness. A mendicant who has these four qualities can’t decline, and has drawn near to extinguishment. </p>

<p id="an4.41:1.1">“Mendicants, there are these four ways of developing immersion further. What four? There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to blissful meditation in the present life. There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to gaining knowledge and vision. There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to mindfulness and awareness. There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to the ending of defilements. </p>
<p id="an4.41:2.1">And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to blissful meditation in the present life? It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to blissful meditation in the present life. </p>
<p id="an4.41:3.1">And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to gaining knowledge and vision? It’s when a mendicant focuses on the perception of light, concentrating on the perception of day: as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance. This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to gaining knowledge and vision. </p>
<p id="an4.41:4.1">And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to mindfulness and awareness? It’s when a mendicant knows feelings as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. They know perceptions as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. They know thoughts as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to mindfulness and awareness. </p>
<p id="an4.41:5.1">And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to the ending of defilements? It’s when a mendicant meditates observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates. ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling. Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is the ending of perception.

He makes his mother and father happy … He makes his children, partners, bondservants, workers, and staff happy … He makes his friends and colleagues happy … This is his first expenditure in an appropriate sphere on a deserved and fitting cause. </p>
<p id="an4.61:14.1">Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he defends himself against threats from such things as fire, flood, rulers, bandits, or unloved heirs. He keeps himself safe. This is his second expenditure in an appropriate sphere on a deserved and fitting cause. </p>
<p id="an4.61:15.1">Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he makes five spirit-offerings: to relatives, guests, ancestors, king, and deities. This is his third expenditure in an appropriate sphere on a deserved and fitting cause. </p>
<p id="an4.61:16.1">Furthermore, with his legitimate wealth he establishes an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins—those who avoid intoxication and negligence, are settled in patience and gentleness, and who tame, calm, and extinguish themselves—that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven. This is his fourth expenditure in an appropriate sphere on a deserved and fitting cause. </p>

They’re healthy, so the various unpleasant feelings—stemming from disorders of bile, phlegm, wind, or their conjunction; or caused by change in weather, by not taking care of yourself, by overexertion, or as the result of past deeds—usually don’t come up. They get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty.

<p id="an4.111:4.6">“It’s true, Kesi, it’s not appropriate for a Realized One to kill living creatures. But when a person in training doesn’t follow any of these forms of training, the Realized One doesn’t think they’re worth advising or instructing, and neither do their sensible spiritual companions. For it is killing in the training of the Noble One when the Realized One doesn’t think they’re worth advising or instructing, and neither do their sensible spiritual companions.” </p>
<p id="an4.111:5.1">“Well, they’re definitely dead when the Realized One doesn’t think they’re worth advising or instructing, and neither do their sensible spiritual companions. Excellent, sir! … From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>

I can both enjoy my wealth and make merit. Why don’t I resign the training and return to a lesser life, so I can enjoy my wealth and make merit?’ They resign the training and return to a lesser life.

<p id="an4.123:1.1">“Mendicants, these four people are found in the world. What four? </p>
<p id="an4.123:1.3">Firstly, a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying. If they abide in that, are committed to it, and meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they’re reborn in the company of the gods of Brahmā’s Host. The lifespan of the gods of Brahma’s Host is one eon. An ordinary person stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent, then they go to hell or the animal realm or the ghost realm. But a disciple of the Buddha stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent, then they’re extinguished in that very life. This is the difference between a learned noble disciple and an unlearned ordinary person, that is, when there is a place of rebirth. </p>
<p id="an4.123:2.1">As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying. If they abide in that, are committed to it, and meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they’re reborn in the company of the gods of streaming radiance. The lifespan of the gods of streaming radiance is two eons. An ordinary person stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent, then they go to hell or the animal realm or the ghost realm. But a disciple of the Buddha stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent, then they’re extinguished in that very life. This is the difference between a learned noble disciple and an unlearned ordinary person, that is, when there is a place of rebirth. </p>
<p id="an4.123:3.1">Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying. If they abide in that, are committed to it, and meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they’re reborn in the company of the gods replete with glory. The lifespan of the gods replete with glory is four eons. An ordinary person stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent, then they go to hell or the animal realm or the ghost realm. But a disciple of the Buddha stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent, then they’re extinguished in that very life. This is the difference between a learned noble disciple and an unlearned ordinary person, that is, when there is a place of rebirth. </p>
<p id="an4.123:4.1">Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.

<p id="an4.159:4.1">“Sister, this body is produced by food. Relying on food, you should give up food. This body is produced by craving. Relying on craving, you should give up craving. This body is produced by conceit. Relying on conceit, you should give up conceit. This body is produced by sex. The Buddha spoke of breaking off everything to do with sex. </p>
<p id="an4.159:5.1">‘This body is produced by food. Relying on food, you should give up food.’ This is what I said, but why did I say it? Take a mendicant who reflects rationally on the food that they eat: ‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’ After some time, relying on food, they give up food. That’s why I said what I said. </p>
<p id="an4.159:6.1">‘This body is produced by craving. Relying on craving, you should give up craving.’ This is what I said, but why did I say it? Take a mendicant who hears this: ‘They say that the mendicant named so-and-so has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ They think: ‘Oh, when will I too realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. …’ After some time, relying on craving, they give up craving. That's why I said what I said. </p>
<p id="an4.159:7.1">‘This body is produced by conceit. Relying on conceit, you should give up conceit.’ This is what I said, but why did I say it?

And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ They think: ‘Well, that venerable can realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. … Why can’t I?’ After some time, relying on conceit, they give up conceit.

<p id="an4.159:8.1">‘This body is produced by sex. The Buddha spoke of breaking off everything to do with sex.’” </p>
<p id="an4.159:9.1">Then that nun rose from her cot, placed her robe over one shoulder, bowed with her head at Ānanda’s feet, and said, “I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to act in that way. Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I can restrain myself in future.” </p>
<p id="an4.159:9.4">“Indeed, sister, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to act in that way.

<p id="an4.165:1.1">“Mendicants, there are four ways of practice. What four? Impatient practice, patient practice, taming practice, and calming practice. </p>
<p id="an4.165:2.1">And what’s the impatient practice? It’s when a mendicant cannot endure cold, heat, hunger, and thirst. They cannot endure the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. They cannot endure rude and unwelcome criticism. And they cannot put up with physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening. This is called the impatient practice. </p>
<p id="an4.165:3.1">And what’s the patient practice? It’s when a mendicant endures cold, heat, hunger, and thirst. They endure the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. They endure rude and unwelcome criticism. And they put up with physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening. This is called the patient practice. </p>
<p id="an4.165:4.1">And what’s the taming practice? When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. … When they hear a sound with their ears … When they smell an odor with their nose … When they taste a flavor with their tongue … When they feel a touch with their body … When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving restraint over it. This is called the taming practice. </p>
<p id="an4.165:5.1">And what’s the calming practice? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought. They don’t tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, calm them, eliminate them, and obliterate them. This is called the calming practice. </p>

<p id="an4.171:1.1">“Mendicants, as long as there’s a body, the intention that gives rise to bodily action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself. As long as there’s a voice, the intention that gives rise to verbal action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself. As long as there’s a mind, the intention that gives rise to mental action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself. But these only apply when conditioned by ignorance. </p>
<p id="an4.171:2.1">By oneself one makes the choice that gives rise to bodily, verbal, and mental action, conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself. Or else others make the choice … One consciously makes the choice … Or else one unconsciously makes the choice … </p>

<p id="an4.171:7.2">“Sir, this is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement. Take the case of the reincarnation where one’s own intention is effective, not that of others. Those sentient beings pass away from that realm due to their own intention. Take the case of the reincarnation where the intention of others is effective, not one’s own. Those sentient beings pass away from that realm due to the intention of others. Take the case of the reincarnation where both one’s own and others’ intentions are effective. Those sentient beings pass away from that realm due to both their own and others’ intentions. But sir, in the case of the reincarnation where neither one’s own nor others’ intentions are effective, what kind of gods does this refer to?” </p>

They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying. If they abide in that, are committed to it, and meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they’re reborn in the company of the gods of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. When they pass away from there, they’re a returner, who comes back to this state of existence. </p>

<p id="an4.187:1.2">Then Vassakāra the brahmin, a chief minister of Magadha, went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="an4.187:2.1">“Master Gotama, could an untrue person know of an untrue person: ‘This fellow is an untrue person’?” </p>
<p id="an4.187:2.3">“That’s impossible, brahmin, it can’t happen.” </p>
<p id="an4.187:2.5">“Could an untrue person know of a true person: ‘This fellow is a true person’?” </p>
<p id="an4.187:2.7">“That too is impossible, it can’t happen.” </p>
<p id="an4.187:2.9">“Master Gotama, could a true person know of a true person: ‘This fellow is a true person’?” </p>
<p id="an4.187:2.11">“That, brahmin, is possible.” </p>
<p id="an4.187:2.13">“Could a true person know of an untrue person: ‘This fellow is an untrue person’?” </p>
<p id="an4.187:2.15">“That too is possible.” </p>
<p id="an4.187:3.1">“It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing, how well said this was by Master Gotama: ‘It’s impossible, it can’t happen, that an untrue person could know … But it is possible that a true person could know …’ </p>
<p id="an4.187:4.1">Once, members of the brahmin Todeyya’s assembly were going on complaining about others: ‘This King Eḷeyya is a fool to be so devoted to the ascetic Rāmaputta. He even shows him the utmost deference by bowing down to him, rising up for him, greeting him with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for him. And these king’s men are fools too—Yamaka, Moggalla, Ugga, Nāvindakī, Gandhabba, and Aggivessa—for they show the same kind of deference to Rāmaputta.’ Then the brahmin Todeyya reasoned with them like this: ‘What do the good sirs think? When it comes to the various duties and speeches, isn’t King Eḷeyya astute, even better than the experts?’ ‘That’s true, sir.’ </p>
<p id="an4.187:5.1">‘It’s because the ascetic Rāmaputta is even more astute and expert than King Eḷeyya that the king is so devoted to him. That’s why he even shows Rāmaputta the utmost deference by bowing down to him, rising up for him, greeting him with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for him. </p>
<p id="an4.187:6.1">‘What do the good sirs think? When it comes to the various duties and speeches, aren’t the king’s men—Yamaka, Moggalla, Ugga, Nāvindakī, Gandhabba, and Aggivessa—astute, even better than the experts?’ ‘That’s true, sir.’ </p>
<p id="an4.187:7.1">‘It’s because Rāmaputta is even more astute and expert than the king’s men that they have such devotion to him. … It’s because Rāmaputta is even more astute and expert than King Eḷeyya that the king is so devoted to him. That’s why he even shows Rāmaputta the utmost deference by bowing down to him, rising up for him, greeting him with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for him.’ </p>
<p id="an4.187:8.1">It’s incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing, how well said this was by Master Gotama: ‘It’s impossible, it can’t happen, that an untrue person could know … But it is possible that a true person could know … Well, now, Master Gotama, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.” </p>
<p id="an4.187:8.13">“Please, brahmin, go at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="an4.187:9.1">Then Vassakāra the brahmin, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got up from his seat and left. </p>

<p id="an4.188:1.1">Once the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. Then Upaka the son of Maṇḍikā went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an4.188:2.1">“Sir, this is my doctrine and view: ‘Whoever goes on complaining about others without giving any reasons is reprehensible and at fault.’” </p>
<p id="an4.188:2.4">“Upaka, if someone goes on complaining about others without giving a reason, they’re reprehensible and at fault. But that’s what you do, so you’re reprehensible and at fault!” </p>
<p id="an4.188:2.6">“Sir, like a fish caught in a big trap just as it rises, so the Buddha caught me in a big trap of words just as I rose up.” </p>
<p id="an4.188:3.1">“Upaka, I’ve declared: ‘This is unskillful.’ And there are limitless words, phrases, and teachings of the Realized One about that: ‘This is another way of saying that this is unskillful.’ I’ve declared: ‘The unskillful should be given up.’ And there are limitless words, phrases, and teachings of the Realized One about that: ‘This is another way of saying that the unskillful should be given up.’ </p>
<p id="an4.188:4.1">I’ve declared that: ‘This is skillful.’ And there are limitless words, phrases, and teachings of the Realized One about that: ‘This is another way of saying that this is skillful.’ I’ve declared: ‘The skillful should be developed.’ And there are limitless words, phrases, and teachings of the Realized One about that: ‘This is another way of saying that the skillful should be developed.’” </p>
<p id="an4.188:5.1">And then Upaka son of Maṇḍikā approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went up to King Ajātasattu of Magadha, son of the princess of Videha,. He told the King of all they had discussed. </p>
<p id="an4.188:5.2">But Ajātasattu became angry and upset, and said to Upaka, “How rude of this salt-maker’s boy! How scurrilous and impudent of him to imagine he could attack the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! Get out, Upaka, go away! Don’t let me see you again.” </p>

<p id="an4.190:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. </p>
<p id="an4.190:1.2">Now, at that time it was the sabbath, and the Buddha was sitting surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks. Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of mendicants, who were so very silent. He addressed them: </p>
<p id="an4.190:2.1">“This assembly has no nonsense, mendicants, it’s free of nonsense. It consists purely of the essential core. Such is this Saṅgha of mendicants, such is this assembly! An assembly such as this is rarely seen in the world. An assembly such as this is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world. For an assembly such as this, giving little becomes much, while giving much becomes even more. An assembly such as this is worth traveling many leagues to see, even if you have to carry your own provisions in a shoulder bag. </p>
<p id="an4.190:3.1">There are mendicants staying in this Saṅgha who have attained to the gods. There are mendicants staying in this Saṅgha who have attained to Brahmā. There are mendicants staying in this Saṅgha who have attained to the imperturbable. There are mendicants staying in this Saṅgha who have attained to nobility. </p>
<p id="an4.190:4.1">And how has a mendicant attained to the gods? It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption … That’s how a mendicant has attained to the gods. </p>
<p id="an4.190:5.1">And how has a mendicant attained to Brahmā? Firstly, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion … rejoicing … equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. That’s how a mendicant has attained to Brahmā. </p>
<p id="an4.190:6.1">And how has a mendicant attained to the imperturbable? It’s when a mendicant—going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity—aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, he enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, he enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness. Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, he enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. That’s how a mendicant has attained to the imperturbable. </p>
<p id="an4.190:7.1">And how has a mendicant attained to nobility? It’s when they truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. That’s how a mendicant has attained to nobility.” </p>

<p id="an4.193:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then Bhaddiya the Licchavi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an4.193:2.1">“Sir, I have heard this: ‘The ascetic Gotama is a magician. He knows a conversion magic, and uses it to convert the disciples of those of other religions.’ I trust that those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and do not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?” </p>
<p id="an4.193:3.1">“Please, Bhaddiya, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But when you know for yourselves: ‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering’, then you should give them up. </p>
<p id="an4.193:4.1">What do you think, Bhaddiya? Does greed come up in a person for their welfare or harm?” </p>
<p id="an4.193:4.3">“Harm, sir.” </p>
<p id="an4.193:4.4">“A greedy individual—overcome by greed—kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?” </p>

<p id="an4.193:5.3">“Harm, sir.” </p>
<p id="an4.193:5.4">“An aggressive individual kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?” </p>

<p id="an4.193:11.4">“Blameless, sir.” </p>
<p id="an4.193:11.5">“Criticized or praised by sensible people?” </p>
<p id="an4.193:11.6">“Praised by sensible people, sir.” </p>
<p id="an4.193:11.7">“When you undertake them, do they lead to welfare and happiness, or not? Or how do you see this?” </p>
<p id="an4.193:11.9">“When you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness. That’s how we see it.” </p>
<p id="an4.193:12.1">“So, Bhaddiya, when we said: ‘Please, Bhaddiya, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think “The ascetic is our respected teacher.” But when you know for yourselves: “These things are skillful, blameless, praised by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness”, then you should acquire them and keep them.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. </p>
<p id="an4.193:13.1">The true persons in the world encourage their disciples: ‘Please, mister, live rid of greed. Then you won’t act out of greed by way of body, speech, or mind. Live rid of hate … delusion … aggression. Then you won’t act out of hate … delusion … aggression by way of body, speech, or mind.” </p>
<p id="an4.193:14.1">When he said this, Bhaddiya the Licchavi said to the Buddha, “Excellent, sir! … From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>
<p id="an4.193:15.1">“Well, Bhaddiya, did I say to you: ‘Please, Bhaddiya, be my disciple, and I will be your teacher’?” </p>
<p id="an4.193:15.4">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="an4.193:15.5">“Though I state and assert this, certain ascetics and brahmins misrepresent me with the false, hollow, lying, untruthful claim: ‘The ascetic Gotama is a magician. He knows a conversion magic, and uses it to convert the disciples of those of other religions.’” </p>
<p id="an4.193:15.7">“Sir, this conversion magic is excellent. This conversion magic is lovely! If my loved ones—relatives and kin—were to be converted by this, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness. If all the aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials were to be converted by this, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.” </p>
<p id="an4.193:16.1">“That’s so true, Bhaddiya! That’s so true, Bhaddiya! If all the aristocrats, brahmins, peasants, and menials were to be converted by this, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness. If the whole world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—were to be converted by this, for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness. If these great sal trees were to be converted by this, for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness—if they were sentient. How much more then a human being!” </p>

<p id="an4.194:1.1">At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where they have a town named Sāpūga. Then several Koliyans from Sāpūga went up to Ānanda, bowed, and sat down to one side. Then Venerable Ānanda said to them: </p>
<p id="an4.194:2.1">“Byagghapajjas, these four factors of trying to be pure have been rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment. What four? The factors of trying to be pure in ethics, mind, view, and freedom. </p>
<p id="an4.194:3.1">And what is the factor of trying to be pure in ethics? It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. This is called purity of ethics. They think: ‘I will fulfill such purity of ethics, or, if it’s already fulfilled, I’ll support it in every situation by wisdom.’ Their enthusiasm for that—their effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness—is called the factor of trying to be pure in ethics. </p>
<p id="an4.194:4.1">And what is the factor of trying to be pure in mind? It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. This is called purity of mind. They think: ‘I will fulfill such purity of mind, or, if it’s already fulfilled, I’ll support it in every situation by wisdom.’ Their enthusiasm for that—their effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness—is called the factor of trying to be pure in mind. </p>
<p id="an4.194:5.1">And what is the factor of trying to be pure in view? Take a mendicant who truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. This is called purity of view. They think: ‘I will fulfill such purity of view, or, if it’s already fulfilled, I’ll support it in every situation by wisdom.’ Their enthusiasm for that—their effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness—is called the factor of trying to be pure in view. </p>
<p id="an4.194:6.1">And what is the factor of trying to be pure in freedom? That noble disciple—who has these factors of trying to be pure in ethics, mind, and view—detaches their mind from things that arouse greed, and frees their mind from things that it should be freed from. Doing so, they experience perfect freedom. This is called purity of freedom. They think: ‘I will fulfill such purity of freedom, or, if it’s already fulfilled, I’ll support it in every situation by wisdom.’ Their enthusiasm for that—their effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness—is called the factor of trying to be pure in freedom. </p>
<p id="an4.194:7.1">These four factors of trying to be pure have been rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment.” </p>

<p id="an4.195:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Then Vappa of the Sakyans, a disciple of the Jains, went up to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, bowed, and sat down to one side. Mahāmoggallāna said to him: </p>
<p id="an4.195:2.1">“Vappa, take a person who is restrained in body, speech, and mind. When ignorance fades away and knowledge arises, do you see any reason why defilements giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in the next life?” </p>
<p id="an4.195:2.3">“Sir, I do see such a case. Take a person who did bad deeds in a past life. But the result of that has not yet ripened. For this reason defilements giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in the next life.” But this conversation between Mahāmoggallāna and Vappa was left unfinished. </p>
<p id="an4.195:3.1">Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall. He sat down on the seat spread out, and said to Mahāmoggallāna, “Moggallāna, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?” </p>
<p id="an4.195:4.2">Moggallāna repeated the entire conversation to the Buddha, and concluded: “This was my conversation with Vappa that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.” </p>
<p id="an4.195:5.1">Then the Buddha said to Vappa, “Vappa, we can discuss this. But only if you allow what should be allowed, and reject what should be rejected. And if you ask me the meaning of anything you don’t understand, saying: ‘Sir, why is this? What’s the meaning of that?’” </p>
<p id="an4.195:5.4">“Sir, let us discuss this. I will do as you say.” </p>
<p id="an4.195:6.1">“What do you think, Vappa? There are distressing and feverish defilements that arise because of instigating bodily activity. These don’t occur in someone who avoids such bodily activity. They don’t perform any new deeds, and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by little. This wearing away is apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves. Do you see any reason why defilements giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in the next life?” </p>
<p id="an4.195:6.5">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="an4.195:7.1">“What do you think, Vappa? There are distressing and feverish defilements that arise because of instigating verbal activity. These don’t occur in someone who avoids such verbal activity. They don’t perform any new deeds, and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by little. This wearing away is apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves. Do you see any reason why defilements giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in the next life?” </p>
<p id="an4.195:7.6">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="an4.195:8.1">“What do you think, Vappa? There are distressing and feverish defilements that arise because of instigating mental activity.

<p id="an4.195:9.6">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="an4.195:10.1">“A mendicant whose mind is rightly freed like this has achieved six consistent responses. Seeing a sight with the eye, they’re neither happy nor sad, but remain equanimous, mindful and aware. Hearing a sound with the ears … Smelling an odor with the nose … Tasting a flavor with the tongue … Feeling a touch with the body … Knowing a thought with the mind, they’re neither happy nor sad, but remain equanimous, mindful and aware. Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’ They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, being no longer relished, will become cool right here.’ </p>
<p id="an4.195:11.1">Suppose there was a shadow cast by a sacrificial post. Then along comes a person with a spade and basket. They cut down the sacrificial post at its base, dig it up, and pull it out by its roots, right down to the fibers and stems. Then they split it apart, cut up the parts, and chop them into splinters. Next they dry the splinters in the wind and sun, burn them with fire, and reduce them to ashes. Then they sweep away the ashes in a strong wind, or float them away down a swift stream. And so the shadow cast by the post is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. </p>
<p id="an4.195:12.1">In the same way, a mendicant whose mind is rightly freed like this has achieved six consistent responses.

<p id="an4.195:13.1">When he said this, Vappa the Sakyan, the disciple of the Jains, said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="an4.195:13.2">“Sir, suppose there was a man who raised commercial horses for profit. But he never made any profit, and instead just got weary and frustrated. In the same way, I paid homage to those Jain fools for profit. But I never made any profit, and instead just got weary and frustrated. From this day forth, any confidence I had in those Jain fools I sweep away as in a strong wind, or float away as down a swift stream. </p>

<p id="an4.196:2.1">“There are, sir, some ascetics and brahmins who advocate crossing the flood by means of two things: purification of ethics, and mortification in disgust of sin. What does the Buddha say about this?” </p>
<p id="an4.196:3.1">“Sāḷha, purification of ethics is one of the factors of the ascetic life, I say. But those ascetics and brahmins who teach fervent mortification in disgust of sin—regarding it as essential and clinging to it—are incapable of crossing the flood. And those ascetics and brahmins whose livelihood and behavior by way of body, speech, and mind, is not pure are also incapable of knowing and seeing, of supreme awakening. </p>
<p id="an4.196:4.1">Suppose a man who wanted to cross a river took a sharp axe into a wood. There he’d see a large green sal tree, straight and young and grown free of defects. He’d cut it down at the base, cut off the top, and completely strip off the branches and foliage. Then he’d trim it with axes and machetes, plane it, and sand it with a rock. Finally, he’d launch out on the river. </p>
<p id="an4.196:5.1">What do you think, Sāḷha? Is that man capable of crossing the river?” </p>
<p id="an4.196:5.3">“No, sir. Why not? Because that green sal tree is well worked on the outside, but inside it’s still not cleared out. I’d expect that green sal tree to sink, and the man to come to ruin.” </p>

<p id="an4.197:2.1">“What is the cause, sir, what is the reason why in this life some females are ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking; and poor, with few assets and possessions; and insignificant? </p>
<p id="an4.197:3.1">And why are some females ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking; but rich, affluent, wealthy, and illustrious? </p>

<p id="an4.197:6.1">“Take a female who is irritable and bad-tempered.

She doesn’t give to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. And she’s jealous, envying, resenting, and begrudging the possessions, honor, respect, reverence, homage, and veneration given to others. If she comes back to this state of existence after passing away, wherever she is reborn she’s ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking; and poor, with few assets and possessions; and insignificant. </p>

<h4 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">AN 4.198</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">Fervent Mortification of Oneself </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Attantapasutta</span></h4>
<p id="an4.198:1.1">“Mendicants, these four people are found in the world. What four? </p>
<ol id="an4.198:1.3">
<li>One person mortifies themselves, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves. </li>
<li>One person mortifies others, pursuing the practice of mortifying others. </li>
<li>One person mortifies themselves and others, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves and others. </li>
<li>One person neither mortifies themselves nor others, pursuing the practice of not mortifying themselves or others. They live without wishes in the present life, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine. </li>
</ol>
<p id="an4.198:2.1">And how does one person mortify themselves, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves? It’s when someone goes naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on purpose for them, or an invitation for a meal. They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who has a man in her home; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or liquor or wine, and drink no beer. They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls. They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day. They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live pursuing the practice of eating food at set intervals. </p>
<p id="an4.198:3.1">They eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit. </p>
<p id="an4.198:4.1">They wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings. They tear out hair and beard, pursuing this practice. They constantly stand, refusing seats. They squat, committed to the endeavor of squatting. They lie on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns their bed. They pursue the practice of immersion in water three times a day, including the evening. And so they live pursuing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body. That’s how one person mortifies themselves, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves. </p>
<p id="an4.198:5.1">And how does one person mortify others, pursuing the practice of mortifying others? It’s when a person is a slaughterer of sheep, pigs, poultry, or deer, a hunter or fisher, a bandit, an executioner, a butcher of cattle, a jailer, or has some other cruel livelihood. That’s how one person mortifies others, pursuing the practice of mortifying others. </p>
<p id="an4.198:6.1">And how does one person mortify themselves and others, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves and others? It’s when a person is an anointed aristocratic king or a well-to-do brahmin. He has a new temple built to the east of the city. He shaves off his hair and beard, dresses in a rough antelope hide, and smears his body with ghee and oil. Scratching his back with antlers, he enters the temple with his chief queen and the brahmin high priest. There he lies on the bare ground strewn with grass. The king feeds on the milk from one teat of a cow that has a calf of the same color. The chief queen feeds on the milk from the second teat. The brahmin high priest feeds on the milk from the third teat. The milk from the fourth teat is served to the sacred flame. The calf feeds on the remainder. He says: ‘Slaughter this many bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, rams, and horses for the sacrifice! Fell this many trees and reap this much grass for the sacrificial equipment!’ His bondservants, employees, and workers do their jobs under threat of punishment and danger, weeping, with tearful faces. That’s how one person mortifies themselves and others, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves and others. </p>
<p id="an4.198:7.1">And how does one person neither mortify themselves nor others, pursuing the practice of not mortifying themselves or others, living without wishes in the present life, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine? It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in a good family. They gain faith in the Realized One and reflect: ‘Living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="an4.198:8.1">Once they’ve gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings. They give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving. They give up unchastity. They are celibate, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex. They give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and trustworthy, and don’t trick the world with their words. They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony. They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable, and agreeable to the people. They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial. </p>
<p id="an4.198:9.1">They refrain from injuring plants and seeds. They eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time. They refrain from seeing shows of dancing, singing, and music . They refrain from beautifying and adorning themselves with garlands, fragrance, and makeup. They refrain from high and luxurious beds. They refrain from receiving gold and money, raw grains, raw meat, women and girls, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants, cows, horses, and mares, and fields and land. They refrain from running errands and messages; buying and selling; falsifying weights, metals, or measures; bribery, fraud, cheating, and duplicity; mutilation, murder, abduction, banditry, plunder, and violence. </p>
<p id="an4.198:10.1">They’re content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden. In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves. </p>
<p id="an4.198:11.1">Seeing a sight with the eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving restraint over it. Hearing a sound with the ears … Smelling an odor with the nose … Tasting a flavor with the tongue … Feeling a touch with the body … Knowing a thought with the mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving restraint over it. When they have this noble sense restraint, they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves. </p>
<p id="an4.198:12.1">They act with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent. </p>
<p id="an4.198:13.1">When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness, they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in front of them. Giving up covetousness for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness. Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will. Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness. Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse. Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt. They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. </p>
<p id="an4.198:14.1">When their mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives … knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings … knowledge of the ending of defilements. They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’. </p>
<p id="an4.198:15.1">Knowing and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. </p>
<p id="an4.198:15.3">They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ That’s how one person neither mortifies themselves nor others, pursuing the practice of not mortifying themselves or others, living without wishes in the present life, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, with self become divine. </p>
<p id="an4.198:15.6">These are the four people found in the world.” </p>

<p id="an4.199:1.1">The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="an4.199:1.2">“Mendicants, I will teach you about craving—the weaver, the migrant, the creeping, the clinging. This world is choked by it, engulfed by it. It makes the world tangled like yarn, knotted like a ball of thread, and matted like rushes and reeds, not escaping the places of loss, the bad places, the underworld, transmigration. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="an4.199:1.4">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="an4.199:2.1">“And what is that craving …? There are eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior, and eighteen that derive from the exterior. </p>
<p id="an4.199:3.1">What are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior? When there is the concept ‘I am’, there are the concepts ‘I am such’, ‘I am thus’, ‘I am otherwise’; ‘I am fleeting’, ‘I am lasting’; ‘mine’, ‘such is mine’, ‘thus is mine’, ‘otherwise is mine’; ‘also mine’, ‘such is also mine’, ‘thus is also mine’, ‘otherwise is also mine’; ‘I will be’, ‘I will be such’, ‘I will be thus’, ‘I will be otherwise’. These are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior. </p>
<p id="an4.199:4.1">What are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the exterior? When there is the concept ‘I am because of this’, there are the concepts ‘I am such because of this’, ‘I am thus because of this’, ‘I am otherwise because of this’; ‘I am fleeting because of this’, ‘I am lasting because of this’; ‘mine because of this’, ‘such is mine because of this’, ‘thus is mine because of this’, ‘otherwise is mine because of this’; ‘also mine because of this’, ‘such is also mine because of this’, ‘thus is also mine because of this’, ‘otherwise is also mine because of this’; ‘I will be because of this’, ‘I will be such because of this’, ‘I will be thus because of this’, ‘I will be otherwise because of this’. These are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the exterior. </p>
<p id="an4.199:5.1">So there are eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior, and eighteen that derive from the exterior. These are called the thirty-six currents of craving. Each of these pertain to the past, future, and present, making one hundred and eight currents of craving. </p>
<p id="an4.199:6.1">This is that craving—the weaver, the migrant, the creeping, the clinging. This world is choked by it, engulfed by it. It makes the world tangled like yarn, knotted like a ball of thread, and matted like rushes and reeds, not escaping the places of loss, the bad places, the underworld, transmigration.” </p>

<li>Love is born of love, </li>
<li>hate is born of love, </li>
<li>love is born of hate, and </li>

</ol>
<p id="an4.200:2.1">And how is love born of love? It’s when someone likes, loves, and cares for a person. Others treat that person with liking, love, and care. They think: ‘These others like the person I like.’ And so love for them springs up. That’s how love is born of love. </p>
<p id="an4.200:3.1">And how is hate born of love? It’s when someone likes, loves, and cares for a person. Others treat that person with disliking, loathing, and detestation. They think: ‘These others dislike the person I like.’ And so hate for them springs up. That’s how hate is born of love. </p>
<p id="an4.200:4.1">And how is love born of hate? It’s when someone dislikes, loathes, and detests a person. Others treat that person with disliking, loathing, and detestation.

<p id="an4.200:5.8">These are the four things that are born of love and hate. </p>
<p id="an4.200:6.1">A time comes when a mendicant … enters and remains in the first absorption. At that time they have no love born of love, hate born of love, love born of hate, or hate born of hate. </p>
<p id="an4.200:7.1">A time comes when a mendicant … enters and remains in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. At that time they have no love born of love, hate born of love, love born of hate, or hate born of hate. </p>
<p id="an4.200:8.1">A time comes when a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. At that time any love born of love, hate born of love, love born of hate, or hate born of hate is given up, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. This is called a mendicant who doesn’t draw close or push back or fume or ignite or burn up. </p>
<p id="an4.200:9.1">And how does a mendicant draw close? It’s when a mendicant regards form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They regard feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in self, or self in feeling. They regard perception as self, self as having perception, perception in self, or self in perception. They regard choices as self, self as having choices, choices in self, or self in choices.

They don’t regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. That’s how a mendicant doesn’t draw close. </p>
<p id="an4.200:11.1">And how does a mendicant push back? It’s when someone abuses, annoys, or argues with a mendicant, and the mendicant abuses, annoys, or argues back at them. That’s how a mendicant pushes back. </p>
<p id="an4.200:12.1">And how does a mendicant not push back? It’s when someone abuses, annoys, or argues with a mendicant, and the mendicant doesn’t abuse, annoy, or argue back at them. That’s how a mendicant doesn’t push back. </p>
<p id="an4.200:13.1">And how does a mendicant fume? When there is the concept ‘I am’, there are the concepts ‘I am such’, ‘I am thus’, ‘I am otherwise’; ‘I am fleeting’, ‘I am lasting’; ‘mine’, ‘such is mine’, ‘thus is mine’, ‘otherwise is mine’; ‘also mine’, ‘such is also mine’, ‘thus is also mine’, ‘otherwise is also mine’; ‘I will be’, ‘I will be such’, ‘I will be thus’, ‘I will be otherwise’.

<p id="an4.243:1.4">“How could it be, sir? Venerable Anuruddha’s pupil Bāhiya remains entirely committed to creating a schism in the Saṅgha. But Anuruddha doesn’t think to say a single word about it.” </p>

He thinks: ‘Suppose the monks know that I have wrong view … If they’re in harmony they’ll expel me, but if they’re divided they won’t.’ A bad monk sees this as the second reason to relish schism in the Saṅgha. </p>

Shave his head and march him from street to street and square to square to the beating of a harsh drum. Then take him out the south gate and there, to the south of the city, chop off his head.’ The king’s men would do as they were told. Then a bystander might think: ‘This man must have done a truly bad and reprehensible deed, a capital offense. There’s no way I’d ever do such a bad and reprehensible deed, a capital offense.’ In the same way, take any monk or nun who has set up such an acute perception of peril regarding expulsion offenses.

That craving is given up by a mendicant, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future.

<p id="an5.1:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>
<p id="an5.1:1.5">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="an5.1:2.1">“Mendicants, there are these five powers of a trainee. What five? The powers of faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom. These are the five powers of a trainee. </p>
<p id="an5.1:3.1">So you should train like this: ‘We will have the trainee’s powers of faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom.’ That’s how you should train.” </p>

<p id="an5.2:1.1">“Mendicants, there are these five powers of a trainee. What five? The powers of faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom. </p>
<p id="an5.2:2.1">And what is the power of faith? It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ This is called the power of faith. </p>
<p id="an5.2:3.1">And what is the power of conscience? It’s when a noble disciple has a conscience. They’re conscientious about bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and conscientious about having any bad, unskillful qualities. This is called the power of conscience. </p>
<p id="an5.2:4.1">And what is the power of prudence? It’s when a noble disciple is prudent. They’re prudent when it comes to bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and prudent when it comes to acquiring any bad, unskillful qualities. This is called the power of prudence. </p>
<p id="an5.2:5.1">And what is the power of energy? It’s when a noble disciple lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. This is called the power of energy. </p>
<p id="an5.2:6.1">And what is the power of wisdom? It’s when a noble disciple is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. This is called the power of wisdom. These are the five powers of a trainee. </p>

What five? It’s when a mendicant is faithless, shameless, imprudent, lazy, and witless.

<p id="an5.7:1.1">“Mendicants, sentient beings are mostly charmed by sensual pleasures. When a gentleman has abandoned the scythe and flail and gone forth from the lay life to homelessness, they’re qualified to be called ‘a faithful renunciate from a good family’. Why is that? Because a youth can get sensual pleasures of this kind or that. Now, all sensual pleasures are just reckoned as ‘sensual pleasures’, regardless of whether they’re inferior, average, or superior. </p>
<p id="an5.7:1.6">Suppose there was a little baby boy who, because of his nurse’s negligence, puts a stick or stone in his mouth. The nurse would very quickly notice and try to take it out. If that didn’t work, she’d cradle his head with her left hand, and take it out using a hooked finger of her right hand, even if it drew blood. Why is that? I admit she’d know, ‘This will distress the child, there’s no denying.’ Still, it should be done by a nurse who wants what’s best for him, out of kindness and compassion. And when the boy has grown up and has enough sense, his nurse would not worry about him, thinking: ‘The boy can look after himself. He won’t be negligent.’ </p>
<p id="an5.7:2.1">In the same way, I still need to look after a mendicant who hasn’t finished developing faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom regarding skillful qualities. But when a mendicant has finished developing faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom regarding skillful qualities, I need not be concerned, thinking: ‘They can look after themselves. They won’t be negligent.’” </p>

It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ This is called the power of faith. </p>
<p id="an5.14:3.1">And what is the power of energy? It’s when a noble disciple lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. This is called the power of energy. </p>
<p id="an5.14:4.1">And what is the power of mindfulness? It’s when a noble disciple is mindful. They have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember and recall what was said and done long ago. This is called the power of mindfulness. </p>
<p id="an5.14:5.1">And what is the power of immersion? It’s when a noble disciple, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. This is called the power of immersion. </p>
<p id="an5.14:6.1">And what is the power of wisdom? It’s when a noble disciple is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. This is called the power of wisdom. </p>

<h4 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">AN 5.28</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">With Five Factors </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Pañcaṅgikasutta</span></h4>
<p id="an5.28:1.1">“Mendicants, I will teach you how to develop noble right immersion with five factors. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="an5.28:1.3">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="an5.28:2.1">“And how do you develop noble right immersion with five factors? </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an5.28:2.2">Firstly, a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption. It has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. It’s like when a deft bathroom attendant or their apprentice pours bath powder into a bronze dish, sprinkling it little by little with water. They knead it until the ball of bath powder is soaked and saturated with moisture, spread through inside and out; yet no moisture oozes out. In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of seclusion. This is the first way to develop noble right immersion with five factors. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an5.28:3.1">Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption. It has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion. It’s like a deep lake fed by spring water. There’s no inlet to the east, west, north, or south, and no rainfall to replenish it from time to time. But the stream of cool water welling up in the lake drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads throughout the lake. There’s no part of the lake that’s not spread through with cool water. In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with rapture and bliss born of immersion. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with rapture and bliss born of immersion. This is the second way to develop noble right immersion with five factors. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an5.28:4.1">Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption. They meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ They drench, steep, fill, and spread their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture. It’s like a pool with blue water lilies, or pink or white lotuses. Some of them sprout and grow in the water without rising above it, thriving underwater. From the tip to the root they’re drenched, steeped, filled, and soaked with cool water. There’s no part of them that’s not spread through with cool water. In the same way, a mendicant drenches, steeps, fills, and spreads their body with bliss free of rapture. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with bliss free of rapture. This is the third way to develop noble right immersion with five factors. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an5.28:5.1">Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption. It is without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. They sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind. It’s like someone sitting wrapped from head to foot with white cloth. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread over with white cloth. In the same way, they sit spreading their body through with pure bright mind. There’s no part of the body that’s not spread with pure bright mind. This is the fourth way to develop noble right immersion with five factors. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an5.28:6.1">Furthermore, the meditation that is a foundation for reviewing is properly grasped, focused on, borne in mind, and comprehended with wisdom by a mendicant. It’s like when someone views someone else. Someone standing might view someone sitting, or someone sitting might view someone lying down. In the same way, the meditation that is a foundation for reviewing is properly grasped, focused on, borne in mind, and comprehended with wisdom by a mendicant. This is the fifth way to develop noble right immersion with five factors. </p>
<p id="an5.28:7.1">When the noble right immersion with five factors is cultivated in this way, a mendicant becomes capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind, in each and every case. </p>
<p id="an5.28:8.1">Suppose a water jar was placed on a stand, full to the brim so a crow could drink from it. If a strong man was to tip it any which way, would water pour out?” </p>
<p id="an5.28:8.3">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an5.28:8.4">“In the same way, when noble right immersion with five factors is cultivated in this way, a mendicant becomes capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind, in each and every case. </p>
<p id="an5.28:9.1">Suppose there was a square, walled lotus pond on level ground, full to the brim so a crow could drink from it. If a strong man was to open the wall on any side, would water pour out?” </p>
<p id="an5.28:9.3">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an5.28:9.4">“In the same way, when noble right immersion with five factors is cultivated in this way, a mendicant becomes capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind, in each and every case. </p>
<p id="an5.28:10.1">Suppose a chariot stood harnessed to thoroughbreds at a level crossroads, with a goad ready. Then a deft horse trainer, a master charioteer, might mount the chariot, taking the reins in his right hand and goad in the left. He’d drive out and back wherever he wishes, whenever he wishes. In the same way, when noble right immersion with five factors is cultivated in this way, a mendicant becomes capable of realizing anything that can be realized by insight to which they extend the mind, in each and every case. </p>
<p id="an5.28:11.1">If you wish: ‘May I wield the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying myself and becoming one again … controlling the body as far as the Brahmā realm.’ You’re capable of realizing it, in each and every case. </p>
<p id="an5.28:12.1">If you wish: ‘With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, may I hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far.’ You’re capable of realizing it, in each and every case. </p>
<p id="an5.28:13.1">If you wish: ‘May I understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with my mind. May I understand mind with greed as “mind with greed”, and mind without greed as “mind without greed”; mind with hate as “mind with hate”, and mind without hate as “mind without hate”; mind with delusion as “mind with delusion”, and mind without delusion as “mind without delusion”; constricted mind as “constricted mind”, and scattered mind as “scattered mind”; expansive mind as “expansive mind”, and unexpansive mind as “unexpansive mind”; mind that is not supreme as “mind that is not supreme”, and mind that is supreme as “mind that is supreme”; mind immersed in samādhi as “mind immersed in samādhi”, and mind not immersed in samādhi as “mind not immersed in samādhi”; freed mind as “freed mind”, and unfreed mind as “unfreed mind”.’ You’re capable of realizing it, in each and every case. </p>
<p id="an5.28:14.1">If you wish: ‘May I recollect many kinds of past lives, with features and details.’ You’re capable of realizing it, in each and every case. </p>
<p id="an5.28:15.1">If you wish: ‘With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, may I see sentient beings passing away and being reborn according to their deeds.’ You’re capable of realizing it, in each and every case. </p>
<p id="an5.28:16.1">If you wish: ‘May I realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ You’re capable of realizing it, in each and every case.” </p>

<p id="an5.29:1.1">“Mendicants, there are five benefits of walking meditation. What five? You get fit for traveling, fit for striving in meditation, and healthy.

<p id="an5.30:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Icchānaṅgala. He stayed in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. The brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala heard: </p>
<p id="an5.30:1.5">“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala. He is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.” </p>
<p id="an5.30:1.11">Then, when the night had passed, they took many fresh and cooked foods and went to the forest near Icchānaṅgala, where they stood outside the gates making a dreadful racket. </p>
<p id="an5.30:2.1">Now, at that time Venerable Nāgita was the Buddha’s attendant. Then the Buddha said to Nāgita, “Nāgita, who’s making that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!” </p>
<p id="an5.30:2.4">“Sir, it’s these brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala. They’ve brought many fresh and cooked foods, and they’re standing outside the gates wanting to offer it specially to the Buddha and the mendicant Saṅgha.” </p>
<p id="an5.30:2.5">“Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to me. There are those who can’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can. Let them enjoy the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity.” </p>
<p id="an5.30:3.1">“Sir, may the Blessed One please relent now! May the Holy One relent! Now is the time for the Buddha to relent. Wherever the Buddha now goes, the brahmins and householders will incline the same way, as will the people of town and country. It’s like when it rains heavily and the water flows downhill. In the same way, wherever the Buddha now goes, the brahmins and householders will incline the same way, as will the people of town and country. Why is that? Because of the Buddha’s ethics and wisdom.” </p>
<p id="an5.30:4.1">“Nāgita, may I never become famous. May fame not come to me. There are those who can’t get the bliss of renunciation, the bliss of seclusion, the bliss of peace, the bliss of awakening when they want, without trouble or difficulty like I can. Let them enjoy the filthy, lazy pleasure of possessions, honor, and popularity. </p>
<p id="an5.30:4.4">What you eat, drink, chew, and taste ends up as excrement and urine. This is its outcome. </p>
<p id="an5.30:4.6">When loved ones decay and perish, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress arise. This is its outcome. </p>
<p id="an5.30:4.8">When you pursue meditation on the feature of ugliness, revulsion at the feature of beauty becomes stabilized. This is its outcome. </p>
<p id="an5.30:4.10">When you meditate observing impermanence in the six fields of contact, revulsion at contact becomes stabilized. This is its outcome. </p>
<p id="an5.30:4.12">When you meditate observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates, revulsion at grasping becomes stabilized. This is its outcome.” </p>

<p id="an5.31:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then Princess Sumanā, escorted by five hundred chariots and five hundred royal maidens, went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an5.31:2.1">“Sir, suppose there were two disciples equal in faith, ethics, and wisdom. One is a giver, one is not. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. When they have become gods, would there be any distinction or difference between them?” </p>
<p id="an5.31:3.1">“There would be, Sumanā,” said the Buddha. </p>
<p id="an5.31:3.2">“As a god, the one who was a giver would surpass the other in five respects: divine lifespan, beauty, happiness, fame, and sovereignty. As a god, the one who was a giver would surpass the other in these five respects.” </p>
<p id="an5.31:4.1">“But sir, if they pass away from there and come back to this state of existence as human beings, would there still be any distinction or difference between them?” </p>
<p id="an5.31:4.2">“There would be, Sumanā,” said the Buddha. </p>
<p id="an5.31:4.3">“As a human being, the one who was a giver would surpass the other in five respects: human lifespan, beauty, happiness, fame, and sovereignty. As a human being, the one who was a giver would surpass the other in these five respects.” </p>
<p id="an5.31:5.1">“But sir, if they both go forth from the lay life to homelessness, would there still be any distinction or difference between them?” </p>
<p id="an5.31:5.2">“There would be, Sumanā,” said the Buddha. </p>
<p id="an5.31:5.3">“As a renunciate, the one who was a giver would surpass the other in five respects. They’d usually use only what they’ve been invited to accept—robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—rarely using them without invitation. When living with other spiritual practitioners, they usually treat them agreeably by way of body, speech, and mind, rarely disagreeably. As a renunciate, the one who was a giver would surpass the other in these five respects.” </p>
<p id="an5.31:6.1">“But sir, if they both attain perfection, as perfected ones would there still be any distinction or difference between them?” </p>
<p id="an5.31:6.2">“In that case, I say there is no difference between the freedom of one and the freedom of the other.” </p>
<p id="an5.31:7.1">“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! This is quite enough to justify giving gifts and making merit. For merit is helpful for those who have become gods, human beings, and renunciates.” </p>
<p id="an5.31:7.4">“That’s so true, Sumanā. It’s quite enough to justify giving gifts and making merit. For merit is helpful for those who have become gods, human beings, and renunciates.” </p>
<p id="an5.31:8.1">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an5.31:9.1">“The moon so immaculate, <br/>journeying across the dimension of space; <br/>outshines with its radiance <br/>all the world’s stars. </p>
<p id="an5.31:10.1">So too, a faithful individual, <br/>perfect in ethics, <br/>outshines with their generosity <br/>all the world’s stingy people. </p>

<p id="an5.32:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. Then Princess Cundī, escorted by five hundred chariots and five hundred royal maidens, went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an5.32:2.1">“Sir, my brother, Prince Cunda, says this: ‘Take a woman or man who goes for refuge to the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. Only then do they get reborn in a good place, not a bad place, when their body breaks up, after death.’ And so I ask the Buddha: Sir, what kind of teacher should you have confidence in so as to be reborn in a good place, not a bad place, when the body breaks up, after death? Sir, what kind of teaching should you have confidence in so as to be reborn in a good place, not a bad place, when the body breaks up, after death? Sir, what kind of Saṅgha should you have confidence in so as to be reborn in a good place, not a bad place, when the body breaks up, after death? Sir, what kind of ethics should you fulfill so as to be reborn in a good place, not a bad place, when the body breaks up, after death?” </p>
<p id="an5.32:3.1">“Cundī, the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, is said to be the best of all sentient beings—be they footless, with two feet, four feet, or many feet; with form or formless; with perception or without perception or with neither perception nor non-perception. Those who have confidence in the Buddha have confidence in the best. Having confidence in the best, the result is the best. </p>
<p id="an5.32:4.1">The noble eightfold path is said to be the best of all conditioned things. Those who have confidence in the noble eightfold path have confidence in the best. Having confidence in the best, the result is the best. </p>

Those who have confidence in the teaching of fading away have confidence in the best. Having confidence in the best, the result is the best. </p>

Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Uggaha got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. </p>
<p id="an5.33:3.1">Then when the night had passed, the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Uggaha’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Uggaha served and satisfied the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods. </p>

<p id="an5.55:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>
<p id="an5.55:1.2">Now, at that time a mother and son had both entered the rainy season residence at Sāvatthī, as a monk and a nun. They wanted to see each other often. The mother wanted to see her son often, and the son his mother. Seeing each other often, they became close. Being so close, they became intimate. And being intimate, lust overcame them. With their minds swamped by lust, without resigning the training and declaring their inability to continue, they had sex. </p>
<p id="an5.55:2.1">Then several mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. </p>
<p id="an5.55:3.1">“Mendicants, how could that silly man imagine that a mother cannot lust for her son, or that a son cannot lust for his mother? Compared to the sight of a woman, I do not see a single sight that is so arousing, sensuous, intoxicating, captivating, and infatuating, and such an obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary from the yoke. Sentient beings are lustful, greedy, tied, infatuated, and attached to the sight of a woman. They sorrow for a long time under the sway of a woman’s sight. </p>
<p id="an5.55:4.1">Compared to the sound … smell … taste … touch of a woman, I do not see a single touch that is so arousing, sensuous, intoxicating, captivating, and infatuating, and such an obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary from the yoke. Sentient beings are lustful, greedy, tied, infatuated, and attached to the touch of a woman. They sorrow for a long time under the sway of a woman’s touch. </p>
<p id="an5.55:5.1">When a woman walks, she occupies a man’s mind. When a woman stands … sits … lies down … laughs … speaks … sings … cries … is injured, she occupies a man’s mind. Even when a woman is dead, she occupies a man’s mind. For if anyone should be rightly called ‘an all-round snare of Māra’, it’s females. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an5.55:6.1">You might chat with someone who has knife in hand. <br/>You might even chat with a goblin. <br/>You might sit close by a viper, <br/>whose bite would take your life. <br/>But never should you chat <br/>one on one with a female. </p>
<p id="an5.55:7.1">They captivate the unmindful <br/>with a glance and a smile. <br/>Or scantily clad, <br/>they speak charming words. <br/>It’s not good to sit with such a person, <br/>even if she’s injured or dead. </p>
<p id="an5.55:8.1">These five kinds of sensual stimulation <br/>are apparent in a woman’s body: <br/>sights, sounds, tastes, smells, <br/>and touches so delightful. </p>
<p id="an5.55:9.1">Those swept away by the flood of sensual pleasures, <br/>not comprehending them, <br/>are governed by transmigration—<br/>time and destination, and life after life. </p>
<p id="an5.55:10.1">But those who fully understand sensual pleasures <br/>live fearing nothing from any quarter. <br/>They are those in the world who’ve crossed over, <br/>having reached the ending of defilements.” </p>

<p id="an5.56:1.1">Then a mendicant went up to his own mentor, and said, “Now, sir, my body feels like it’s drugged. I’m disorientated, the teachings don’t spring to mind, and dullness and drowsiness fill my mind. I lead the spiritual life dissatisfied, and have doubts about the teachings.” </p>
<p id="an5.56:2.1">Then that mendicant took his pupil to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, this mendicant says this: ‘Now, sir, my body feels like it’s drugged. I’m disorientated, the teachings don’t spring to mind, and dullness and drowsiness fill my mind. I lead the spiritual life dissatisfied, and have doubts about the teachings.’” </p>
<p id="an5.56:3.1">“That’s how it is, mendicant, when your sense doors are unguarded, you eat too much, you’re not dedicated to wakefulness, you’re unable to discern skillful qualities, and you don’t pursue the development of the qualities that lead to awakening in the evening and toward dawn.

<p id="an5.56:4.1">When that mendicant had been given this advice by the Buddha, he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. </p>
<p id="an5.56:4.2">Then that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="an5.56:4.3">He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And that mendicant became one of the perfected. </p>
<p id="an5.56:5.1">When that mendicant had attained perfection, he went up to his own mentor, and said, “Now, sir, my body doesn’t feel like it’s drugged.

<p id="an5.58:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. </p>
<p id="an5.58:1.2">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Vesālī for alms. Then after the meal, on his return from almsround, he plunged deep into the Great Wood and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation. </p>
<p id="an5.58:2.1">Now at that time several Licchavi youths took strung bows and, escorted by a pack of hounds, were going for a walk in the Great Wood when they saw the Buddha seated at the root of a tree. When they saw him, they put down their strung bows, tied their hounds up to one side, and went up to him. They bowed and silently paid homage to the Buddha with joined palms. </p>
<p id="an5.58:3.1">Now at that time Mahānāma the Licchavi was going for a walk in the Great Wood when he saw those Licchavi youths silently paying homage to the Buddha with joined palms. Seeing this, he went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment, “They will become Vajjis! They will become Vajjis!” </p>
<p id="an5.58:4.1">“But Mahānāma, why do you say that they will become Vajjis?” </p>
<p id="an5.58:4.3">“Sir, these Licchavi youths are violent, harsh, and brash. Whenever sweets are left out for families—sugar-cane, jujube fruits, pancakes, pies, or fritters—they filch them and eat them up. And they hit women and girls of good families on their backs. But now they’re silently paying homage to the Buddha with joined palms.” </p>

It’s when a mendicant who has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut is approached by a female. She smiles, chats, laughs, and teases him. He falters and founders.

What is his ‘victory in battle’? It’s when a mendicant who has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut is approached by a female. She sits right by him, lies down, or embraces him. But he disentangles and frees himself, and goes wherever he wants. He frequents a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. </p>
<p id="an5.75:15.1">Gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, he sits down cross-legged, sets his body straight, and establishes mindfulness in front of him. Giving up covetousness for the world, he meditates with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness. Giving up ill will and malevolence, he meditates with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will. Giving up dullness and drowsiness, he meditates with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness. Giving up restlessness and remorse, he meditates without restlessness, his mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse. Giving up doubt, he meditates having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt. He gives up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, he enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. </p>
<p id="an5.75:16.1">When his mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—he extends it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements. He truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. He truly understands: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’. Knowing and seeing like this, his mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. When it is freed, he knows it is freed. </p>
<p id="an5.75:16.6">He understands: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ This is his ‘victory in battle’. </p>

With the simile of a skeleton … a scrap of meat … a grass torch … a pit of glowing coals … a dream … borrowed goods … fruit on a tree … a butcher’s knife and chopping block … a staking sword … a snake’s head, the Buddha says that sensual pleasures give little gratification and much suffering and distress, and they are all the more full of drawbacks. Be happy with the spiritual life. Venerable, please don’t declare your inability to continue training, reject it and return to a lesser life.’ </p>
<p id="an5.76:16.1">When thus advised and instructed by his spiritual companions, he says: ‘I’ll try, reverends, I’ll struggle, I’ll be happy. I won’t now declare my inability to continue training, reject it and return to a lesser life.’ </p>
<p id="an5.76:17.1">I say that this person is like the warrior who recovers from his injuries while in the care of his relatives. Some people are like that. This is the fourth person similar to a warrior found among the monks. </p>
<p id="an5.76:18.1">Furthermore, a mendicant lives supported by a town or village. He robes up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, enters a village or town, guarding body, speech, and mind, establishing mindfulness, and restraining the sense faculties. Seeing a sight with his eyes, he doesn’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, he practices restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving restraint over it. Hearing a sound with his ears … Smelling an odor with his nose … Tasting a flavor with his tongue … Feeling a touch with his body … Knowing a thought with his mind, he doesn’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, he practices restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving restraint over it. Then after the meal, on his return from almsround, he frequents a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. Gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, he sits down cross-legged, sets his body straight, and establishes mindfulness in front of him. He gives up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, he enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. </p>
<p id="an5.76:19.1">When his mind has become immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—he extends it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements. He truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. He truly understands: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’. Knowing and seeing like this, his mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. When freed, he knows ‘it is freed’. He understands: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ </p>
<p id="an5.76:20.1">I say that this person is like the warrior who dons his sword and shield, fastens his bow and arrows, and plunges into the thick of battle. He wins victory in battle, establishing himself as foremost in battle. Some people are like that. This is the fifth person similar to a warrior found among the monks. </p>
<p id="an5.76:20.4">These five people similar to warriors are found among the monks.” </p>

<p id="an5.78:1.3">A mendicant reflects: ‘Currently I’m a youth, young, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life. But there will come a time when this body is struck with old age. When you’re old, overcome by old age, it’s not easy to focus on the instructions of the Buddhas, and it’s not easy to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.

But there will come a time of famine, a bad harvest, when it’s hard to get almsfood, and not easy to keep going by collecting alms. In a time of famine, people move to where there’s plenty of food, where they live crowded and cramped together.

In a time of peril, people move to where there’s sanctuary, where they live crowded and cramped together.

<p id="an5.100:1.3">At that time the Koliyan named Kakudha—Venerable Mahāmoggallāna’s supporter—had recently passed away and been reborn in a certain host of mind-made gods. He was reincarnated in a life-form that was two or three times the size of a Magadhan village with its fields. But with that life-form he didn’t obstruct himself or others. </p>
<p id="an5.100:2.1">Then the god Kakudha went up to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, “Sir, this fixed desire arose in Devadatta: ‘I shall lead the mendicant Saṅgha.’ And as that thought arose, Devadatta lost that psychic power.” </p>
<p id="an5.100:2.5">That’s what the god Kakudha said. Then he bowed and respectfully circled Mahāmoggallāna, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there. </p>
<p id="an5.100:3.1">Then Mahāmoggallāna went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. </p>

<p id="an5.140:1.1">“Mendicants, a royal bull elephant with five factors is worthy of a king, fit to serve a king, and is considered a factor of kingship. What five? A royal bull elephant listens, destroys, protects, endures, and goes fast. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an5.140:2.1">And how does a royal bull elephant listen? It’s when a royal bull elephant pays attention, applies the mind, concentrates wholeheartedly, and actively listens to whatever task the elephant trainer has it do, whether or not it has done it before. That’s how a royal bull elephant listens. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an5.140:3.1">And how does a royal bull elephant destroy? It’s when a royal bull elephant in battle destroys elephants with their riders, horses with their riders, chariots and charioteers, and foot soldiers. That’s how a royal bull elephant destroys. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an5.140:4.1">And how does a royal bull elephant protect? It’s when a royal bull elephant in battle protects its fore-quarters and hind-quarters, its fore-feet and hind-feet, and its head, ears, tusks, trunk, tail, and rider. That’s how a royal bull elephant protects. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an5.140:5.1">And how does a royal bull elephant endure? It’s when a royal bull elephant in battle endures being struck by spears, swords, arrows, and axes; it endures the thunder of the drums, kettledrums, horns, and cymbals. That’s how a royal bull elephant endures. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an5.140:6.1">And how does a royal bull elephant go fast? It’s when a royal bull elephant swiftly goes in whatever direction the elephant trainer sends it, whether or not it has been there before. That’s how a royal bull elephant goes fast. </p>
<p id="an5.140:7.1">A royal bull elephant with these five factors is worthy of a king, fit to serve a king, and is considered a factor of kingship. </p>
<p id="an5.140:8.1">In the same way, a mendicant with five qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world. What five? A mendicant listens, destroys, protects, endures, and goes fast. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an5.140:9.1">And how does a mendicant listen? It’s when a mendicant pays attention, applies the mind, concentrates wholeheartedly, and actively listens when the teaching and training proclaimed by a Realized One is being taught. That’s how a mendicant listens. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an5.140:10.1">And how does a mendicant destroy? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought. They don’t tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, calm them, eliminate them, and obliterate them. That’s how a mendicant destroys. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an5.140:11.1">And how does a mendicant protect? When a mendicant sees a sight with the eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving restraint over it. Hearing a sound with the ears … Smelling an odor with the nose … Tasting a flavor with the tongue … Feeling a touch with the body … Knowing a thought with the mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving restraint over it. That’s how a mendicant protects. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an5.140:12.1">And how does a mendicant endure? It’s when a mendicant endures cold, heat, hunger, and thirst; the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; rude and unwelcome criticism; and puts up with physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening. That’s how a mendicant endures. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an5.140:13.1">And how does a mendicant go fast? It’s when a mendicant swiftly goes in the direction they’ve never gone before in all this long time; that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment. That’s how a mendicant goes fast. </p>

They might think: ‘This little bit of water is in a cow’s hoofprint. If I drink it with my cupped hands or a bowl, I’ll stir it and disturb it, making it undrinkable. Why don’t I get down on all fours and drink it up like a cow, then be on my way?’ So that’s what they do.

And they didn’t have any suitable food or medicine, or a competent carer, or someone to bring them within a village. Then another person traveling along the road sees them, and thinks of them with nothing but compassion, kindness, and sympathy: ‘Oh, may this person get suitable food or medicine, or a competent carer, or someone to bring them within a village. Why is that? So that they don’t come to ruin right here.’ In the same way, at that time you should ignore that person’s impure behavior by way of speech and body, and the fact that they don’t get an openness and clarity of heart from time to time, and think of them with nothing but compassion, kindness, and sympathy: ‘Oh, may this person give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. Why is that? So that, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re not reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’ That’s how to get rid of resentment for that person. </p>

<p id="an5.166:11.1">Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda! There’s a senior mendicant being harassed, and you just watch it happening. Don’t you have any compassion for a senior mendicant who is being harassed?” </p>
<p id="an5.166:12.1">Then the Buddha addressed the mendicants: </p>
<p id="an5.166:12.2">“Mendicants, take a mendicant who is accomplished in ethics, immersion, and wisdom. They might enter into and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. That is possible. If they don’t reach enlightenment in this very life, they’re reborn in the company of a certain host of mind-made gods, who surpass the gods that consume solid food. There they might enter into and emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling. That is possible.” </p>
<p id="an5.166:12.6">That is what the Buddha said. When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. </p>
<p id="an5.166:13.1">Then, not long after the Buddha had left, Venerable Ānanda went to Venerable Upavāna and said to him, “Reverend Upavāna, they’ve been harassing other senior mendicants, but I didn’t question them. I wouldn’t be surprised if the Buddha brings this up when he comes out of retreat later this afternoon. He might even call upon Venerable Upavāna himself. And right now I feel timid.” </p>
<p id="an5.166:13.6">Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall, where he sat on the seat spread out, and said to Upavāna, “Upavāna, how many qualities should a senior mendicant have to be dear and beloved to their spiritual companions, respected and admired?” </p>
<p id="an5.166:14.2">“Sir, a senior mendicant with five qualities is dear and beloved to their spiritual companions, respected and admired. What five? </p>
<p id="an5.166:14.4">It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. </p>
<p id="an5.166:14.5">They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s totally full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reciting them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically. </p>
<p id="an5.166:14.6">They’re a good speaker, with a polished, clear, and articulate voice that expresses the meaning. </p>
<p id="an5.166:14.7">They get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty. </p>
<p id="an5.166:14.8">They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. </p>
<p id="an5.166:14.9">A senior mendicant with these five qualities is dear and beloved to their spiritual companions, respected and admired.” </p>
<p id="an5.166:15.1">“Good, good, Upavāna! A senior mendicant with these five qualities is dear and beloved to their spiritual companions, respected and admired. If these five qualities are not found in a senior mendicant, why would their spiritual companions honor, respect, revere, or venerate them? Because of their broken teeth, gray hair, and wrinkled skin? But since these five qualities are found in a senior mendicant, their spiritual companions honor, respect, revere, or venerate them.” </p>

<p id="an5.167:2.1">What five? I will speak at the right time, not at the wrong time. I will speak truthfully, not falsely. I will speak gently, not harshly. I will speak beneficially, not harmfully. I will speak lovingly, not from secret hate. A mendicant who wants to accuse another should first establish these five things in themselves. </p>
<p id="an5.167:3.1">Take a case where I see a certain person being accused at the wrong time, not being disturbed at the right time. They’re accused falsely, not disturbed truthfully. They’re accused harshly, not disturbed gently. They’re accused harmfully, not disturbed beneficially. They’re accused with secret hate, not disturbed lovingly. </p>
<p id="an5.167:4.1">The mendicant who is accused improperly should be reassured in five ways. ‘Venerable, you were accused at the wrong time, not at the right time. There’s no need for you to feel remorse. You were accused falsely, not truthfully. … You were accused harshly, not gently. … You were accused harmfully, not beneficially. … You were accused with secret hate, not lovingly. There’s no need for you to feel remorse.’ A mendicant who is accused improperly should be reassured in these five ways. </p>
<p id="an5.167:5.1">The mendicant who makes improper accusations should be chastened in five ways. ‘Reverend, you made an accusation at the wrong time, not at the right time. There’s a reason for you to feel remorse. You made an accusation falsely, not truthfully. … You made an accusation harshly, not gently. … You made an accusation harmfully, not beneficially. … You made an accusation with secret hate, not lovingly. There’s a reason for you to feel remorse.’ The mendicant who makes improper accusations should be chastened in these five ways. Why is that? So that another mendicant wouldn’t think to make a false accusation. </p>
<p id="an5.167:6.1">Take a case where I see a certain person being accused at the right time, not being disturbed at the wrong time. They’re accused truthfully, not disturbed falsely.

So that another mendicant would think to make a true accusation. </p>
<p id="an5.167:9.1">A person who is accused should ground themselves in two things: truth and an even temper. Even if others accuse me—at the right time or the wrong time, truthfully or falsely, gently or harshly, beneficially or harmfully, lovingly or with secret hate—I will still ground myself in two things: truth and an even temper. If I know that that quality is found in me, I will tell them that it is. If I know that that quality is not found in me, I will tell them that it is not.” </p>
<p id="an5.167:10.1">“Even when you speak like this, Sāriputta, there are still some foolish people here who do not respectfully take it up.” </p>
<p id="an5.167:11.1">“Sir, there are those faithless people who went forth from the lay life to homelessness not out of faith but to earn a livelihood. They’re devious, deceitful, and sneaky. They’re restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, and loose-tongued. They do not guard their sense doors or eat in moderation, and they are not dedicated to wakefulness. They don’t care about the ascetic life, and don’t keenly respect the training. They’re indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, lazy, and lacking energy. They’re unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds, witless and stupid. When I speak to them like this, they don’t respectfully take it up. </p>

<p id="an5.179:1.1">Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, escorted by around five hundred lay followers, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta: </p>
<p id="an5.179:1.3">“You should know this, Sāriputta, about those white-clothed laypeople whose actions are restrained in the five precepts, and who get four blissful meditations in the present life belonging to the higher mind when they want, without trouble or difficulty. They may, if they wish, declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’ </p>
<p id="an5.179:2.1">And what are the five precepts in which their actions are restrained? It’s when a noble disciple doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or use alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. These are the five precepts in which their actions are restrained. </p>
<p id="an5.179:3.1">And what are the four blissful meditations in the present life belonging to the higher mind that they get when they want, without trouble or difficulty? </p>
<p id="an5.179:3.2">It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ This is the first blissful meditation in the present life belonging to the higher mind, which they achieve in order to purify the unpurified mind and cleanse the unclean mind. </p>
<p id="an5.179:4.1">Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ This is the second blissful meditation … </p>
<p id="an5.179:5.1">Furthermore, a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ This is the third blissful meditation … </p>
<p id="an5.179:6.1">Furthermore, a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. This is the fourth blissful meditation in the present life belonging to the higher mind, which they achieve in order to purify the unpurified mind and cleanse the unclean mind. These are the four blissful meditations in the present life belonging to the higher mind that they get when they want, without trouble or difficulty. </p>

<p id="an5.179:8.1">Seeing the peril in the hells, <br/>you should shun bad deeds. <br/>Taking up the teaching of the noble ones, <br/>an astute person should shun them. </p>

<p id="an5.180:1.1">At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. While traveling along a road the Buddha saw a large sal grove in a certain spot. He left the road, went to the sal grove, and plunged deep into it. And at a certain spot he smiled. </p>
<p id="an5.180:2.1">Then Venerable Ānanda thought, “What is the cause, what is the reason why the Buddha smiled? Realized Ones do not smile for no reason.” </p>
<p id="an5.180:2.4">So Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, “What is the cause, what is the reason why the Buddha smiled? Realized Ones do not smile for no reason.” </p>
<p id="an5.180:3.1">“Once upon a time, Ānanda, there was a city in this spot that was successful and prosperous, populous, full of people. And Kassapa, a blessed one, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, lived supported by that city. </p>
<p id="an5.180:3.3">He had a lay follower called Gavesī who had not fulfilled all the precepts. And the five hundred lay followers who were taught and advised by Gavesī also had not fulfilled all the precepts. Then Gavesī thought: ‘I’m the helper, leader, and adviser of these five hundred lay followers, yet neither I nor they have fulfilled the precepts. We’re the same, I’m in no way better. So let me do better.’ </p>
<p id="an5.180:4.1">Then Gavesī went to those five hundred lay followers and said to them: ‘From this day forth may the venerables remember me as one who has fulfilled the precepts.’ Then those five hundred lay followers thought: ‘The venerable Gavesī is our helper, leader, and adviser, and now he will fulfill the precepts. Why don’t we do the same?’ Then those five hundred lay followers went to Gavesī and said to him: ‘From this day forth may Venerable Gavesī remember these five hundred lay followers as having fulfilled the precepts.’ </p>
<p id="an5.180:4.9">Then Gavesī thought: ‘I’m the helper, leader, and adviser of these five hundred lay followers, and both I and they have fulfilled the precepts. We’re the same, I’m in no way better. So let me do better.’ </p>
<p id="an5.180:5.1">Then Gavesī went to those five hundred lay followers and said to them: ‘From this day forth may the venerables remember me as one who is celibate, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex.’ Then those five hundred lay followers did the same. … </p>
<p id="an5.180:5.9">Then Gavesī thought: ‘These five hundred lay followers … are celibate, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex. We’re the same, I’m in no way better. So let me do better.’ </p>
<p id="an5.180:6.1">Then Gavesī went to those five hundred lay followers and said to them: ‘From this day forth may the venerables remember me as one who eats in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night, and from food at the wrong time.’ Then those five hundred lay followers did the same. … </p>
<p id="an5.180:6.9">Then Gavesī thought: ‘These five hundred lay followers … eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night, and food at the wrong time. We’re the same, I’m in no way better. So let me do better.’ </p>
<p id="an5.180:7.1">Then the lay follower Gavesī went up to the blessed one Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha and said to him: ‘Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?’ And he received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. Not long after his ordination, the mendicant Gavesī, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="an5.180:7.5">He understood: ‘Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.’ And the mendicant Gavesī became one of the perfected. </p>
<p id="an5.180:8.1">Then those five hundred lay followers thought: ‘Venerable Gavesī is our helper, leader, and adviser, He has shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and gone forth from the lay life to homelessness. Why don’t we do the same?’ Then those five hundred lay followers went up to the blessed one Kassapa, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha and said to him: ‘Sir, may we receive the going forth and ordination in the Buddha’s presence?’ And they did receive the going forth and ordination in the Buddha’s presence. </p>
<p id="an5.180:9.1">Then the mendicant Gavesī thought: ‘I get the supreme bliss of freedom whenever I want, without trouble or difficulty. Oh, may these five hundred mendicants do the same!’ Then those five hundred mendicants, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. They lived having achieved with their own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="an5.180:9.6">They understood: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ </p>
<p id="an5.180:10.1">And so, Ānanda, those five hundred mendicants headed by Gavesī, trying to go higher and higher, better and better, realized the supreme bliss of freedom. So you should train like this: ‘Trying to go higher and higher, better and better, we will realize the supreme bliss of freedom.’ That’s how you should train.” </p>

<p id="an5.192:1.1">Then Doṇa the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, Doṇa sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="an5.192:2.1">“Master Gotama, I have heard that the ascetic Gotama doesn’t bow to old brahmins, the elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat. And this is indeed the case, for Master Gotama does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat. This is not appropriate, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="an5.192:2.6">“Doṇa, do you too claim to be a brahmin?” </p>
<p id="an5.192:2.7">“Master Gotama, if anyone should be rightly called a brahmin, it’s me. For I am well born on both my mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy back to the seventh paternal generation. I recite and remember the hymns, and have mastered the three Vedas, together with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology and etymology, and the testament as fifth. I know philology and grammar, and am well versed in cosmology and the marks of a great man.” </p>
<p id="an5.192:3.1">“Doṇa, the ancient brahmin seers were Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu. They were the authors and propagators of the hymns, whose hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times. These days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it. They continue chanting what was chanted, reciting what was recited, and teaching what was taught. Those seers described five kinds of brahmins. A brahmin who is equal to Brahmā, one who is equal to a god, one who toes the line, one who crosses the line, and the fifth is a brahmin outcaste. Which one of these are you, Doṇa?” </p>
<p id="an5.192:4.1">“Master Gotama, we don’t know about these five kinds of brahmins. We just know the word ‘brahmin’. Master Gotama, please teach me this matter so I can learn about these five brahmins.” </p>
<p id="an5.192:4.3">“Well then, brahmin, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="an5.192:4.4">“Yes sir,” Doṇa replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="an5.192:5.1">“Doṇa, how is a brahmin equal to Brahmā? </p>
<p id="an5.192:5.2">It’s when a brahmin is well born on both the mother’s and the father’s sides, coming from a clean womb back to the seventh paternal generation, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy. For forty-eight years he leads the boy’s spiritual life studying the hymns. Then he seeks a fee for his teacher, but only by legitimate means, not illegitimate. </p>
<p id="an5.192:6.1">In this context, Doṇa, what is legitimate? Not by farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions, but solely by living on alms, not scorning the alms bowl. Having offered the fee to his teacher, he shaves off his hair and beard, dresses in ocher robes, and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="an5.192:6.4">Then they meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion … rejoicing … equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Having developed these four divine meditations, when the body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a divine realm of Brahmā. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an5.192:6.9">That’s how a brahmin is equal to Brahmā. </p>
<p id="an5.192:7.1">And how is a brahmin equal to a god? </p>
<p id="an5.192:7.2">It’s when a brahmin is well born on both the mother’s and the father’s sides … Having offered the fee to his teacher, he seeks a wife, but only by legitimate means, not illegitimate. </p>
<p id="an5.192:8.1">In this context, Doṇa, what is legitimate? Not by buying or selling, he only accepts a brahmin woman by the pouring of water. He has sex only with a brahmin woman. He does not have sex with a woman from a caste of aristocrats, peasants, menials, outcastes, hunters, bamboo-workers, chariot-makers, or waste-collectors. Nor does he have sex with women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or outside the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle. </p>
<p id="an5.192:8.4">And why does the brahmin not have sex with a pregnant woman? If a brahmin had sex with a pregnant woman, the boy or girl would be born in too much filth. That’s why the brahmin doesn’t have sex with a pregnant woman. </p>
<p id="an5.192:8.7">And why does the brahmin not have sex with a breastfeeding woman? If a brahmin had sex with a breastfeeding woman, the boy or girl would drink back the semen. That’s why the brahmin doesn’t have sex with a breastfeeding woman. </p>
<p id="an5.192:8.10">And why does the brahmin not have sex outside the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle? Because his brahmin wife is not there for sensual pleasure, fun, and enjoyment, but only for procreation. Having ensured his progeny through sex, he shaves off his hair and beard, dresses in ocher robes, and goes forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="an5.192:8.12">When he has gone forth, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, he enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. Having developed these four absorptions, when the body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an5.192:8.14">That’s how a brahmin is equal to god. </p>
<p id="an5.192:9.1">And how does a brahmin toe the line? </p>
<p id="an5.192:9.2">It’s when a brahmin is well born on both the mother’s and the father’s sides … </p>
<p id="an5.192:10.1">Not by buying or selling, he only accepts a brahmin woman by the pouring of water. Having ensured his progeny through sex, his child makes him happy. Because of this attachment he stays in his family property, and does not go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="an5.192:10.12">As far as the line of the ancient brahmins extends, he doesn’t cross over it. That’s why he’s called a brahmin who toes the line. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an5.192:10.14">That’s how a brahmin toes the line. </p>
<p id="an5.192:11.1">And how does a brahmin cross the line? </p>
<p id="an5.192:11.2">It’s when a brahmin is well born on both the mother’s and the father’s sides … </p>
<p id="an5.192:12.1">Having offered a fee for his teacher, he seeks a wife by both legitimate and illegitimate means. That is, by buying or selling, as well as accepting a brahmin woman by the pouring of water. He has sex with a brahmin woman, as well as with a woman from a caste of aristocrats, peasants, menials, outcastes, hunters, bamboo workers, chariot-makers, or waste-collectors. And he has sex with women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or outside the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle. His brahmin wife is there for sensual pleasure, fun, and enjoyment, as well as for procreation. </p>
<p id="an5.192:12.6">As far as the line of the ancient brahmins extends, he crosses over it. That’s why he’s called a brahmin who crosses the line. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an5.192:12.8">That’s how a brahmin crosses the line. </p>
<p id="an5.192:13.1">And how is a brahmin a brahmin outcaste? </p>
<p id="an5.192:13.2">It’s when a brahmin is well born on both the mother’s and the father’s sides, coming from a clean womb back to the seventh paternal generation, with irrefutable and impeccable genealogy. For forty-eight years he leads the virginal spiritual life studying the hymns. Then he seeks a fee for his teacher by legitimate means and illegitimate means. By farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions, not solely by living on alms, not scorning the alms bowl. </p>
<p id="an5.192:14.1">Having offered a fee for his teacher, he seeks a wife by both legitimate and illegitimate means. That is, by buying or selling, as well as accepting a brahmin woman by the pouring of water. He has sex with a brahmin woman, as well as with a woman from a caste of aristocrats, peasants, menials, outcastes, hunters, bamboo workers, chariot-makers, or waste-collectors. And he has sex with women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or outside the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle. His brahmin wife is there for sensual pleasure, fun, and enjoyment, as well as for procreation. </p>
<p id="an5.192:14.4">He earns a living by any kind of work. The brahmins say to him, ‘My good man, why is it that you claim to be a brahmin, but you earn a living by any kind of work?’ </p>
<p id="an5.192:14.7">He says, ‘It’s like a fire that burns both pure and filthy substances, but doesn’t become corrupted by them. In the same way, my good man, if a brahmin earns a living by any kind of work, he is not corrupted by that.’ </p>
<p id="an5.192:14.10">A brahmin is called a brahmin outcaste because he earns a living by any kind of work. </p>
<p id="an5.192:14.11">That’s how a brahmin is a brahmin outcaste. </p>
<p id="an5.192:15.1">Doṇa, the ancient brahmin seers were Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamadaggi, Aṅgīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu. They were the authors and propagators of the hymns, whose hymnal was sung and propagated and compiled in ancient times. These days, brahmins continue to sing and chant it. They continue chanting what was chanted, reciting what was recited, and teaching what was taught. </p>
<p id="an5.192:15.2">Those seers described five kinds of brahmins. A brahmin who is equal to Brahmā, one who is equal to a god, one who toes the line, one who crosses the line, and the fifth is a brahmin outcaste. Which one of these are you, Doṇa?” </p>
<p id="an5.192:16.1">“This being so, Master Gotama, I don’t even qualify as a brahmin outcaste. </p>
<p id="an5.192:16.2">Excellent, Master Gotama! … From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<p id="an5.194:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. </p>
<p id="an5.194:1.2">Now at that time the brahmin Kāraṇapālī was working for the Licchavis. He saw the brahmin Piṅgiyānī coming off in the distance and said to him, “So, Piṅgiyānī, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?” </p>
<p id="an5.194:2.2">“I’m coming, my good man, from the presence of the ascetic Gotama.” </p>
<p id="an5.194:2.3">“What do you think of the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom? Do you think he’s astute?” </p>
<p id="an5.194:2.4">“My good man, who am I to judge the ascetic Gotama’s lucidity of wisdom? You’d really have to be on the same level to judge his lucidity of wisdom.” </p>
<p id="an5.194:2.6">“Master Piṅgiyānī praises the ascetic Gotama with magnificent praise indeed.” </p>
<p id="an5.194:2.7">“Who am I to praise the ascetic Gotama? He is praised by the praised as the first among gods and humans.” </p>
<p id="an5.194:2.9">“But for what reason are you so devoted to the ascetic Gotama?” </p>
<p id="an5.194:3.1">“Suppose a person was completely satisfied by the best tasting food. They wouldn’t be attracted to anything that tasted inferior. In the same way, when you hear the ascetic Gotama’s teaching—whatever it may be, whether statements, mixed prose & verse, discussions, or amazing stories—then you’re not attracted to the doctrines of the various ascetics and brahmins. </p>
<p id="an5.194:4.1">Suppose a person who was weak with hunger was to obtain a honey-cake. Wherever they taste it, they would enjoy a sweet, delicious flavor. In the same way, when you hear the ascetic Gotama’s teaching—whatever it may be, whether statements, mixed prose & verse, discussions, or amazing stories—then you get a sense of uplift, a confidence of the heart. </p>
<p id="an5.194:5.1">Suppose a person were to obtain a piece of sandalwood, whether yellow or red. Wherever they smelled it—whether at the root, the middle, or the top—they’d enjoy a delicious fragrance. In the same way, when you hear the ascetic Gotama’s teaching—whatever it may be, whether statements, mixed prose & verse, discussions, or amazing stories—then you become filled with joy and happiness. </p>
<p id="an5.194:6.1">Suppose there was a person who was sick, suffering, gravely ill. A good doctor would cure them on the spot. In the same way, when you hear the ascetic Gotama’s teaching—whatever it may be, whether statements, mixed prose & verse, discussions, or amazing stories—then you make an end of sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. </p>
<p id="an5.194:7.1">Suppose there was a lotus pond with clear, sweet, cool water, clean, with smooth banks, delightful. Then along comes a person struggling in the oppressive heat, weary, thirsty, and parched. They’d plunge into the lotus pond to bathe and drink. And all their stress, weariness, and heat exhaustion would die down. In the same way, when you hear the ascetic Gotama’s teaching—whatever it may be, whether statements, mixed prose & verse, discussions, or amazing stories—then all your stress, weariness, and exhaustion die down.” </p>
<p id="an5.194:8.1">When this was said, the brahmin Kāraṇapālī got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, knelt on his right knee, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and expressed this heartfelt sentiment three times: </p>
<p id="an5.194:9.1">“Homage to that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! </p>

As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, Master Piṅgiyānī has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Piṅgiyānī remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<p id="an5.195:2.1">Then the brahmin Piṅgīyānī got up from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward the Buddha, and said, “I feel inspired to speak, Blessed One! I feel inspired to speak, Holy One!” </p>
<p id="an5.195:2.3">“Then speak as you feel inspired,” said the Buddha. So the brahmin Piṅgīyānī extolled the Buddha in his presence with a fitting verse. </p>

<p id="an5.195:5.2">“Licchavis, the appearance of five treasures is rare in the world. What five? A Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha. A person who explains the teaching and training proclaimed by a Realized One. A person who understands the teaching and training proclaimed by a Realized One.

<p id="an5.200:1.1">“Mendicants, there are these five elements of escape. What five? </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an5.200:1.3">Take a case where a mendicant focuses on sensual pleasures, but their mind isn’t secure, confident, settled, and decided about them. But when they focus on renunciation, their mind is secure, confident, settled, and decided about it. Their mind is in a good state, well developed, well risen, well freed, and well detached from sensual pleasures. They’re freed from the distressing and feverish defilements that arise because of sensual pleasures, so they don’t experience that kind of feeling. This is how the escape from sensual pleasures is explained. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an5.200:2.1">Take another case where a mendicant focuses on ill will, but their mind isn’t secure … But when they focus on good will, their mind becomes secure … Their mind is in a good state … well detached from ill will. They’re freed from the distressing and feverish defilements that arise because of ill will, so they don’t experience that kind of feeling. This is how the escape from ill will is explained. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an5.200:3.1">Take another case where a mendicant focuses on harming, but their mind isn’t secure … But when they focus on compassion, their mind is eager … Their mind is in a good state … well detached from harming. They’re freed from the distressing and feverish defilements that arise because of harming, so they don’t experience that kind of feeling. This is how the escape from harming is explained. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an5.200:4.1">Take another case where a mendicant focuses on form, but their mind isn’t secure … But when they focus on the formless, their mind becomes secure … Their mind is in a good state … well detached from forms. They’re freed from the distressing and feverish defilements that arise because of form, so they don’t experience that kind of feeling. This is how the escape from forms is explained. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an5.200:5.1">Take a case where a mendicant focuses on identity, but their mind isn’t secure, confident, settled, and decided about it. But when they focus on the ending of identity, their mind is secure, confident, settled, and decided about it. Their mind is in a good state, well developed, well risen, well freed, and well detached from identity. They’re freed from the distressing and feverish defilements that arise because of identity, so they don’t experience that kind of feeling. This is how the escape from identity is explained. </p>
<p id="an5.200:6.1">Delight in sensual pleasures, ill will, harming, form, and identity don’t linger within them. That’s why they’re called a mendicant who is without underlying tendencies, who has cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of suffering. These are the five elements of escape.” </p>

<p id="an6.1:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>
<p id="an6.1:1.5">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="an6.1:2.1">“Mendicants, a mendicant with six qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world. What six? </p>
<p id="an6.1:2.3">It’s a mendicant who, when they see a sight with their eyes, is neither happy nor sad. They remain equanimous, mindful and aware. </p>
<p id="an6.1:2.4">When they hear a sound with their ears … </p>
<p id="an6.1:2.5">When they smell an odor with their nose … </p>
<p id="an6.1:2.6">When they taste a flavor with their tongue … </p>
<p id="an6.1:2.7">When they feel a touch with their body … </p>
<p id="an6.1:2.8">When they know a thought with their mind, they’re neither happy nor sad. They remain equanimous, mindful and aware. </p>
<p id="an6.1:2.9">A mendicant with these six qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.” </p>
<p id="an6.1:3.1">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants approved what the Buddha said. </p>

<p id="an6.2:1.1">“Mendicants, a mendicant with six qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world. What six? </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an6.2:1.3">It’s a mendicant who wields the many kinds of psychic power: multiplying themselves and becoming one again; appearing and disappearing; going unimpeded through a wall, a rampart, or a mountain as if through space; diving in and out of the earth as if it were water; walking on water as if it were earth; flying cross-legged through the sky like a bird; touching and stroking with the hand the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. They control the body as far as the Brahmā realm. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an6.2:2.1">With clairaudience that is purified and superhuman, they hear both kinds of sounds, human and divine, whether near or far. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an6.2:3.1">They understand the minds of other beings and individuals, having comprehended them with their own mind. They understand mind with greed as ‘mind with greed’, and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed’. They understand mind with hate … mind without hate … mind with delusion … mind without delusion … constricted mind … scattered mind … expansive mind … unexpansive mind … mind that is not supreme … mind that is supreme … mind immersed in samādhi … mind not immersed in samādhi … freed mind … They understand unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind’. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an6.2:4.1">They recollect many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an6.2:5.1">With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an6.2:6.1">They realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. </p>

<p id="an6.10:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an6.10:1.3">“Sir, when a noble disciple has reached the fruit and understood the instructions, what kind of meditation do they frequently practice?” </p>
<p id="an6.10:2.1">“Mahānāma, when a noble disciple has reached the fruit and understood the instructions they frequently practice this kind of meditation. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an6.10:2.2">Firstly, a noble disciple recollects the Realized One: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ When a noble disciple recollects the Realized One their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. At that time their mind is unswerving, based on the Realized One. A noble disciple whose mind is unswerving finds inspiration in the meaning and the teaching, and finds joy connected with the teaching. When they’re joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when they’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and develop the recollection of the Buddha. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an6.10:3.1">Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ When a noble disciple recollects the teaching their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. … This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and develop the recollection of the teaching. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an6.10:4.1">Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ When a noble disciple recollects the Saṅgha their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. … This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and develop the recollection of the Saṅgha. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an6.10:5.1">Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects their own ethical conduct, which is unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. When a noble disciple recollects their ethical conduct their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. … This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and develop the recollection of ethics. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an6.10:6.1">Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects their own generosity: ‘I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate! Among people full of the stain of stinginess I live at home rid of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.’ When a noble disciple recollects their own generosity their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. … This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and develop the recollection of generosity. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an6.10:7.1">Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects the deities: ‘There are the Gods of the Four Great Kings, the Gods of the Thirty-Three, the Gods of Yama, the Joyful Gods, the Gods Who Love to Create, the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others, the Gods of Brahmā’s Host, and gods even higher than these. When those deities passed away from here, they were reborn there because of their faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. I, too, have the same kind of faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.’ When a noble disciple recollects the faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom of both themselves and the deities their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. At that time their mind is unswerving, based on the deities. A noble disciple whose mind is unswerving finds inspiration in the meaning and the teaching, and finds joy connected with the teaching. When you’re joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, you feel bliss. And when you’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and develop the recollection of the deities. </p>

<p data-counter="1" id="an6.13:1.3">Take a mendicant who says: ‘I’ve developed the heart’s release by love. I’ve cultivated it, made it my vehicle and my basis, kept it up, consolidated it, and properly implemented it. Yet somehow ill will still occupies my mind.’ They should be told, ‘Not so, venerable! Don’t say that. Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that. It’s impossible, reverend, it cannot happen that the heart’s release by love has been developed and properly implemented, yet somehow ill will still occupies the mind. For it is the heart’s release by love that is the escape from ill will.’ </p>

<p data-counter="3" id="an6.13:3.1">Take another mendicant who says: ‘I’ve developed the heart’s release by rejoicing. I’ve cultivated it, made it my vehicle and my basis, kept it up, consolidated it, and properly implemented it. Yet somehow discontent still occupies my mind.’ They should be told, ‘Not so, venerable! … For it is the heart’s release by rejoicing that is the escape from discontent.’ </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an6.13:4.1">Take another mendicant who says: ‘I’ve developed the heart’s release by equanimity. I’ve cultivated it, made it my vehicle and my basis, kept it up, consolidated it, and properly implemented it. Yet somehow desire still occupies my mind.’ They should be told, ‘Not so, venerable! … For it is the heart’s release by equanimity that is the escape from desire.’ </p>

I’ve cultivated it, made it my vehicle and my basis, kept it up, consolidated it, and properly implemented it. Yet somehow my consciousness still follows after signs.’ They should be told, ‘Not so, venerable! … For it is the signless release of the heart that is the escape from all signs.’ </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an6.13:6.1">Take another mendicant who says: ‘I’m rid of the conceit “I am”. And I don’t regard anything as “I am this”.

<p id="an6.16:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood. Now at that time the householder Nakula’s father was sick, suffering, gravely ill. Then the housewife Nakula’s mother said to him: </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an6.16:2.1">“Householder, don’t pass away with concerns. Such concern is suffering, and it’s criticized by the Buddha. Householder, you might think: ‘When I’ve gone, the housewife Nakula’s mother won’t be able to provide for the children and keep up the household carpets.’ But you should not see it like this. I’m skilled at spinning cotton and carding wool. I’m able to provide for the children and keep up the household carpets. So householder, don’t pass away with concerns … </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an6.16:3.1">Householder, you might think: ‘When I’ve gone, the housewife Nakula’s mother will take another husband.’ But you should not see it like this. Both you and I know that we have remained celibate while at home for the past sixteen years. So householder, don’t pass away with concerns … </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an6.16:4.1">Householder, you might think: ‘When I’ve gone, the housewife Nakula’s mother won’t want to see the Buddha and his Saṅgha of mendicants.’ But you should not see it like this. When you’ve gone, I’ll want to see the Buddha and his mendicant Saṅgha even more. So householder, don’t pass away with concerns … </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an6.16:5.1">Householder, you might think: ‘The housewife Nakula’s mother won’t fulfill ethics.’ But you should not see it like this. I am one of those white-robed disciples of the Buddha who fulfills their ethics. Whoever doubts this can go and ask the Buddha. He is staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood. So householder, don’t pass away with concerns … </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an6.16:6.1">Householder, you might think: ‘The housewife Nakula’s mother doesn’t have internal serenity of heart.’ But you should not see it like this. I am one of those white-robed disciples of the Buddha who has internal serenity of heart. Whoever doubts this can go and ask the Buddha. He is staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood. So householder, don’t pass away with concerns … </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an6.16:7.1">Householder, you might think: ‘The housewife Nakula’s mother has not gained a basis, a firm basis, and solace in this teaching and training. She has not gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and gained assurance. And she’s not independent of others in the Teacher’s instructions.’ But you should not see it like this. I am one of those white-robed disciples of the Buddha who has gained a basis, a firm basis, and solace in this teaching and training. I have gone beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and gained assurance. And I am independent of others in the Teacher’s instructions. Whoever doubts this can go and ask the Buddha. He is staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood. So householder, don’t pass away with concerns. Such concern is suffering, and it’s criticized by the Buddha.” </p>
<p id="an6.16:8.1">And then, as Nakula’s mother was giving this advice to Nakula’s father, his illness died down on the spot. And that’s how Nakula’s father recovered from that illness. Soon after recovering, leaning on a staff he went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: </p>
<p id="an6.16:9.1">“You’re fortunate, householder, so very fortunate, to have the housewife Nakula’s mother advise and instruct you out of kindness and compassion. </p>
<p id="an6.16:9.3">She is one of those white-robed disciples of the Buddha who fulfills their ethics. </p>

<p id="an6.17:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>
<p id="an6.17:1.2">Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat, went to the assembly hall, and sat down on the seat spread out. Venerable Sāriputta also came out of retreat, went to the assembly hall, bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. Venerables Mahāmoggallāna, Mahākassapa, Mahākaccāna, Mahākoṭṭhita, Mahācunda, Mahākappina, Anuruddha, Revata, and Ānanda did the same. The Buddha spent much of the night sitting in meditation, then got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. And soon after the Buddha left those venerables each went to their own dwelling. </p>
<p id="an6.17:1.15">But those mendicants who were junior, recently gone forth, newly come to this teaching and training slept until the sun came up, snoring. The Buddha saw them doing this, with his clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman. He went to the assembly hall, sat down on the seat spread out, and addressed the mendicants: </p>
<p id="an6.17:2.1">“Mendicants, where is Sāriputta? Where are Mahāmoggallāna, Mahākassapa, Mahākaccāna, Mahākoṭṭhita, Mahācunda, Mahākappina, Anuruddha, Revata, and Ānanda? Where have these senior disciples gone?” </p>
<p id="an6.17:2.12">“Soon after the Buddha left those venerables each went to their own dwelling.” </p>
<p id="an6.17:2.13">“So, mendicants, when the senior mendicants left, why did you sleep until the sun came up, snoring? </p>
<p id="an6.17:2.14">What do you think, mendicants? Have you ever seen or heard of an anointed aristocratic king who rules his whole life, dear and beloved to the country, while indulging in the pleasures of sleeping, lying down, and drowsing as much as he likes?” </p>
<p id="an6.17:2.17">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="an6.17:2.18">“Good, mendicants! I too have never seen or heard of such a thing. </p>
<p id="an6.17:3.1">What do you think, mendicants? Have you ever seen or heard of an appointed official … a hereditary official … a general … a village chief … or a guild head who runs the guild his whole life, dear and beloved to the guild, while indulging in the pleasures of sleeping, lying down, and drowsing as much as he likes?” </p>
<p id="an6.17:3.8">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="an6.17:3.9">“Good, mendicants! I too have never seen or heard of such a thing. </p>
<p id="an6.17:4.1">What do you think, mendicants? Have you ever seen or heard of an ascetic or brahmin who indulges in the pleasures of sleeping, lying down, and drowsing as much as they like? Their sense doors are unguarded, they eat too much, they’re not dedicated to wakefulness, they’re unable to discern skillful qualities, and they don’t pursue the development of the qualities that lead to awakening in the evening and toward dawn. Yet they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.” </p>

<p id="an6.18:1.2">While walking along the road he saw a fish dealer in a certain spot selling fish that he had killed himself.

<p id="an6.25:1.1">“Mendicants, there are these six topics for recollection. What six? </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an6.25:1.3">Firstly, a noble disciple recollects the Realized One: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ When a noble disciple recollects the Realized One their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. At that time their mind is unswerving. They’ve left behind greed; they’re free of it and have risen above it. ‘Greed’ is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulation. Relying on this, some sentient beings are purified in this way. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an6.25:2.1">Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ When a noble disciple recollects the teaching their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. … </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an6.25:3.1">Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper.

<p id="an6.29:2.1">Then Venerable Ānanda said to Venerable Udāyī, “Reverend Udāyī, the teacher is addressing you.” </p>
<p id="an6.29:2.3">“Reverend Ānanda, I hear the Buddha. </p>
<p id="an6.29:2.4">It’s when a mendicant recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. This is a topic for recollection.” </p>
<p id="an6.29:3.1">Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda: “Ānanda, I know that this silly man Udāyī is not committed to the higher mind. Ānanda, how many topics for recollection are there?” </p>
<p id="an6.29:4.1">“Sir, there are five topics for recollection. What five? </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an6.29:4.3">Firstly, a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption. When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to blissful meditation in this very life. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an6.29:5.1">Furthermore, a mendicant focuses on the perception of light, concentrating on the perception of day regardless of whether it’s night or day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance. When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to knowledge and vision. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an6.29:6.1">Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth. ‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’ When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to giving up sensual desire. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an6.29:7.1">Furthermore, suppose a mendicant were to see a corpse thrown in a charnel ground. And it had been dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering. They’d compare it with their own body: ‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’ </p>
<p id="an6.29:8.1">Or suppose they were to see a corpse thrown in a charnel ground being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, dogs, jackals, and many kinds of little creatures. They’d compare it with their own body: ‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’ </p>
<p id="an6.29:9.1">Furthermore, suppose they were to see a corpse thrown in a charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together by sinews … A skeleton without flesh but smeared with blood, and held together by sinews … A skeleton rid of flesh and blood, held together by sinews … Bones rid of sinews scattered in every direction. Here a hand-bone, there a foot-bone, here a shin-bone, there a thigh-bone, here a hip-bone, there a rib-bone, here a back-bone, there an arm-bone, here a neck-bone, there a jaw-bone, here a tooth, there the skull … White bones, the color of shells … Decrepit bones, heaped in a pile … Bones rotted and crumbled to powder. They’d compare it with their own body: ‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’ When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to uprooting the conceit ‘I am’. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an6.29:10.1">Furthermore, a mendicant, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to the penetration of many elements. These are the five topics for recollection.” </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an6.29:11.1">“Good, good, Ānanda. Well then, Ānanda, you should also remember this sixth topic for recollection. In this case, a mendicant goes out mindfully, returns mindfully, stands mindfully, sits mindfully, lies down mindfully, and applies themselves to work mindfully. When this topic of recollection is developed and cultivated in this way it leads to mindfulness and situational awareness.” </p>

<p id="an6.34:1.2">Then as Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, “Which gods know that they are stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening?” </p>
<p id="an6.34:1.5">Now, at that time a monk called Tissa had recently passed away and been reborn in a Brahmā realm. There they knew that Tissa the Brahmā was very mighty and powerful. </p>
<p id="an6.34:2.1">And then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from Jeta’s Grove and reappeared in that Brahmā realm. </p>
<p id="an6.34:2.2">Tissa saw Moggallāna coming off in the distance, and said to him, “Come, my good Moggallāna! Welcome, my good Moggallāna! It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here. Sit, my good Moggallāna, this seat is for you.” Moggallāna sat down on the seat spread out. Then Tissa bowed to Moggallāna and sat to one side. </p>
<p id="an6.34:2.9">Moggallāna said to him, “Tissa, which gods know that they are stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening?” </p>
<p id="an6.34:3.2">“The gods of the Four Great Kings know this.” </p>
<p id="an6.34:4.1">“But do all of them know this?” </p>
<p id="an6.34:4.2">“No, my good Moggallāna, not all of them. Those who lack experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and lack the ethics loved by the noble ones, do not know that they are stream-enterers. But those who have experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and have the ethics loved by the noble ones, do know that they are stream-enterers.” </p>
<p id="an6.34:5.1">“But Tissa, is it only the gods of the Four Great Kings who know that they are stream-enterers, or do the gods of the Thirty-Three … the Gods of Yama … the Joyful Gods … the Gods Who Love to Create … and the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others know that they are stream-enterers, not liable to be reborn in the underworld, bound for awakening?” </p>
<p id="an6.34:5.6">“The gods of these various classes know this.” </p>
<p id="an6.34:6.1">“But do all of them know this?” </p>
<p id="an6.34:6.2">“No, my good Moggallāna, not all of them. Those who lack experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and lack the ethics loved by the noble ones, do not know that they are stream-enterers. But those who have experiential confidence in the Buddha, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and have the ethics loved by the noble ones, do know that they are stream-enterers.” </p>
<p id="an6.34:7.1">Moggallāna approved and agreed with what Tissa the Brahmā said. Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from that Brahmā realm and reappeared in Jeta’s Grove. </p>

Such a mendicant lacks respect and reverence for the Teacher, the teaching, and the Saṅgha, and they don’t fulfill the training.

<p id="an6.37:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>
<p id="an6.37:1.2">Now at that time Veḷukaṇṭakī, Nanda’s mother, was preparing a religious donation with six factors for the mendicant Saṅgha headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna. The Buddha saw her doing this, with his clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, and he addressed the mendicants: </p>
<p id="an6.37:1.5">“This Veḷukaṇṭakī, Nanda’s mother, is preparing a religious donation with six factors for the mendicant Saṅgha headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna. </p>
<p id="an6.37:2.1">And how does a religious donation have six factors? Three factors apply to the donor and three to the recipients. </p>
<p id="an6.37:2.3">What three factors apply to the donor? It’s when a donor is in a good mood before giving, while giving they feel confident, and after giving they’re uplifted. These three factors apply to the donor. </p>
<p id="an6.37:3.1">What three factors apply to the recipients? It’s when the recipients are free of greed, hate, and delusion, or practicing to be free of them. These three factors apply to the recipients. </p>
<p id="an6.37:3.4">Thus three factors apply to the donor and three to the recipients. That’s how a religious donation has six factors. </p>
<p id="an6.37:4.1">It’s not easy to grasp the merit of such a six-factored donation by saying that this is the extent of their overflowing merit, overflowing goodness that nurtures happiness and is conducive to heaven, ripening in happiness and leading to heaven. And it leads to what is likable, desirable, agreeable, to welfare and happiness. It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of merit. </p>
<p id="an6.37:5.1">It’s like trying to grasp how much water is in the ocean. It’s not easy to say how many gallons, how many hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands of gallons there are. It’s simply reckoned as an incalculable, immeasurable, great mass of water. In the same way, it’s not easy to grasp the merit of such a six-factored donation … </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an6.37:6.1">A good mood before giving, <br/>confidence while giving, <br/>feeling uplifted after giving: <br/>this is the perfect sacrifice. </p>

<p id="an6.42:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a village of the Kosalan brahmins named Icchānaṅgala. He stayed in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. The brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala heard: </p>
<p id="an6.42:1.5">“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala. He is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased; and he explains a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.” Then, when the night had passed, they took many fresh and cooked foods and went to the forest near Icchānaṅgala, where they stood outside the gates making a dreadful racket. </p>
<p id="an6.42:2.1">Now, at that time Venerable Nāgita was the Buddha’s attendant. Then the Buddha said to Nāgita, “Nāgita, who’s making that dreadful racket? You’d think it was fishermen hauling in a catch!” </p>
<p id="an6.42:2.4">“Sir, it’s these brahmins and householders of Icchānaṅgala. They’ve brought many fresh and cooked foods, and they’re standing outside the gates wanting to offer it specially to the Buddha and the mendicant Saṅgha.” </p>

<p id="an6.42:3.1">“Sir, may the Blessed One please relent now! May the Holy One relent! Now is the time for the Buddha to relent. Wherever the Buddha now goes, the brahmins and householders will incline the same way, as will the people of town and country. It’s like when it rains heavily and the water flows downhill. In the same way, wherever the Buddha now goes, the brahmins and householders will incline the same way, as will the people of town and country. Why is that? Because of the Buddha’s ethics and wisdom.” </p>

<p id="an6.43:1.5">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. </p>
<p id="an6.43:2.1">So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the Eastern Monastery. In the late afternoon the Buddha came out of retreat and addressed Ānanda, “Come, Ānanda, let’s go to the eastern gate to bathe.” </p>
<p id="an6.43:2.4">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. So the Buddha went with Ānanda to the eastern gate to bathe. When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying himself. </p>
<p id="an6.43:3.1">Now, at that time King Pasenadi had a giant bull elephant called “White”. It emerged from the eastern gate to the beating and playing of musical instruments. </p>
<p id="an6.43:3.2">When people saw it they said, “The royal giant is so handsome! The royal giant is so good-looking! The royal giant is so lovely! The royal giant has such a huge body!” </p>
<p id="an6.43:3.4">When they said this, Venerable Udāyī said to the Buddha, “Sir, is it only when they see elephants with such a huge, formidable body that people say: ‘A giant, such a giant’? Or do they say it when they see any other creatures with huge, formidable bodies?” </p>
<p id="an6.43:3.7">“Udāyī, when they see elephants with such a huge, formidable body people say: ‘A giant, such a giant!’ </p>

<p id="an6.43:4.1">“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing!

<p id="an6.43:7.1">He has transcended all fetters <br/>and escaped from entanglements. <br/>Delighting to renounce sensual pleasures, <br/>he’s freed like gold from stone. </p>
<p id="an6.43:8.1">That giant outshines all, <br/>like the Himalaya beside other mountains. <br/>Of all those named ‘giant’, <br/>he is truly named, supreme. </p>
<p id="an6.43:9.1">I shall extol the giant for you, <br/>for he does nothing monstrous. <br/>Gentleness and harmlessness <br/>are two feet of the giant. </p>
<p id="an6.43:10.1">Fervor and celibacy <br/>are his two other feet. <br/>Faith is the giant’s trunk, <br/>and equanimity his white tusks. </p>
<p id="an6.43:11.1">Mindfulness is his neck, his head is wisdom—<br/>inquiry and thinking about principles. <br/>His belly is the sacred hearth of the Dhamma, <br/>and his tail is seclusion. </p>
<p id="an6.43:12.1">Practicing absorption, enjoying the breath, <br/>he is serene within. <br/>The giant is serene when walking, <br/>the giant is serene when standing, </p>
<p id="an6.43:13.1">the giant is serene when lying down, <br/>and when sitting, the giant is serene. <br/>The giant is restrained everywhere: <br/>this is the accomplishment of the giant. </p>
<p id="an6.43:14.1">He eats blameless things, <br/>he doesn’t eat blameworthy things. <br/>When he gets food and clothes, <br/>he avoids storing them up. </p>
<p id="an6.43:15.1">Having severed all bonds, <br/>fetters large and small, <br/>wherever he goes, <br/>he goes without concern. </p>
<p id="an6.43:16.1">A white lotus, <br/>fragrant and delightful, <br/>sprouts in water and grows there, <br/>but water does not stick to it. </p>
<p id="an6.43:17.1">Just so the Buddha is born in the world, <br/>and lives in the world, <br/>but the world does not stick to him, <br/>as water does not stick to the lotus. </p>
<p id="an6.43:18.1">A great blazing fire <br/>dies down when the fuel runs out. <br/>When the coals have gone out <br/>it’s said to be ‘extinguished’. </p>
<p id="an6.43:19.1">This simile is taught by the discerning <br/>to express the meaning clearly. <br/>Great giants will understand <br/>what the giant taught the giant. </p>
<p id="an6.43:20.1">Free of greed, free of hate, <br/>free of delusion, undefiled; <br/>the giant, giving up his body, <br/>being undefiled, will be fully extinguished.” </p>

<p id="an6.44:1.1">Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the laywoman Migasālā, where he sat on the seat spread out. </p>
<p id="an6.44:1.2">Then the laywoman Migasālā went up to Ānanda, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Honorable Ānanda, how on earth are we supposed to understand the teaching taught by the Buddha, when the chaste and the unchaste are both reborn in exactly the same place in the next life? </p>
<p id="an6.44:2.2">My father Purāṇa was celibate, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex. When he passed away the Buddha declared that, since he was a once-returner, he was reborn in the host of Joyful Gods. </p>
<p id="an6.44:2.4">But my uncle Isidatta was not celibate; he lived content with his wife. When he passed away the Buddha declared that, since he was also a once-returner, he was reborn in the host of Joyful Gods. </p>
<p id="an6.44:2.6">How on earth are we supposed to understand the teaching taught by the Buddha, when the chaste and the unchaste are both reborn in exactly the same place in the next life?” </p>
<p id="an6.44:2.7">“You’re right, sister, but that’s how the Buddha declared it.” </p>
<p id="an6.44:3.1">Then Ānanda, after receiving almsfood at Migasālā’s home, rose from his seat and left. Then after the meal, on his return from almsround, Ānanda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. </p>
<p id="an6.44:5.1">“Ānanda, who is this laywoman Migasālā, a foolish incompetent aunty, with an aunty’s wit? And who is it that knows how to assess individuals? These six people are found in the world. What six? </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an6.44:6.2">Take a certain person who is sweet-natured and pleasant to be with. And spiritual companions enjoy living together with them. And they’ve not listened or learned or comprehended theoretically or found even temporary freedom. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re headed for a lower place, not a higher. They’re going to a lower place, not a higher. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an6.44:7.1">Take another person who is sweet-natured and pleasant to be with. And spiritual companions enjoy living together with them.

They’re going to a higher place, not a lower. </p>
<p id="an6.44:8.1">Judgmental people compare them, saying: ‘This one has just the same qualities as the other, so why is one worse and one better?’ This will be for their lasting harm and suffering. </p>
<p id="an6.44:9.1">In this case, the person who is sweet-natured … and has listened, learned, comprehended theoretically, and found temporary freedom is better and finer than the other person. Why is that? Because the stream of the teaching carries them along. But who knows the difference between them except a Realized One? </p>
<p id="an6.44:9.6">So, Ānanda, don’t be judgmental about people. Don’t pass judgment on people. Those who pass judgment on people harm themselves. I, or someone like me, may pass judgment on people. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an6.44:10.1">Take another person who is angry and conceited, and from time to time has greedy thoughts.

And they’ve not listened or learned or comprehended theoretically or found even temporary freedom. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re headed for a lower place, not a higher.

<p id="an6.44:18.1">If Isidatta had achieved Purāṇa’s level of ethical conduct, Purāṇa could not have even known Isidatta’s destination. And if Purāṇa had achieved Isidatta’s level of wisdom, Isidatta could not have even known Purāṇa’s destination. So both individuals were lacking in one respect.” </p>

<p data-counter="1" id="an6.45:1.2">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an6.45:2.1">“When a poor, penniless person falls into debt, isn’t being in debt also suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?” </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an6.45:2.2">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an6.45:3.1">“When a poor person who has fallen into debt agrees to pay interest, isn’t the interest also suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?” </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an6.45:3.2">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an6.45:4.1">“When a poor person who has fallen into debt and agreed to pay interest fails to pay it when it falls due, they get a warning. Isn’t being warned suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?” </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an6.45:4.3">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an6.45:5.1">“When a poor person fails to pay after getting a warning, they’re prosecuted. Isn’t being prosecuted suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?” </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an6.45:5.3">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an6.45:6.1">“When a poor person fails to pay after being prosecuted, they’re imprisoned. Isn’t being imprisoned suffering in the world for a person who enjoys sensual pleasures?” </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an6.45:6.3">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an6.45:7.1">“So mendicants, poverty, debt, interest, warnings, prosecution, and imprisonment are suffering in the world for those who enjoy sensual pleasures. In the same way, whoever has no faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom when it comes to skillful qualities is called poor and penniless in the training of the Noble One. </p>
<p id="an6.45:8.1">Since they have no faith, conscience, prudence, energy, or wisdom when it comes to skillful qualities, they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. This is how they’re in debt, I say. </p>
<p id="an6.45:9.1">In order to conceal the bad things they do by way of body, speech, and mind they harbour corrupt wishes. They wish, plan, speak, and act with the thought: ‘May no-one find me out!’ This is how they pay interest, I say. </p>
<p id="an6.45:10.1">Good-hearted spiritual companions say this about them: ‘This venerable acts like this, and behaves like that.’ This is how they’re warned, I say. </p>
<p id="an6.45:11.1">When they go to a wilderness, the root of a tree, or an empty hut, they’re beset by remorseful, unskillful thoughts. This is how they’re prosecuted, I say. </p>
<p id="an6.45:12.1">That poor, penniless person has done bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re trapped in the prison of hell or the animal realm. I don’t see a single prison that’s as brutal, as vicious, and such an obstacle to reaching the supreme sanctuary from the yoke as the prison of hell or the animal realm. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an6.45:13.1">Poverty is said to be suffering in the world, <br/>and so is being in debt. <br/>A poor person who has fallen into debt <br/>frets even when spending the loan. </p>
<p id="an6.45:14.1">And then they’re prosecuted, <br/>or even thrown in jail. <br/>Such imprisonment is true suffering <br/>for someone who prays for pleasure and possessions. </p>
<p id="an6.45:15.1">In the same way, in the noble one’s training <br/>whoever has no faith, <br/>no conscience or prudence, <br/>contemplates bad deeds. </p>
<p id="an6.45:16.1">After doing bad things <br/>by way of body, <br/>speech, and mind, <br/>they wish, ‘May no-one find me out!’ </p>
<p id="an6.45:17.1">Their behavior is creepy <br/>by body, speech, and mind. <br/>They pile up bad deeds <br/>on and on, life after life. </p>
<p id="an6.45:18.1">That stupid evildoer, <br/>knowing their own misdeeds, <br/>is a poor person who has fallen into debt, <br/>and frets even when spending the loan. </p>
<p id="an6.45:19.1">And when in village or wilderness <br/>they’re prosecuted <br/>by painful mental plans, <br/>which are born of remorse. </p>
<p id="an6.45:20.1">That stupid evildoer, <br/>knowing their own misdeeds, <br/>goes to one of the animal realms, <br/>or is trapped in hell. </p>

<p id="an6.45:23.1">In the same way, in the noble one’s training, <br/>whoever is grounded in faith, <br/>with conscience and prudence, <br/>wise, and ethically restrained, </p>
<p id="an6.45:24.1">is said to live happily <br/>in the noble one’s training. <br/>After gaining pleasure not of the flesh, <br/>they concentrate on equanimity. </p>
<p id="an6.45:25.1">They give up the five hindrances, <br/>constantly energetic, <br/>and enter the absorptions, <br/>unified, alert, and mindful. </p>
<p id="an6.45:26.1">Truly knowing in this way <br/>the end of all fetters, <br/>by not grasping in any way, <br/>their mind is rightly freed. </p>
<p id="an6.45:27.1">To that poised one, rightly freed <br/>with the end of the fetters of rebirth, <br/>the knowledge comes: <br/>‘My freedom is unshakable.’ </p>
<p id="an6.45:28.1">This is the ultimate knowledge. <br/>This is the supreme happiness. <br/>Sorrowless, stainless, secure: <br/>this is the highest freedom from debt.” </p>

<p id="an6.46:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time Venerable Mahācunda was staying in the land of the Cetis at Sahajāti. There he addressed the mendicants: “Reverends, mendicants!” </p>
<p id="an6.46:1.5">“Reverend,” they replied. Venerable Mahācunda said this: </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an6.46:2.1">“Take a case where mendicants who practice discernment of principles rebuke mendicants who practice absorption meditation: ‘They say, “We practice absorption meditation! We practice absorption meditation!” And they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate. Why do they practice absorption meditation? In what way do they practice absorption meditation? How do they practice absorption meditation?’ In this case the mendicants who practice discernment of principles are not inspired, and the mendicants who practice absorption meditation are not inspired. And they’re not acting for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an6.46:3.1">Now, take a case where mendicants who practice absorption meditation rebuke mendicants who practice discernment of principles: ‘They say, “We practice discernment of principles! We practice discernment of principles!” But they’re restless, insolent, fickle, scurrilous, loose-tongued, unmindful, lacking situational awareness and immersion, with straying minds and undisciplined faculties. Why do they practice discernment of principles? In what way do they practice discernment of principles? How do they practice discernment of principles?’ In this case the mendicants who practice absorption meditation are not inspired, and the mendicants who practice discernment of principles are not inspired. And they’re not acting for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an6.46:4.1">Now, take a case where mendicants who practice discernment of principles praise only others like them, not mendicants who practice absorption meditation.

<p data-counter="5" id="an6.46:6.1">So you should train like this: ‘As mendicants who practice discernment of principles, we will praise mendicants who practice absorption meditation.’ That’s how you should train.

<p id="an6.52:1.1">And then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: </p>

<p id="an6.54:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. </p>
<p id="an6.54:1.2">Now at that time Venerable Dhammika was a resident in all seven monasteries of his native land. There he abused visiting mendicants; he insulted, harmed, attacked, and harassed them. The visiting mendicants who were treated in this way did not stay. They left, abandoning the monastery. </p>
<p id="an6.54:2.1">Then the local lay followers thought to themselves, “We have supplied the mendicant Saṅgha with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. But the visiting mendicants don’t stay. They leave, abandoning the monastery. What is the cause, what is the reason for this?” </p>
<p id="an6.54:2.5">Then the local lay followers thought to themselves, “This Venerable Dhammika abuses visiting mendicants; he insults, harms, attacks, and harasses them. The visiting mendicants who were treated in this way do not stay. They leave, abandoning the monastery. Why don’t we banish Venerable Dhammika?” </p>
<p id="an6.54:3.1">Then the local lay followers went up to Venerable Dhammika and said to him, “Sir, please leave this monastery. You’ve stayed here long enough.” </p>
<p id="an6.54:3.4">Then Venerable Dhammika left and went to another monastery. There he abused visiting mendicants; he insulted, harmed, attacked, and harassed them. The visiting mendicants who were treated in this way did not stay. They left, abandoning the monastery. </p>
<p id="an6.54:4.1">Then the local lay followers thought to themselves: … </p>
<p id="an6.54:5.1">They said to Venerable Dhammika, “Sir, please leave this monastery. You’ve stayed here long enough.” </p>
<p id="an6.54:5.4">Then Venerable Dhammika left and went to another monastery. There he abused visiting mendicants; he insulted, harmed, attacked, and harassed them. The visiting mendicants who were treated in this way did not stay. They left, abandoning the monastery. </p>
<p id="an6.54:6.1">Then the local lay followers thought to themselves, “Why don’t we banish Venerable Dhammika from all seven monasteries in our native land?” </p>
<p id="an6.54:6.7">Then the local lay followers went up to Venerable Dhammika and said to him, “Sir, please leave all seven monasteries in our native land.” </p>
<p id="an6.54:6.9">Then Venerable Dhammika thought, “I’ve been banished by the local lay followers from all seven monasteries in my native land. Where am I to go now?” He thought, “Why don’t I go to see the Buddha?” </p>
<p id="an6.54:7.1">Then Venerable Dhammika took his bowl and robe and set out for Rājagaha. Eventually he came to Rājagaha and the Vulture’s Peak. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, “So, Brahmin Dhammika, where have you come from?” </p>
<p id="an6.54:7.4">“Sir, I’ve been banished by the local lay followers from all seven monasteries in my native land.” </p>
<p id="an6.54:7.5">“Enough, Brahmin Dhammika, what’s that to you? Now that you’ve been banished from all of those places, you have come to me. </p>
<p id="an6.54:8.1">Once upon a time, some sea-merchants set sail for the ocean deeps, taking with them a land-spotting bird. When their ship was out of sight of land, they released the bird. It flew right away to the east, the west, the north, the south, upwards, and in-between. If it saw land on any side, it went there and stayed. But if it saw no land on any side it returned to the ship. In the same way, now that you’ve been banished from all of those places, you have come to me. </p>
<p id="an6.54:9.1">Once upon a time, King Koravya had a royal banyan tree with five trunks called ‘Well Planted’. It was shady and lovely. Its canopy spread over twelve leagues, while the network of roots spread for five leagues. Its fruits were as large as a rice pot. And they were as sweet as pure wild honey. The king and harem made use of one trunk, the troops another, the people of town and country another, ascetics and brahmins another, and beasts and birds another. No-one guarded the fruit, yet no-one damaged another’s fruits. </p>
<p id="an6.54:10.1">Then a certain person ate as much as he liked of the fruit, then broke off a branch and left. Then the deity haunting the royal banyan tree thought, ‘Oh, how incredible, how amazing! How wicked this person is, to eat as much as they like, then break off a branch and leave! Why don’t I make sure that the royal banyan tree gives no fruit in future?’ Then the royal banyan tree gave no more fruit. </p>
<p id="an6.54:11.1">Then King Koravya went up to Sakka, lord of gods, and said to him, ‘Please sir, you should know that the royal banyan tree called Well Planted gives no fruit.’ Then Sakka used his psychic powers to will that a violent storm come. And it felled and uprooted the royal banyan tree. Then the deity haunting the tree stood to one side, miserable and sad, weeping, with a tearful face. </p>
<p id="an6.54:12.1">Then Sakka went up to that deity, and said, ‘Why, god, are you standing to one side, miserable and sad, weeping, with a tearful face?’ </p>
<p id="an6.54:12.3">‘Because, my good sir, a violent storm came and felled and uprooted my home.’ </p>
<p id="an6.54:12.4">‘Well, did you stand by your tree’s duty when the storm came?’ </p>
<p id="an6.54:12.5">‘But my good sir, how does a tree stand by its duty?’ </p>
<p id="an6.54:12.6">‘It’s when those who need the tree’s roots, bark, leaves, flowers, or fruit take what they need. Yet the deity is not displeased or upset because of this. This is how a tree stands by its duty.’ </p>
<p id="an6.54:12.9">‘I was not standing by a tree’s duty when the storm came and felled and uprooted my home.’ </p>
<p id="an6.54:12.10">‘God, if you were to stand by a tree’s duty, your home may be as it was before.’ </p>
<p id="an6.54:12.11">‘I will stand by a tree’s duty! May my home be as it was before!’ </p>
<p id="an6.54:13.1">Then Sakka used his psychic power to will that a violent storm come. And it raised up that mighty banyan tree and the bark of the roots was healed. </p>
<p id="an6.54:13.2">In the same way, Brahmin Dhammika, were you standing by an ascetic’s duty when the local lay followers banished you from all seven of the monasteries in your native land?” </p>
<p id="an6.54:13.3">“But sir, how do I stand by an ascetic’s duty?” </p>
<p id="an6.54:13.4">“When someone abuses, annoys, or argues with an ascetic, the ascetic doesn’t abuse, annoy, or argue back at them. That’s how an ascetic stands by an ascetic’s duty.” </p>
<p id="an6.54:13.6">“I was not standing by an ascetic’s duty when the local lay followers banished me from all seven of the monasteries in my native land.” </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an6.54:13.7">“Once upon a time, there was a Teacher called Sunetta. He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire. He had many hundreds of disciples. He taught them the path to rebirth in the company of Brahmā. Those lacking confidence in Sunetta were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. Those full of confidence in Sunetta were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. </p>
<p data-counter="2–6" id="an6.54:14.1">Once upon a time there was a teacher called Mūgapakkha … Aranemi … Kuddālaka … Hatthipāla … Jotipāla. He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire. He had many hundreds of disciples. He taught them the way to rebirth in the company of Brahmā. Those lacking confidence in Jotipāla were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. Those full of confidence in Jotipāla were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. </p>
<p id="an6.54:19.1">What do you think, Brahmin Dhammika? If someone with malicious intent were to abuse and insult these six teachers with their hundreds of followers, would they not make much bad karma?” </p>
<p id="an6.54:19.3">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an6.54:19.4">“They would indeed. But someone who abuses and insults a single person accomplished in view with malicious intent makes even more bad karma. Why is that? Brahmin Dhammika, I say that any injury done by those outside of the Buddhist community does not compare with what is done to one’s own spiritual companions. So you should train like this: ‘We will have no malicious intent for those who we want to have as our spiritual companions.’ That is how you should train. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an6.54:20.1">Sunetta and Mūgapakkha, <br/>and Aranemi the brahmin, <br/>Hatthipāla the student, <br/>and Kuddālaka were Teachers. </p>
<p id="an6.54:21.1">And Jotipāla Govinda <br/>was priest for seven kings. <br/>These six famous teachers, <br/>harmless ones of the past, </p>
<p id="an6.54:22.1">were free of putrefaction, compassionate, <br/>gone beyond the fetter of sensuality. <br/>Detached from sensual desire, <br/>they were reborn in the Brahmā realm. </p>

<p id="an6.54:25.1">But one who insults <br/>with malicious intent <br/>a single person accomplished in view, <br/>a mendicant disciple of the Buddha; <br/>that man <br/>makes even more bad karma. </p>
<p id="an6.54:26.1">You shouldn’t attack a holy person, <br/>who has given up the grounds for views. <br/>This person is called <br/>the seventh of the noble Saṅgha. </p>
<p id="an6.54:27.1">They’re not free of desire for sensual pleasures, <br/>and their faculties are still immature: <br/>faith, mindfulness, and energy, <br/>serenity and discernment. </p>
<p id="an6.54:28.1">If you attack such a mendicant, <br/>you first hurt yourself. <br/>Having hurt yourself, <br/>you harm the other. </p>
<p id="an6.54:29.1">But if you protect yourself, <br/>the other is also protected. <br/>So you should protect yourself. <br/>An astute person is always uninjured.” </p>

<p id="an6.55:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. </p>
<p id="an6.55:1.3">Now at that time Venerable Soṇa was staying near Rājagaha in the Cool Grove. Then as he was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, “I am one of the Buddha’s most energetic disciples. Yet my mind is not freed from defilements by not grasping. But my family has wealth. I could enjoy that wealth and make merit. Why don’t I resign the training and return to a lesser life, so I can enjoy my wealth and make merit?” </p>
<p id="an6.55:2.1">Then the Buddha knew what Venerable Soṇa was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Vulture’s Peak and reappeared in the Cool Grove in front of Soṇa, and sat on the seat spread out. Soṇa bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. </p>
<p id="an6.55:2.4">The Buddha said to him, “Soṇa, as you were in private retreat didn’t this thought come to your mind: ‘I am one of the Buddha’s most energetic disciples. Yet my mind is not freed from defilements by not grasping. But my family has wealth. I could enjoy that wealth and make merit. Why don’t I resign the training and return to a lesser life, so I can enjoy my wealth and make merit?’” </p>
<p id="an6.55:3.5">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an6.55:4.1">“What do you think, Soṇa? When you were still a layman, weren’t you a good player of the arched harp?” </p>
<p id="an6.55:4.3">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an6.55:4.4">“When your harp’s strings were tuned too tight, was it resonant and playable?” </p>
<p id="an6.55:4.5">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="an6.55:5.1">“When your harp’s strings were tuned too slack, was it resonant and playable?” </p>
<p id="an6.55:5.2">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="an6.55:6.1">“But when your harp’s strings were tuned neither too tight nor too slack, but fixed at an even tension, was it resonant and playable?” </p>
<p id="an6.55:6.2">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an6.55:7.1">“In the same way, Soṇa, when energy is too forceful it leads to restlessness. When energy is too slack it leads to laziness. So, Soṇa, you should apply yourself to energy and serenity, find a balance of the faculties, and learn the pattern of this situation.” </p>
<p id="an6.55:7.3">“Yes, sir,” Soṇa replied. </p>
<p id="an6.55:7.4">After advising Soṇa like this, the Buddha, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Cool Grove and reappeared on the Vulture’s Peak. </p>
<p id="an6.55:8.1">After some time Soṇa applied himself to energy and serenity, found a balance of the faculties, and learned the pattern of this situation. Then Soṇa, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="an6.55:8.3">He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable Soṇa became one of the perfected. </p>
<p id="an6.55:9.1">Then, when Soṇa had attained perfection, he thought, “Why don’t I go to the Buddha and declare my enlightenment in his presence?” Then Soṇa went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an6.55:10.1">“Sir, a mendicant who is perfected—with defilements ended, who has completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own true goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and is rightly freed through enlightenment—is dedicated to six things. They are dedicated to renunciation, seclusion, kindness, the ending of craving, the ending of grasping, and mental clarity. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an6.55:11.1">It may be, sir, that one of the venerables here thinks: ‘Maybe this venerable is dedicated to renunciation solely out of mere faith.’ But it should not be seen like this. A mendicant with defilements ended does not see in themselves anything more to do, or anything that needs improvement. They’re dedicated to renunciation because they’re free of greed, hate, and delusion with the end of greed, hate, and delusion. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an6.55:12.1">It may be, sir, that one of the venerables here thinks: ‘Maybe this venerable is dedicated to seclusion because they enjoy possessions, honor, and popularity.’ But it should not be seen like this. … </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an6.55:13.1">It may be, sir, that one of the venerables here thinks: ‘Maybe this venerable is dedicated to kindness because they believe that adhering to precepts and observances is the most important thing.’ But it should not be seen like this. … </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an6.55:14.1">They’re dedicated to the ending of craving because they’re free of greed, hate, and delusion with the end of greed, hate, and delusion. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an6.55:15.1">They’re dedicated to the ending of grasping because they’re free of greed, hate, and delusion with the end of greed, hate, and delusion. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an6.55:16.1">They’re dedicated to clarity of mind because they’re free of greed, hate, and delusion with the end of greed, hate, and delusion. </p>
<p id="an6.55:17.1">When a mendicant’s mind is rightly freed like this, even if compelling sights come into the range of vision they don’t overcome their mind. The mind remains unaffected. It is steady, imperturbable, observing disappearance. Even if compelling sounds … smells … tastes … touches … and thoughts come into the range of the mind they don’t overcome the mind. The mind remains unaffected. It is steady, imperturbable, observing disappearance. </p>
<p id="an6.55:17.9">Suppose there was a mountain that was one solid mass of rock, without cracks or holes. Even if violent storms were to blow up out of the east, the west, the north, and the south, they couldn’t make it shake or rock or tremble. </p>
<p id="an6.55:17.13">In the same way, when a mendicant’s mind is rightly freed like this, even if compelling sights come into the range of vision they don’t overcome their mind. … The mind remains unaffected. It is steady, imperturbable, observing disappearance. </p>

<p id="an6.56:1.1">Now at that time Venerable Phagguna was sick, suffering, gravely ill. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an6.56:1.3">“Sir, Venerable Phagguna is sick. Sir, please go to Venerable Phagguna out of compassion.” The Buddha consented with silence. </p>
<p id="an6.56:1.6">Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to Venerable Phagguna. Venerable Phagguna saw the Buddha coming off in the distance and tried to rise on his cot. </p>
<p id="an6.56:1.9">The Buddha said to him, “It’s all right, Phagguna, don’t get up. There are some seats spread out by others, I will sit there.” </p>
<p id="an6.56:1.12">He sat on the seat spread out and said to Venerable Phagguna: “I hope you’re keeping well, Phagguna; I hope you’re alright. And I hope the pain is fading, not growing, that its fading is evident, not its growing.” </p>
<p id="an6.56:2.2">“Sir, I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading. </p>
<p id="an6.56:3.1">The winds piercing my head are so severe, it feels like a strong man drilling into my head with a sharp point. I’m not keeping well. </p>
<p id="an6.56:4.1">The pain in my head is so severe, it feels like a strong man tightening a tough leather strap around my head. I’m not keeping well. </p>
<p id="an6.56:5.1">The winds slicing my belly are so severe, like a deft butcher or their apprentice were slicing open a cows’s belly with a meat cleaver. I’m not keeping well. </p>
<p id="an6.56:6.1">The burning in my body is so severe, it feels like two strong men grabbing a weaker man by the arms to burn and scorch him on a pit of glowing coals. I’m not keeping well, I’m not alright. The pain is terrible and growing, not fading; its growing is evident, not its fading.” </p>
<p id="an6.56:6.3">Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Venerable Phagguna with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. </p>
<p id="an6.56:7.1">Not long after the Buddha left, Venerable Phagguna passed away. At the time of his death, his faculties were bright and clear. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Phagguna died. At the time of his death, his faculties were bright and clear.” </p>
<p id="an6.56:8.1">“And why shouldn’t his faculties be bright and clear? The mendicant Phagguna’s mind was not freed from the five lower fetters. But when he heard that teaching his mind was freed from them. </p>

<p data-counter="1" id="an6.56:9.3">Firstly, take the case of a mendicant whose mind is not freed from the five lower fetters. At the time of death they get to see the Realized One. The Realized One teaches them Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. When they hear that teaching their mind is freed from the five lower fetters. This is the first benefit of listening to the teaching. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an6.56:10.1">Next, take the case of another mendicant whose mind is not freed from the five lower fetters. At the time of death they don’t get to see the Realized One, but they get to see a Realized One’s disciple. The Realized One’s disciple teaches them Dhamma … When they hear that teaching their mind is freed from the five lower fetters. This is the second benefit of listening to the teaching. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an6.56:11.1">Next, take the case of another mendicant whose mind is not freed from the five lower fetters. At the time of death they don’t get to see the Realized One, or to see a Realized One’s disciple. But they think about and consider the teaching in their heart, examining it with the mind as they learned and memorized it. As they do so their mind is freed from the five lower fetters. This is the third benefit of listening to the teaching. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an6.56:12.1">Next, take the case of a mendicant whose mind is freed from the five lower fetters, but not with the supreme ending of attachments. At the time of death they get to see the Realized One. The Realized One teaches them Dhamma … When they hear that teaching their mind is freed with the supreme ending of attachments. This is the fourth benefit of listening to the teaching. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an6.56:13.1">Next, take the case of another mendicant whose mind is freed from the five lower fetters, but not with the supreme ending of attachments.

<p id="an6.57:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an6.57:1.3">“Sir, Pūraṇa Kassapa describes six classes of rebirth: black, blue, red, yellow, white, and ultimate white. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an6.57:2.1">The black class of rebirth consists of slaughterers of sheep, pigs, poultry, or deer, hunters or fishers, bandits, executioners, butchers of cattle, jailers, and any others with a cruel livelihood. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an6.57:3.1">The blue class of rebirth consists of mendicants who live on thorns, and any others who teach the efficacy of deeds and action. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an6.57:4.1">The red class of rebirth consists of the Jain ascetics who wear one cloth. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an6.57:5.1">The yellow class of rebirth consists of the lay people dressed in white who are disciples of the naked ascetics. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an6.57:6.1">The white class of rebirth consists of male and female Ājīvaka ascetics. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an6.57:7.1">And the ultimate white class of rebirth consists of Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Saṅkicca, and the bamboo-staffed ascetic Gosāla. </p>
<p id="an6.57:8.1">These are the six classes of rebirth that Pūraṇa Kassapa describes.” </p>
<p id="an6.57:9.1">“But Ānanda, did the whole world authorize Pūraṇa Kassapa to describe these six classes of rebirth?” </p>
<p id="an6.57:9.2">“No, sir.” </p>
<p id="an6.57:9.3">“It’s as if they were to force a steak on a poor, penniless person, telling them they must eat it and then pay for it. In the same way, Pūraṇa Kassapa has described these six classes of rebirth without the consent of those ascetics and brahmins. And he has done so in a foolish, incompetent, unskilled way, lacking common sense. </p>
<p id="an6.57:10.1">I, however, also describe six classes of rebirth. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="an6.57:10.3">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="an6.57:10.5">“And what, Ānanda, are the six classes of rebirth? Someone born into a dark class gives rise to a dark result. Someone born into a dark class gives rise to a bright result. Someone born into a dark class gives rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright. Someone born into a bright class gives rise to a dark result. Someone born into a bright class gives rise to a bright result. Someone born into a bright class gives rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an6.57:11.1">And how does someone born into a dark class give rise to a dark result? It’s when someone is reborn in a low family—a family of outcastes, bamboo-workers, hunters, chariot-makers, or waste-collectors—poor, with little to eat or drink, where life is tough, and food and shelter are hard to find. And they’re ugly, unsightly, deformed, sickly—one-eyed, crippled, lame, or half-paralyzed. They don’t get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; or bed, house, and lighting. And they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. That’s how someone born into a dark class gives rise to a dark result. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an6.57:12.1">And how does someone born into a dark class give rise to a bright result? It’s when some person is reborn in a low family … But they do good things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. That’s how someone born into a dark class gives rise to a bright result. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an6.57:13.1">And how does someone born into a dark class give rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright? It’s when some person is reborn in a low family … They shave off their hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. They give up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. They firmly establish their mind in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. They truly develop the seven awakening factors. And then they give rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright. That’s how someone born in a dark class gives rise to extinguishment, which is neither dark nor bright. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an6.57:14.1">And how does someone born into a bright class give rise to a dark result? It’s when some person is reborn in an eminent family—a well-to-do family of aristocrats, brahmins, or householders—rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, and lots of money and grain. And they’re attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty. They get to have food, drink, clothes, and vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. But they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. That’s how someone born into a bright class gives rise to a dark result. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an6.57:15.1">And how does someone born into a bright class give rise to a bright result?

<p id="an6.58:1.1">“Mendicants, a mendicant with six qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world. What six? </p>
<p id="an6.58:2.2">It’s a mendicant who, by restraint, has given up the defilements that should be given up by restraint. By using, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by using. By enduring, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by enduring. By avoiding, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by avoiding. By getting rid, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by getting rid. By developing, they’ve given up the defilements that should be given up by developing. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an6.58:3.1">And what are the defilements that should be given up by restraint? Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, lives restraining the eye faculty. For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without restraint of the eye faculty do not arise when there is such restraint. Reflecting rationally, they live restraining the ear faculty … the nose faculty … the tongue faculty … the body faculty … the mind faculty. For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without restraint of the mind faculty do not arise when there is such restraint. These are called the defilements that should be given up by restraint. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an6.58:4.1">And what are the defilements that should be given up by using? Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, makes use of robes: ‘Only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; and for covering up the private parts.’ Reflecting rationally, they make use of almsfood: ‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’ Reflecting rationally, they make use of lodgings: ‘Only for the sake of warding off cold and heat; for warding off the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; to shelter from harsh weather and to enjoy retreat.’ Reflecting rationally, they make use of medicines and supplies for the sick: ‘Only for the sake of warding off the pains of illness and to promote good health.’ For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without using these things do not arise when they are used. These are called the defilements that should be given up by using. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an6.58:5.1">And what are the defilements that should be given up by enduring? Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, endures cold, heat, hunger, and thirst. They endure the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. They endure rude and unwelcome criticism. And they put up with physical pain—sharp, severe, acute, unpleasant, disagreeable, and life-threatening. For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without enduring these things do not arise when they are endured. These are called the defilements that should be given up by enduring. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an6.58:6.1">And what are the defilements that should be given up by avoiding? Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, avoids a wild elephant, a wild horse, a wild ox, a wild dog, a snake, a stump, thorny ground, a pit, a cliff, a swamp, and a sewer. Reflecting rationally, they avoid sitting on inappropriate seats, walking in inappropriate neighborhoods, and mixing with bad friends—whatever sensible spiritual companions would believe to be a bad setting. For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without avoiding these things do not arise when they are avoided. These are called the defilements that should be given up by avoiding. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an6.58:7.1">And what are the defilements that should be given up by getting rid? Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, doesn’t tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen. They don’t tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them. For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without getting rid of these things do not arise when they are gotten rid of. These are called the defilements that should be given up by getting rid. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an6.58:8.1">And what are the defilements that should be given up by developing? Take a mendicant who, reflecting rationally, develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. For the distressing and feverish defilements that might arise in someone who lives without developing these things do not arise when they are developed. These are called the defilements that should be given up by developing. </p>

<p id="an6.59:2.1">“Householder, as a layman enjoying sensual pleasures, living at home with your children, using sandalwood imported from Kāsi, wearing garlands, fragrance, and makeup, and accepting gold and money, it’s hard for you to know who is perfected or on the path to perfection. </p>

<p id="an6.60:1.3">Now at that time several senior mendicants, after the meal, on their return from almsround, sat together in the pavilion talking about the teachings. Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta interrupted them while they were talking. </p>
<p id="an6.60:1.5">Then Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita said to Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta, “Venerable, please don’t interrupt the senior mendicants while they’re talking about the teachings. Wait until the end of the discussion.” </p>
<p id="an6.60:1.7">When he said this, Citta Hatthisāriputta’s companions said to Mahākoṭṭhita, “Venerable, please don’t rebuke Citta Hatthisāriputta. He is astute, and quite capable of talking about the teachings with the senior mendicants.” </p>
<p id="an6.60:2.1">“It’s not easy to know this, reverends, for those who don’t comprehend another’s mind. </p>
<p id="an6.60:2.2">Take a person who is the sweetest of the sweet, the most even-tempered of the even-tempered, the calmest of the calm, so long as they live relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role. But when they’re separated from the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role, they mix closely with monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; with rulers and their ministers, and with monastics of other religions and their disciples. As they mix closely, they become intimate and loose, spending time chatting, and so lust infects their mind. They resign the training and return to a lesser life. </p>
<p id="an6.60:3.1">Suppose an ox fond of crops was tied up or shut in a pen. Would it be right to say that that ox will never again invade the crops?” </p>
<p id="an6.60:3.3">“No it would not, reverend. For it’s quite possible that that ox will snap the ropes or break out of the pen, and then invade the crops.” </p>

Thinking, ‘I get the signless immersion of the heart!’ they mix closely with monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; with rulers and their ministers, and with monastics of other religions and their disciples. As they mix closely, they become intimate and loose, spending time chatting, and so lust infects their mind. They resign the training and return to a lesser life. </p>
<p id="an6.60:8.5">Suppose a ruler or their minister, while walking along the road with an army of four divisions, was to arrive at a forest grove where they set up camp for the night. There, because of the noise of the elephants, horses, chariots, soldiers, and the drums, kettledrums, horns, and cymbals, the chirping of crickets would vanish. Would it be right to say that now the chirping of crickets will never be heard in this woodland grove again?” </p>
<p id="an6.60:8.8">“No it would not, reverend. For it is quite possible that the ruler or their minister will depart from that woodland grove so that the chirping of crickets will be heard there again.” </p>

<p id="an6.60:9.1">Then after some time Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta resigned the training and returned to a lesser life. Then the mendicants who were his companions went up to Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita and said, “Did Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita comprehend Citta Hatthisāriputta’s mind and know that he had gained such and such meditative attainments, yet he would still resign the training and return to a lesser life? Or did deities tell you about it?” </p>
<p id="an6.60:9.7">“Reverends, I comprehended his mind and knew this. And deities also told me.” </p>
<p id="an6.60:10.1">Then the mendicants who were Citta Hatthisāriputta’s companions went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, Citta Hatthisāriputta, who had gained such and such meditative attainments, has still resigned the training and returned to a lesser life.” </p>
<p id="an6.60:10.3">“Mendicants, soon Citta will remember renunciation.” </p>
<p id="an6.60:11.1">And not long after Citta Hatthisāriputta shaved off his hair and beard, dressed in ocher robes, and went forth from the lay life to homelessness. Then Citta Hatthisāriputta, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="an6.60:11.3">He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable Citta Hatthisāriputta became one of the perfected. </p>

<p id="an6.61:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana. </p>
<p id="an6.61:1.3">Now at that time, after the meal, on return from almsround, several senior mendicants sat together in the pavilion and this discussion came up among them, “Reverends, this was said by the Buddha in ‘The Way to the Far Shore’, in ‘The Questions of Metteyya’: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an6.61:2.1">‘The thoughtful one who has known both ends, <br/>and is not stuck in the middle: <br/>he is a great man, I declare, <br/>he has escaped the seamstress here.’ </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="an6.61:3.1">But what is one end? What’s the second end? What’s the middle? And who is the seamstress?” When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants: </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an6.61:3.3">“Contact, reverends, is one end. The origin of contact is the second end. The cessation of contact is the middle. And craving is the seamstress, for craving weaves one to being reborn in one state of existence or another. That’s how a mendicant directly knows what should be directly known and completely understands what should be completely understood. Knowing and understanding thus they make an end of suffering in this very life.” </p>
<p id="an6.61:4.1">When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants: </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an6.61:4.2">“The past, reverends, is one end. The future is the second end. The present is the middle. And craving is the seamstress … That’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.” </p>
<p id="an6.61:5.1">When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants: </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an6.61:5.2">“Pleasant feeling, reverends, is one end. Painful feeling is the second end. Neutral feeling is the middle. And craving is the seamstress … That’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.” </p>
<p id="an6.61:6.1">When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants: </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an6.61:6.2">“Name, reverends, is one end. Form is the second end. Consciousness is the middle. And craving is the seamstress … That’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.” </p>
<p id="an6.61:7.1">When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants: </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an6.61:7.2">“The six interior sense fields, reverends, are one end. The six exterior sense fields are the second end. Consciousness is the middle. And craving is the seamstress … That’s how a mendicant directly knows … an end of suffering in this very life.” </p>
<p id="an6.61:8.1">When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants: </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an6.61:8.2">“Identity, reverends, is one end. The origin of identity is the second end. The cessation of identity is the middle. And craving is the seamstress, for craving weaves one to being reborn in one state of existence or another. That’s how a mendicant directly knows what should be directly known and completely understands what should be completely understood. Knowing and understanding thus they make an end of suffering in this very life.” </p>
<p id="an6.61:9.1">When this was said, one of the mendicants said to the senior mendicants: </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an6.61:9.2">“Each of us has spoken from the heart. Come, reverends, let’s go to the Buddha, and inform him about this. As he answers, so we’ll remember it.” </p>
<p id="an6.61:10.1">“Yes, reverend,” those senior mendicants replied. Then those senior mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed. They asked, “Sir, who has spoken well?” </p>
<p id="an6.61:10.5">“Mendicants, you’ve all spoken well in a way. However, this is what I was referring to in ‘The Way to the Far Shore’, in ‘The Questions of Metteyya’ when I said: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an6.61:11.1">‘The sage has known both ends, <br/>and is not stuck in the middle. <br/>He is a great man, I declare, <br/>he has escaped the seamstress here.’ </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="an6.61:12.1">Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="an6.61:12.2">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="an6.61:12.4">“Contact, mendicants, is one end. The origin of contact is the second end. The cessation of contact is the middle. And craving is the seamstress, for craving weaves one to being reborn in one state of existence or another. That’s how a mendicant directly knows what should be directly known and completely understands what should be completely understood. Knowing and understanding thus they make an end of suffering in this very life.” </p>

<p id="an6.62:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Kosalans named Daṇḍakappaka. The Buddha left the road and sat at the root of a tree on the seat spread out. The mendicants entered Daṇḍakappaka to look for a guest house. </p>
<p id="an6.62:2.1">Then Venerable Ānanda together with several mendicants went to the Aciravati River to bathe. When he had bathed and emerged from the water he stood in one robe drying himself. </p>
<p id="an6.62:2.3">Then a certain mendicant went up to Venerable Ānanda, and said to him, “Reverend Ānanda, when the Buddha declared that Devadatta was going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable, did he do so after wholeheartedly deliberating, or was this just a way of speaking?” </p>
<p id="an6.62:2.6">“You’re right, reverend, that’s how the Buddha declared it.” </p>
<p id="an6.62:3.1">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. </p>
<p id="an6.62:4.1">“Ānanda, that mendicant must be junior, recently gone forth, or else a foolish, incompetent senior mendicant. How on earth can he take something that I have declared definitively to be ambiguous? I do not see a single other person about whom I have given such whole-hearted deliberation before making a declaration as I did in the case of Devadatta. </p>
<p id="an6.62:4.4">As long as I saw even a fraction of a hair’s tip of goodness in Devadatta I did not declare that he was going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable. But when I saw that there was not even a fraction of a hair’s tip of goodness in Devadatta I declared that he was going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable. </p>
<p id="an6.62:5.1">Suppose there was a sewer deeper than a man’s height, full to the brim with feces, and someone was sunk into it over their head. Then along comes a person who wants to help make them safe, who wants to lift them out of that sewer. But circling all around the sewer they couldn’t see even a fraction of a hair’s tip of that person that was not smeared with feces. </p>
<p id="an6.62:5.5">In the same way, when I saw that there was not even a fraction of a hair’s tip of goodness in Devadatta I declared that he was going to a place of loss, to hell, there to remain for an eon, irredeemable. Ānanda, if only you would all listen to the Realized One’s analysis of the knowledges of the faculties of individuals.” </p>
<p id="an6.62:6.1">“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! Let the Buddha analyze the faculties of persons. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” </p>
<p id="an6.62:6.3">“Well then, Ānanda, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="an6.62:6.4">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="an6.62:7.1">“Ānanda, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand: ‘Both skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.’ After some time I comprehend their mind and understand: ‘The skillful qualities of this person have vanished, but the unskillful qualities are still present. Nevertheless, their skillful root is unbroken, and from that the skillful will appear. So this person is not liable to decline in the future.’ Suppose some seeds were intact, unspoiled, not weather-damaged, fertile, and well-kept. They’re sown in a well-prepared, productive field. Wouldn’t you know that those seeds would grow, increase, and mature?” </p>
<p id="an6.62:7.9">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an6.62:7.10">“In the same way, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand … This person is not liable to decline in the future … This is how another individual is known to the Realized One by comprehending their mind. And this is how the Realized One knows a person’s faculties by comprehending their mind. And this is how the Realized One knows the future origination of a person’s qualities by comprehending their mind. </p>
<p id="an6.62:8.1">When I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand: ‘Both skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.’ After some time I comprehend their mind and understand: ‘The unskillful qualities of this person have vanished, but the skillful qualities are still present. Nevertheless, their unskillful root is unbroken, and from that the unskillful will appear. So this person is still liable to decline in the future.’ Suppose some seeds were intact, unspoiled, not weather-damaged, fertile, and well-kept. And they were sown on a broad rock. Wouldn’t you know that those seeds would not grow, increase, and mature?” </p>
<p id="an6.62:8.9">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an6.62:8.10">“In the same way, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand … This person is still liable to decline in the future … This is how another individual is known to the Realized One … </p>
<p id="an6.62:9.1">When I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand: ‘Both skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.’ After some time I comprehend their mind and understand: ‘This person has not even a fraction of a hair’s tip of goodness. They have exclusively dark, unskillful qualities. When their body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’ Suppose some seeds were broken, spoiled, weather-damaged. They’re sown in a well-prepared, productive field. Wouldn’t you know that those seeds would not grow, increase, and mature?” </p>
<p id="an6.62:9.7">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an6.62:9.8">“In the same way, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand … ‘This person has not even a fraction of a hair’s tip of goodness. They have exclusively dark, unskillful qualities. When their body breaks up, after death, they will be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’ …” </p>
<p id="an6.62:10.1">When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, “Sir, can you describe three other persons who are counterparts of these three?” </p>
<p id="an6.62:10.3">“I can, Ānanda,” said the Buddha. “Ānanda, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand: ‘Both skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.’ After some time I comprehend their mind and understand: ‘The skillful qualities of this person have vanished, but the unskillful qualities are still present. Nevertheless, their skillful root is unbroken, but it’s about to be totally destroyed. So this person is still liable to decline in the future.’ Suppose that there were some burning coals, blazing and glowing. And they were placed on a broad rock. Wouldn’t you know that those coals would not grow, increase, and spread?” </p>
<p id="an6.62:10.12">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an6.62:10.13">“Or suppose it was the late afternoon and the sun was going down. Wouldn’t you know that the light was about to vanish and darkness appear?” </p>
<p id="an6.62:10.14">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an6.62:10.15">“Or suppose that it’s nearly time for the midnight meal. Wouldn’t you know that the light had vanished and the darkness appeared?” </p>
<p id="an6.62:10.16">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an6.62:10.17">“In the same way, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand … This person is still liable to decline in the future … </p>
<p id="an6.62:11.1">When I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand: ‘Both skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.’ After some time I comprehend their mind and understand: ‘The unskillful qualities of this person have vanished, but the skillful qualities are still present. Nevertheless, their unskillful root is unbroken, but it’s about to be totally destroyed. So this person is not liable to decline in the future.’ Suppose that there were some burning coals, blazing and glowing. They were placed on a pile of grass or timber. Wouldn’t you know that those coals would grow, increase, and spread?” </p>
<p id="an6.62:11.9">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an6.62:11.10">“Suppose it’s the crack of dawn and the sun is rising. Wouldn’t you know that the dark will vanish and the light appear?” </p>
<p id="an6.62:11.11">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an6.62:11.12">“Or suppose that it’s nearly time for the midday meal. Wouldn’t you know that the dark had vanished and the light appeared?” </p>
<p id="an6.62:11.13">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an6.62:11.14">“In the same way, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand … This person is not liable to decline in the future … </p>
<p id="an6.62:12.1">When I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand: ‘Both skillful and unskillful qualities are found in this person.’ After some time I comprehend their mind and understand: ‘This person has not even a fraction of a hair’s tip of unskillful qualities. They have exclusively bright, blameless qualities. They will become extinguished in this very life.’ Suppose that there were some cool, extinguished coals. They were placed on a pile of grass or timber. Wouldn’t you know that those coals would not grow, increase, and spread?” </p>
<p id="an6.62:12.7">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an6.62:12.8">“In the same way, when I’ve comprehended the mind of a person, I understand … ‘This person has not even a fraction of a hair’s tip of unskillful qualities.

And this is how the Realized One knows a person’s faculties by comprehending their mind. And this is how the Realized One knows the future origination of a person’s qualities by comprehending their mind. </p>
<p id="an6.62:13.1">And so, Ānanda, of the first three people one is not liable to decline, one is liable to decline, and one is bound for a place of loss, hell. And of the second three people, one is liable to decline, one is not liable to decline, and one is bound to become extinguished.” </p>

<p id="an6.63:1.1">“Mendicants, I will teach you a penetrative exposition of the teaching. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="an6.63:1.3">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an6.63:2.1">“Mendicants, what is the penetrative exposition of the teaching? Sensual pleasures should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an6.63:3.1">Feelings should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known. </p>

<p data-counter="6" id="an6.63:7.1">Suffering should be known. And its source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation should be known. </p>
<p id="an6.63:8.1">‘Sensual pleasures should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? There are these five kinds of sensual stimulation. Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. Sounds known by the ear … Smells known by the nose … Tastes known by the tongue … Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. However, these are not sensual pleasures. In the training of the Noble One they’re called ‘kinds of sensual stimulation’. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an6.63:8.10">Greedy intention is a person’s sensual pleasure. <br/>The world’s pretty things aren’t sensual pleasures. <br/>Greedy intention is a person’s sensual pleasure. <br/>The world’s pretty things stay just as they are, <br/>but a wise one removes desire for them. </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="an6.63:9.1">And what is the source of sensual pleasures? Contact is their source. </p>
<p id="an6.63:11.1">And what is the diversity of sensual pleasures? The sensual desire for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches are all different. This is called the diversity of sensual pleasures. </p>
<p id="an6.63:12.1">And what is the result of sensual pleasures? When one who desires sensual pleasures creates a corresponding life-form, with the attributes of either good or bad deeds—this is called the result of sensual pleasures. </p>
<p id="an6.63:13.1">And what is the cessation of sensual pleasures? When contact ceases, sensual pleasures cease. The practice that leads to the cessation of sensual pleasures is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an6.63:14.1">When a noble disciple understands sensual pleasures in this way—and understands their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation—they understand that this penetrative spiritual life is the cessation of sensual pleasures. ‘Sensual pleasures should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. </p>
<p id="an6.63:15.1">‘Feelings should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? There are these three feelings: pleasant, painful, and neutral. </p>
<p id="an6.63:16.1">And what is the source of feelings? Contact is their source. </p>
<p id="an6.63:17.1">And what is the diversity of feelings? There are pleasant feelings of the flesh, pleasant feelings not of the flesh, painful feelings of the flesh, painful feelings not of the flesh, neutral feelings of the flesh, and neutral feelings not of the flesh.

<p id="an6.63:21.1">‘Perceptions should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? There are these six perceptions: perceptions of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts. </p>
<p id="an6.63:22.1">And what is the source of perceptions? Contact is their source. </p>
<p id="an6.63:23.1">And what is the diversity of perceptions? The perceptions of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts are all different. This is called the diversity of perceptions. </p>

<p id="an6.63:27.1">‘Defilements should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? There are these three defilements: the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. </p>
<p id="an6.63:28.1">And what is the source of defilements? Ignorance is the source of defilements. </p>
<p id="an6.63:29.1">And what is the diversity of defilements? There are defilements that lead to rebirth in hell, the animal realm, the ghost realm, the human world, and the world of the gods. This is called the diversity of defilements. </p>

<p id="an6.63:33.1">‘Deeds should be known. And their source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to their cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? It is intention that I call deeds. For after making a choice one acts by way of body, speech, and mind. </p>
<p id="an6.63:34.1">And what is the source of deeds? Contact is their source. </p>
<p id="an6.63:35.1">And what is the diversity of deeds? There are deeds that lead to rebirth in hell, the animal realm, the ghost realm, the human world, and the world of the gods. This is called the diversity of deeds. </p>
<p id="an6.63:36.1">And what is the result of deeds? The result of deeds is threefold, I say: in this very life, on rebirth in the next life, or at some later time. This is called the result of deeds. </p>
<p id="an6.63:37.1">And what is the cessation of deeds? When contact ceases, deeds cease. The practice that leads to the cessation of deeds is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. </p>

<p id="an6.63:39.1">‘Suffering should be known. And its source, diversity, result, cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation should be known.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; illness is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering. </p>
<p id="an6.63:40.1">And what is the source of suffering? Craving is the source of suffering. </p>
<p id="an6.63:41.1">And what is the diversity of suffering? There is suffering that is severe, mild, slow to fade, and quick to fade. This is called the diversity of suffering. </p>
<p id="an6.63:42.1">And what is the result of suffering? It’s when someone who is overcome and overwhelmed by suffering sorrows and wails and laments, beating their breast and falling into confusion. Or else, overcome by that suffering, they begin an external search, wondering: ‘Who knows one or two phrases to stop this suffering?’ The result of suffering is either confusion or a search, I say. This is called the result of suffering. </p>
<p id="an6.63:43.1">And what is the cessation of suffering? When craving ceases, suffering ceases. The practice that leads to the cessation of suffering is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion. </p>

<p data-counter="1" id="an6.64:1.3">Firstly, the Realized One truly understands the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an6.64:2.1">Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the result of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of grounds and causes. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. … </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an6.64:3.1">Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. … </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an6.64:4.1">Furthermore, the Realized One recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. He remembers: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so he recollects his many kinds of past lives, with features and details. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. … </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an6.64:5.1">Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Realized One sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. … </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an6.64:6.1">Furthermore, the Realized One has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And he lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel. These are the six powers of a Realized One that the Realized One possesses. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an6.64:7.1">If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible, the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an6.64:8.1">If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of the result of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of grounds and causes, the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an6.64:9.1">If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments, the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an6.64:10.1">If others come to the Realized One and ask questions about his true knowledge of recollection of past lives, the Realized One answers them in whatever manner he has truly known it. </p>

<p id="an6.64:13.1">And I say that true knowledge of the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion. And true knowledge of the result of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of grounds and causes is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion. And true knowledge of corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion. And true knowledge of the recollection of past lives is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion. And true knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of sentient beings is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion. And true knowledge of the ending of defilements is for those with immersion, not for those without immersion. </p>
<p id="an6.64:13.7">And so, mendicants, immersion is the path. No immersion is the wrong path.” </p>

<p data-counter="1" id="an7.4:2.1">And what is the power of faith? It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ This is called the power of faith. </p>

<p data-counter="3" id="an7.4:4.1">And what is the power of conscience? It’s when a noble disciple has a conscience.

<p data-counter="6" id="an7.4:7.1">And what is the power of immersion? It’s when a noble disciple, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. … Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. This is called the power of immersion. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an7.4:8.1">And what is the power of wisdom? It’s when a noble disciple is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. This is called the power of wisdom. </p>

<p id="an7.47:1.1">Now at that time the brahmin Uggatasarīra had prepared a large sacrifice. Bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats and rams—five hundred of each—had been led to the post for the sacrifice. </p>
<p id="an7.47:1.3">Then the brahmin Uggatasarīra went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, “Master Gotama, I have heard that kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post is very fruitful and beneficial.” </p>
<p id="an7.47:2.2">“I’ve also heard this, brahmin.” </p>
<p id="an7.47:2.3">For a second time … and third time Uggatasarīra said to the Buddha, “Master Gotama, I have heard that kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post is very fruitful and beneficial.” </p>
<p id="an7.47:2.6">“I’ve also heard this, brahmin.” </p>
<p id="an7.47:2.7">“Then Master Gotama and I are in total agreement in this matter.” </p>
<p id="an7.47:3.1">When he said this, Venerable Ānanda said to Uggatasarīra, “Brahmin, you shouldn’t ask the Buddha in this way. You should ask in this way: ‘Sir, I want to kindle the sacrificial fire and raise the sacrificial post. May the Buddha please advise and instruct me. It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.’” </p>
<p id="an7.47:4.1">Then Uggatasarīra said to the Buddha, “Sir, I want to kindle the sacrificial fire and raise the sacrificial post. May Master Gotama please advise and instruct me. It will be for my lasting welfare and happiness.” </p>
<p id="an7.47:5.1">“Even before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post, one raises three unskillful knives which ripen and result in suffering. What three? The knives of the body, speech, and mind. Even before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post one gives rise to the thought: ‘May this many bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, and rams be slaughtered for the sacrifice!’ Thinking, ‘May I make merit’, one makes bad karma. Thinking, ‘May I do good’, one does bad. Thinking, ‘May I seek the path to a good rebirth’, one seeks the path to a bad rebirth. Even before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post one raises this first unskillful mental knife which ripens and results in suffering. </p>
<p id="an7.47:6.1">Furthermore, even before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post, one says such things as: ‘May this many bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, and rams be slaughtered for the sacrifice!’ Thinking, ‘May I make merit’, one makes bad karma. Thinking, ‘May I do good’, one does bad. Thinking, ‘May I seek the path to a good rebirth’, one seeks the path to a bad rebirth. Even before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post one raises this second unskillful verbal knife which ripens and results in suffering. </p>
<p id="an7.47:7.1">Furthermore, even before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post one first personally undertakes preparations for the sacrificial slaughter of bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, and rams. Thinking, ‘May I make merit’, one makes bad karma. Thinking, ‘May I do good’, one does bad. Thinking, ‘May I seek the path to a good rebirth’, one seeks the path to a bad rebirth. Even before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post, one raises this third unskillful bodily knife which ripens and results in suffering. Even before kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post, one raises these three unskillful knives which ripen and result in suffering. </p>
<p id="an7.47:8.1">Brahmin, these three fires should be given up and rejected, not cultivated. What three? The fires of greed, hate, and delusion. </p>
<p id="an7.47:9.1">And why should the fire of greed be given up and rejected, not cultivated? A greedy person does bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. That’s why the fire of greed should be given up and rejected, not cultivated. </p>
<p id="an7.47:10.1">And why should the fire of hate be given up and rejected, not cultivated? A hateful person does bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. That’s why the fire of hate should be given up and rejected, not cultivated. </p>
<p id="an7.47:11.1">And why should the fire of delusion be given up and rejected, not cultivated? A deluded person does bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. That’s why the fire of delusion should be given up and rejected, not cultivated. These three fires should be given up and rejected, not cultivated. </p>
<p id="an7.47:12.1">Brahmin, you should properly and happily take care of three fires, honoring, respecting, esteeming, and venerating them. What three? The fire of those worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods. The fire of a householder. And the fire of those worthy of a religious donation. </p>
<p id="an7.47:13.1">And what is the fire of those worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods? Your mother and father are called the fire of those worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods. Why is that? Since it is from them that you’ve been incubated and produced. So you should properly and happily take care of this fire, honoring, respecting, esteeming, and venerating it. </p>
<p id="an7.47:14.1">And what is the fire of a householder? Your children, partners, bondservants, employees, and workers are called a householder’s fire. So you should properly and happily take care of this fire, honoring, respecting, esteeming, and venerating it. </p>
<p id="an7.47:15.1">And what is the fire of those worthy of a religious donation? The ascetics and brahmins who avoid intoxication and negligence, are settled in patience and gentleness, and who tame, calm, and extinguish themselves are called the fire of those worthy of a religious donation. So you should properly and happily take care of this fire, honoring, respecting, esteeming, and venerating it. You should properly and happily take care of these three fires, honoring, respecting, esteeming, and venerating them. </p>
<p id="an7.47:16.1">But the wood fire, brahmin, should, from time to time, be fanned, watched over with equanimity, extinguished, or put aside.” </p>
<p id="an7.47:17.1">When he said this, the brahmin Uggatasarīra said to the Buddha, “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! … From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. Master Gotama, I now set free these five hundred bulls, five hundred bullocks, five hundred heifers, five hundred goats, and five hundred rams. I give them life! May they eat grass and drink cool water and enjoy a cool breeze!” </p>

<p id="an7.48:2.1">What seven? The perceptions of ugliness, death, repulsiveness of food, dissatisfaction with the whole world, impermanence, suffering in impermanence, and not-self in suffering.

<p id="an7.49:1.1">“Mendicants, these seven perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are very fruitful and beneficial. They culminate in the deathless and end with the deathless. What seven? The perceptions of ugliness, death, repulsiveness of food, dissatisfaction with the whole world, impermanence, suffering in impermanence, and not-self in suffering. These seven perceptions, when developed and cultivated, are very fruitful and beneficial. They culminate in the deathless and end with the deathless. </p>
<p id="an7.49:2.1">‘When the perception of ugliness is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in the deathless and ends with the deathless.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? When a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of ugliness, their mind draws back from sexual intercourse. They shrink away, turn aside, and don’t get drawn into it. And either equanimity or revulsion become stabilized. It’s like a chicken’s feather or a scrap of sinew thrown in a fire. It shrivels up, shrinks, rolls up, and doesn’t stretch out. In the same way, when a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of ugliness, their mind draws back from sexual intercourse. … </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an7.49:3.1">If a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of ugliness, but their mind is drawn to sexual intercourse, and not repulsed, they should know: ‘My perception of ugliness is undeveloped. I don’t have any distinction higher than before. I haven’t attained a fruit of development.’ In this way they are aware of the situation. But if a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of ugliness, their mind draws back from sexual intercourse … they should know: ‘My perception of ugliness is well developed. I have realized a distinction higher than before. I have attained a fruit of development.’ In this way they are aware of the situation. ‘When the perception of ugliness is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in the deathless and ends with the deathless.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an7.49:4.1">‘When the perception of death is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in the deathless and ends with the deathless.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? When a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of death, their mind draws back from desire to be reborn. … That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an7.49:6.1">‘When the perception of the repulsiveness of food is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in the deathless and ends with the deathless.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? When a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of the repulsiveness of food, their mind draws back from craving for tastes. … That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an7.49:8.1">‘When the perception of dissatisfaction with the whole world is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in the deathless and ends with the deathless.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? When a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of dissatisfaction with the whole world, their mind draws back from the world’s shiny things. … That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an7.49:10.1">‘When the perception of impermanence is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in the deathless and ends with the deathless.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? When a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of impermanence, their mind draws back from material possessions, honors, and fame. … That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an7.49:12.1">‘When the perception of suffering in impermanence is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in the deathless and ends with the deathless.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? When a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of suffering in impermanence, they establish a keen perception of the danger of sloth, laziness, slackness, negligence, lack of commitment, and failure to review, like a killer with a drawn sword. … That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. </p>
<p id="an7.49:14.1">‘When the perception of not-self in suffering is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in the deathless and ends with the deathless.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? When a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of not-self in suffering, their mind is rid of ego, possessiveness, and conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli. It has gone beyond discrimination, and is peaceful and well freed. </p>
<p id="an7.49:15.1">If a mendicant often meditates with a mind reinforced with the perception of not-self in suffering, but their mind is not rid of  ego, possessiveness, and conceit for this conscious body and all external stimuli; nor has it gone beyond discrimination, and is not peaceful or well freed, they should know: ‘My perception of not-self in suffering is undeveloped.

<p id="an7.50:1.1">Then the brahmin Jānussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, “Does Master Gotama claim to be celibate?” </p>
<p id="an7.50:1.4">“Brahmin, if anyone should be rightly said to live the celibate life unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, full and pure, it’s me.” </p>
<p id="an7.50:1.7">“But what, Master Gotama, is a break, taint, stain, or mar in celibacy?” </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an7.50:2.1">“Firstly, an ascetic or brahmin who claims to be perfectly celibate does not mutually engage in sex with a female. However, they consent to being anointed, massaged, bathed, and rubbed by a female. They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying. This is a break, taint, stain, or mar in celibacy. This is called one who lives the celibate life impurely, yoked by the yoke of sex. They’re not freed from rebirth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They’re not freed from suffering, I say. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an7.50:3.1">Furthermore, an ascetic or brahmin who claims to be perfectly celibate does not mutually engage in sex with a female. Nor do they consent to massage and bathing. However, they giggle and play and have fun with females. … </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an7.50:4.1">they gaze into a female’s eyes. … </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an7.50:5.1">they listen through a wall or rampart to the sound of females laughing or chatting or singing or crying. … </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an7.50:6.1">they recall when they used to laugh, chat, and have fun with females … </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an7.50:7.1">they see a householder or their child amusing themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. … </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an7.50:8.1">They don’t see a householder or their child amusing themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. However, they live the celibate life wishing to be reborn in one of the orders of gods. They think: ‘By this precept or observance or fervent austerity or spiritual life, may I become one of the gods!’ They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying. This is a break, taint, stain, or mar in celibacy. This is called one who lives the celibate life impurely, yoked by the yoke of sex. They’re not free from rebirth, old age, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They’re not free from suffering, I say. </p>
<p id="an7.50:9.1">As long as I saw that these seven sexual yokes—or even one of them—had not been given up in me, I didn’t announce my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. </p>
<p id="an7.50:10.1">But when I saw that these seven sexual yokes—every one of them—had been given up in me, I announced my supreme perfect awakening in this world with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans. Knowledge and vision arose in me: ‘My freedom is unshakable; this is my last rebirth; now there’ll be no more future lives.’” </p>
<p id="an7.50:11.1">When he said this, the brahmin Jānussoṇi said to the Buddha, “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! … From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<p id="an7.51:2.1">A woman focuses on her own femininity: her feminine moves, feminine appearance, feminine ways, feminine desires, feminine voice, and feminine adornment. She’s stimulated by this and takes pleasure in it. So she focuses on the masculinity of others: masculine moves, masculine appearance, masculine ways, masculine desires, masculine voice, and masculine adornment. She’s stimulated by this and takes pleasure in it. So she desires to yoke herself to another. And she desires the pleasure and happiness that comes from such yoking.

<p id="an7.52:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. </p>
<p id="an7.52:1.2">Then several lay followers of Campā went to Venerable Sāriputta, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, it’s been a long time since we’ve heard a Dhamma talk from the Buddha. It would be good if we got to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.” </p>
<p id="an7.52:1.5">“Well then, reverends, come on the next sabbath day. Hopefully you’ll get to hear a Dhamma talk from the Buddha.” </p>
<p id="an7.52:1.7">“Yes, sir” they replied. Then they rose from their seats, bowed to Sāriputta, and respectfully circled him before leaving. </p>
<p id="an7.52:2.1">Then on the next sabbath the lay followers of Campā went to Venerable Sāriputta, bowed, and stood to one side. Then they went together with Sāriputta to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Sāriputta said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="an7.52:3.1">“Sir, could it be that someone gives a gift and it is not very fruitful or beneficial, while someone else gives exactly the same gift and it is very fruitful and beneficial?” </p>
<p id="an7.52:3.3">“Indeed it could, Sāriputta.” </p>
<p id="an7.52:3.5">“Sir, what is the cause, what is the reason for this?” </p>
<p id="an7.52:4.1">“Sāriputta, take the case of a someone who gives a gift as an investment, their mind tied to it, expecting to keep it, thinking ‘I’ll enjoy this in my next life’.

<p id="an7.53:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the venerables Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna were wandering in the Southern Hills together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. Now at that time the laywoman Veḷukaṇṭakī, Nanda’s mother, rose at the crack of dawn and recited the verses of “The Way to the Far Shore”. </p>
<p id="an7.53:2.1">And at that time the great king Vessavaṇa was on his way from the north to the south on some business. He heard Nanda’s Mother reciting, and stood waiting for her to finish. </p>
<p id="an7.53:3.1">Then when her recital was over she fell silent. Then, knowing she had finished, Vessavaṇa applauded, saying, “Good, sister! Good, sister!” </p>
<p id="an7.53:3.4">“But who might you be, my dear?” </p>
<p id="an7.53:3.5">“Sister, I am your brother Vessavaṇa, the great king.” </p>
<p id="an7.53:3.6">“Good, my dear! Then may my recital of the teaching be my offering to you as my guest.” </p>
<p id="an7.53:3.7">‘Good, sister! And let this also be your offering to me as your guest. Tomorrow, the mendicant Saṅgha headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna will arrive at Veḷukaṇṭa before breakfast. When you’ve served the Saṅgha, please dedicate the religious donation to me. Then that will also be your offering to me as your guest.” </p>
<p id="an7.53:4.1">And when the night had passed the lay woman Nanda’s Mother had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in her own home. Then the Saṅgha of mendicants headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna arrived at Veḷukaṇṭa. Then Nanda’s Mother addressed a man, “Please, mister, go to the monastery and announce the time to the Saṅgha, saying: ‘Sirs, it’s time. The meal is ready in the home of the lady Nanda’s Mother.’” </p>
<p id="an7.53:4.6">“Yes, Ma’am,” that man replied, and he did as she said. </p>
<p id="an7.53:4.8">And then the Saṅgha of mendicants headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, went to the home of Nanda’s Mother, where they sat on the seats spread out. Then Nanda’s Mother served and satisfied them with her own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods. </p>
<p id="an7.53:5.1">When Sāriputta had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Nanda’s Mother sat down to one side. Sāriputta said to her, “Nanda’s Mother, who told you that the Saṅgha of mendicants was about to arrive?” </p>
<p id="an7.53:6.1">“Sir, last night I rose at the crack of dawn and recited the verses of ‘The Way to the Far Shore’, and then I fell silent. Then the great king Vessavaṇa, knowing I had finished, applauded me, ‘Good, sister! Good, sister!’ </p>
<p id="an7.53:6.4">I asked: ‘But who might you be, my dear?’ </p>
<p id="an7.53:6.5">‘Sister, I am your brother Vessavaṇa, the great king.’ </p>
<p id="an7.53:6.6">‘Good, my dear! Then may my recital of the teaching be my offering to you as my guest.’ </p>
<p id="an7.53:6.7">‘Good, sister! And let this also be your offering to me as your guest. Tomorrow, the mendicant Saṅgha headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna will arrive at Veḷukaṇṭa before breakfast. When you’ve served the Saṅgha, please dedicate the religious donation to me. Then that will also be your offering to me as your guest.’ </p>
<p id="an7.53:6.10">And so, sir, may the merit and the growth of merit in this gift be for the happiness of the great king Vessavaṇa.” </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an7.53:7.1">“It’s incredible, Nanda’s Mother, it’s amazing that you converse face to face with a mighty and illustrious god like the great king Vessavaṇa.” </p>
<p id="an7.53:8.1">“Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality; there is another. I had an only son called Nanda who I loved dearly. The rulers forcibly abducted him on some pretext and had him executed. But I can’t recall getting upset when my boy was under arrest or being arrested, imprisoned or being put in prison, killed or being killed.” </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an7.53:8.6">“It’s incredible, Nanda’s Mother, it’s amazing that you purify even the arising of a thought.” </p>
<p id="an7.53:9.1">“Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality; there is another. When my husband passed away he was reborn in one of the realms of spirits. He revealed to me his previous life-form. But I can’t recall getting upset on that account.” </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an7.53:9.6">“It’s incredible, Nanda’s Mother, it’s amazing that you purify even the arising of a thought.” </p>
<p id="an7.53:10.1">“Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality; there is another. Ever since we were both young, and I was given in marriage to my husband, I can’t recall betraying him even in thought, still less in deed.” </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an7.53:10.4">“It’s incredible, Nanda’s Mother, it’s amazing that you purify even the arising of a thought.” </p>
<p id="an7.53:11.1">“Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality; there is another. Ever since I declared myself a lay follower, I can’t recall deliberately breaking any precept.” </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an7.53:11.4">“It’s incredible, Nanda’s Mother, it’s amazing!” </p>
<p id="an7.53:12.1">“Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality; there is another. Whenever I want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, I enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, I enter and remain in the third absorption, where I meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.” </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an7.53:12.7">“It’s incredible, Nanda’s Mother, it’s amazing!” </p>
<p id="an7.53:13.1">“Sir, this is not my only incredible and amazing quality; there is another. Of the five lower fetters taught by the Buddha, I don’t see any that I haven’t given up.” </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an7.53:13.4">“It’s incredible, Nanda’s Mother, it’s amazing!” </p>
<p id="an7.53:14.1">Then Venerable Sāriputta educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Nanda’s Mother with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. </p>

<p id="an7.56:1.3">Then, late at night, two glorious deities, lighting up the entire Vulture’s Peak, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and stood to one side. One deity said to him, “Sir, these nuns are freed!” </p>
<p id="an7.56:1.5">The other deity said to him, “Sir, these nuns are well freed without anything left over!” </p>
<p id="an7.56:1.7">This is what those deities said, and the teacher approved. Then those deities, knowing that the teacher approved, bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before vanishing right there. </p>
<p id="an7.56:2.1">Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened. </p>
<p id="an7.56:3.1">Now at that time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was sitting not far from the Buddha. He thought, “Which gods know whether a person has anything left over or not?” </p>
<p id="an7.56:3.5">Now, at that time a monk called Tissa had recently passed away and been reborn in a Brahmā realm. There they knew that Tissa the Brahmā was very mighty and powerful. </p>
<p id="an7.56:4.1">And then Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Vulture’s Peak and reappeared in that Brahmā realm. </p>
<p id="an7.56:4.2">Tissa saw Moggallāna coming off in the distance, and said to him, “Come, my good Moggallāna! Welcome, my good Moggallāna! It’s been a long time since you took the opportunity to come here. Sit, my good Moggallāna, this seat is for you.” </p>
<p id="an7.56:4.8">Moggallāna sat down on the seat spread out. Then Tissa bowed to Moggallāna and sat to one side. </p>
<p id="an7.56:4.10">Moggallāna said to him, “Which gods know whether a person has anything left over or not?” </p>

Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the Brahmā realm and reappeared on the Vulture’s Peak.

<p id="an7.61:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood. </p>
<p id="an7.61:1.3">Now at that time, in the land of the Magadhans near Kallavāḷamutta Village, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was nodding off while meditating. The Buddha saw him with his clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman. Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood in the land of the Bhaggas and reappeared in front of Mahāmoggallāna near Kallavāḷamutta Village in the land of the Magadhans. </p>
<p id="an7.61:1.7">He sat on the seat spread out and said to Mahāmoggallāna, “Are you nodding off, Moggallāna? Are you nodding off?” </p>
<p id="an7.61:2.2">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an7.61:2.3">“So, Moggallāna, don’t focus on or cultivate the perception that you were meditating on when you fell drowsy. It’s possible that you’ll give up drowsiness in this way. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an7.61:3.1">But what if that doesn’t work? Then think about and consider the teaching as you’ve learned and memorized it, examining it with your mind. It’s possible that you’ll give up drowsiness in this way. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an7.61:4.1">But what if that doesn’t work? Then recite in detail the teaching as you’ve learned and memorized it. It’s possible that you’ll give up drowsiness in this way. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an7.61:5.1">But what if that doesn’t work? Then pinch your ears and rub your limbs. It’s possible that you’ll give up drowsiness in this way. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an7.61:6.1">But what if that doesn’t work? Then get up from your seat, flush your eyes with water, look around in every direction, and look up at the stars and constellations. It’s possible that you’ll give up drowsiness in this way. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an7.61:7.1">But what if that doesn’t work? Then focus on the perception of light, concentrating on the perception of day: as by day, so by night; as by night, so by day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, develop a mind that’s full of radiance. It’s possible that you’ll give up drowsiness in this way. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an7.61:8.1">But what if that doesn’t work? Then walk mindfully, concentrating on the perception of continuity, your faculties directed inwards and your mind not scattered outside. It’s possible that you’ll give up drowsiness in this way. </p>
<p id="an7.61:9.1">But what if that doesn’t work? Then lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. When you wake, you should get up quickly, thinking: ‘I will not live indulging in the pleasures of sleeping, lying down, and drowsing.’ That’s how you should train. </p>
<p id="an7.61:10.1">So you should train like this: ‘I will not approach families with my head swollen with vanity.’ That’s how you should train. What happens if a mendicant approaches families with a head swollen with vanity? Well, families have business to attend to, so people might not notice when a mendicant arrives. In that case the mendicant thinks: ‘Who on earth has turned this family against me? It seems they don’t like me any more.’ And so, because they don’t get anything they feel dismayed. Being dismayed, they become restless. Being restless, they lose restraint. And without restraint the mind is far from immersion. </p>
<p id="an7.61:11.1">So you should train like this: ‘I won’t get into arguments.’ That’s how you should train. When there’s an argument, you can expect there’ll be lots of talking. When there’s lots of talking, people become restless. Being restless, they lose restraint. And without restraint the mind is far from immersion. Moggallāna, I don’t praise all kinds of closeness. Nor do I criticize all kinds of closeness. I don’t praise closeness with laypeople and renunciates. I do praise closeness with those lodgings that are quiet and still, far from the madding crowd, remote from human settlements, and fit for retreat.” </p>
<p id="an7.61:12.1">When he said this, Venerable Moggallāna asked the Buddha, “Sir, how do you briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans?” </p>
<p id="an7.61:13.1">“It’s when a mendicant has heard: ‘Nothing is worth insisting on.’ When a mendicant has heard that nothing is worth insisting on, they directly know all things. Directly knowing all things, they completely understand all things. Having completely understood all things, when they experience any kind of feeling—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—they meditate observing impermanence, dispassion, cessation, and letting go in those feelings. Meditating in this way, they don’t grasp at anything in the world. Not grasping, they’re not anxious. Not being anxious, they personally become extinguished. </p>
<p id="an7.61:13.9">They understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ That’s how I briefly define a mendicant who is freed through the ending of craving, who has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal, and is best among gods and humans.” </p>

My dominion extended to all four sides, I achieved stability in the country, and I possessed the seven treasures. These were my seven treasures: the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure.

<p id="an7.64:1.1">“Mendicants, these seven things that please and assist an enemy happen to an irritable woman or man. What seven? </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an7.64:1.3">Firstly, an enemy wishes for an enemy: ‘If only they’d become ugly!’ Why is that? Because an enemy doesn’t like to have a beautiful enemy. An irritable person, overcome and overwhelmed by anger, is ugly, even though they’re nicely bathed and anointed, with hair and beard dressed, and wearing white clothes. This is the first thing that pleases and assists an enemy which happens to an irritable woman or man. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an7.64:2.1">Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy: ‘If only they’d sleep badly!’ Why is that? Because an enemy doesn’t like to have an enemy who sleeps at ease. An irritable person, overcome and overwhelmed by anger, sleeps badly, even though they sleep on a couch spread with woolen covers—shag-piled, pure white, or embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red pillows at both ends. This is the second thing … </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an7.64:3.1">Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy: ‘If only they don’t get all they need!’ Why is that? Because an enemy doesn’t like to have an enemy who gets all they need. When an irritable person, overcome and overwhelmed by anger, gets what they don’t need they think, ‘I’ve got what I need.’ When they get what they need they think, ‘I’ve got what I don’t need.’ When an angry person gets these things that are the exact opposite of what they need, it’s for their lasting harm and suffering. This is the third thing … </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an7.64:4.1">Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy: ‘If only they weren’t wealthy!’ Why is that? Because an enemy doesn’t like to have an enemy who is wealthy. When a person is irritable, overcome and overwhelmed by anger, the rulers seize the legitimate wealth they’ve earned by their efforts, built up with their own hands, gathered by the sweat of their brow. This is the fourth thing … </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an7.64:5.1">Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy: ‘If only they weren’t famous!’ Why is that? Because an enemy doesn’t like to have a famous enemy. When a person is irritable, overcome and overwhelmed by anger, any fame they have acquired by diligence falls to dust. This is the fifth thing … </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an7.64:6.1">Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy: ‘If only they had no friends!’ Why is that? Because an enemy doesn’t like to have an enemy with friends. When a person is irritable, overcome and overwhelmed by anger, their friends and colleagues, relatives and kin avoid them from afar. This is the sixth thing … </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an7.64:7.1">Furthermore, an enemy wishes for an enemy: ‘If only, when their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell!’ Why is that? Because an enemy doesn’t like to have an enemy who goes to a good place. When a person is irritable, overcome and overwhelmed by anger, they do bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. This is the seventh thing that pleases and assists an enemy which happens to an irritable woman or man. </p>

<p id="an7.64:11.1">Mad with anger, <br/>they fall into disgrace. <br/>Family, friends, and loved ones <br/>avoid an irritable person. </p>
<p id="an7.64:12.1">Anger creates harm; <br/>anger upsets the mind. <br/>That person doesn’t recognize <br/>the danger that arises within. </p>
<p id="an7.64:13.1">An angry person doesn’t know the good. <br/>An angry person doesn’t see the truth. <br/>When a person is beset by anger, <br/>only blind darkness is left. </p>
<p id="an7.64:14.1">An angry person destroys with ease <br/>what was hard to build. <br/>Afterwards, when the anger is spent, <br/>they’re tormented as if burnt by fire. </p>
<p id="an7.64:15.1">Their look betrays their sulkiness <br/>like a fire’s smoky plume. <br/>And when their anger flares up, <br/>they make others angry. </p>
<p id="an7.64:16.1">They have no conscience or prudence, <br/>nor any respectful speech. <br/>One overcome by anger <br/>has no island refuge anywhere. </p>
<p id="an7.64:17.1">The deeds that torment a man <br/>are far from those that are good. <br/>I’ll explain them now; <br/>listen to this, for it is the truth. </p>
<p id="an7.64:18.1">An angry person slays their father; <br/>their mother, too, they slay. <br/>An angry person slays a saint; <br/>a normal person, too, they slay. </p>
<p id="an7.64:19.1">A man is raised by his mother, <br/>who shows him the world. <br/>But an angry ordinary person slays <br/>even that good woman who gave him life. </p>
<p id="an7.64:20.1">Like oneself, all sentient beings <br/>hold themselves most dear. <br/>But angry people kill themselves all kinds of ways, <br/>distraught for many reasons. </p>
<p id="an7.64:21.1">Some kill themselves with swords, <br/>some, distraught, take poison. <br/>Some hang themselves with rope, <br/>or fling themselves down a mountain gorge. </p>
<p id="an7.64:22.1">When they commit deeds of destroying life <br/>and killing themselves, <br/>they don’t realize what they do, <br/>for anger leads to their downfall. </p>
<p id="an7.64:23.1">The snare of death in the form of anger <br/>lies hidden in the heart. <br/>You should cut it out by self-control, <br/>by wisdom, energy, and right ideas. </p>
<p id="an7.64:24.1">An astute person should cut out <br/>this unskillful thing. <br/>And they’d train in the teaching in just the same way, <br/>not yielding to sulkiness. </p>
<p id="an7.64:25.1">Free of anger, free of despair, <br/>free of greed, with no more longing, <br/>tamed, having given up anger, <br/>the undefiled become fully extinguished. </p>

<p id="an7.66:1.5">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="an7.66:2.1">“Mendicants, conditions are impermanent. Conditions are unstable. Conditions are unreliable. This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an7.66:3.1">Sineru, the king of mountains, is 84,000 leagues long and 84,000 leagues wide. It sinks 84,000 leagues below the ocean and rises 84,000 leagues above it. There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, the rain doesn’t fall. For many years, many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands of years no rain falls. When this happens, the plants and seeds, the herbs, grass, and big trees wither away and dry up, and are no more. So impermanent are conditions, so unstable, so unreliable. This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an7.66:4.1">There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a second sun appears. When this happens, the streams and pools wither away and dry up, and are no more. So impermanent are conditions … </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an7.66:5.1">There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a third sun appears. When this happens, the great rivers—the Ganges, Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, and Mahī—wither away and dry up, and are no more. So impermanent are conditions … </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an7.66:6.1">There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a fourth sun appears. When this happens, the great lakes from which the rivers originate—the Anotattā, Sīhapapātā, Rathakārā, Kaṇṇamuṇḍā, Kuṇālā, Chaddantā, and Mandākinī—wither away and dry up, and are no more. So impermanent are conditions … </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an7.66:7.1">There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a fifth sun appears. When this happens, the water in the ocean sinks by a hundred leagues. It sinks by two, three, four, five, six, or even seven hundred leagues. The water that remains in the ocean is only seven palm trees deep. It’s six, five, four, three, two, or even one palm tree deep. The water that remains in the ocean is only seven fathoms deep. It’s six, five, four, three, two, one or even half a fathom deep. It’s waist high, knee high, or even ankle high. It’s like the time after the rainy season, when the rain falls heavily and water remains here and there in the cows’ hoofprints. In the same way, water in the ocean remains here and there in puddles like cows’ hoofprints. When the fifth sun appears there’s not even enough water in the great ocean to wet a toe-joint. So impermanent are conditions … </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an7.66:8.1">There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a sixth sun appears. When this happens, this great earth and Sineru the king of mountains smoke and smolder and give off fumes. It’s like when a potter’s kiln is first kindled, and it smokes and smolders and gives off fumes. In the same way, this great earth and Sineru the king of mountains smoke and smolder and give off fumes. So impermanent are conditions … </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an7.66:9.1">There comes a time when, after a very long period has passed, a seventh sun appears. When this happens, this great earth and Sineru the king of mountains erupt in one burning mass of fire. And as they blaze and burn the flames are swept by the wind as far as the Brahmā realm. Sineru the king of mountains blazes and burns, crumbling as it’s overcome by the great fire. And meanwhile, mountain peaks a hundred leagues high, or two, three, four, or five hundred leagues high disintegrate as they burn. And when the great earth and Sineru the king of mountains blaze and burn, no soot or ash is found. It’s like when ghee or oil blaze and burn, and neither ashes nor soot are found. In the same way, when the great earth and Sineru the king of mountains blaze and burn, no soot or ash is found. So impermanent are conditions, so unstable are conditions, so unreliable are conditions. This is quite enough for you to become disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding all conditions. </p>
<p id="an7.66:10.1">Mendicants, who would ever think or believe that this earth and Sineru, king of mountains, will burn and crumble and be no more, except for one who has seen the truth? </p>
<p id="an7.66:11.1">Once upon a time, there was a teacher called Sunetta. He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire. He had many hundreds of disciples. He taught them the path to rebirth in the company of Brahmā. Those who totally understood Sunetta’s teachings were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a good place, the company of Brahmā. Of those who didn’t totally understand Sunetta’s teachings, some—when their body broke up, after death—were reborn in the company of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others. Some were reborn in the company of the Gods Who Love to Create, some with the Joyful Gods, some with the Gods of Yāma, some with the Gods of the Thirty-Three, and some with the Gods of the Four Great Kings. Some were reborn in the company of well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders. </p>
<p id="an7.66:12.1">Then the teacher Sunetta thought: ‘It’s not proper for me to be reborn in the next life in exactly the same place as my disciples. Why don’t I further develop love?’ </p>
<p id="an7.66:13.1">Then Sunetta developed love for seven years. Having done so he did not return to this world for seven eons of cosmic expansion and contraction. As the cosmos contracted he went to the realm of streaming radiance. As it expanded he was reborn in an empty mansion of Brahmā. There he was Brahmā, the Great Brahmā, the vanquisher, the unvanquished, the universal seer, the wielder of power. He was Sakka, lord of gods, thirty-six times. Many hundreds of times he was a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extended to all four sides, he achieved stability in the country, and he possessed the seven treasures. He had over a thousand sons who were valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigned by principle, without rod or sword. Yet even though Sunetta lived so long, he was not exempt from rebirth, old age, and death. He was not exempt from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress, I say. </p>
<p id="an7.66:14.1">Why is that? Because of not understanding and not penetrating four things. What four? Noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom. These noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom have been understood and comprehended. Craving for continued existence has been cut off; the conduit to rebirth is ended; now there’ll be no more future lives.” </p>
<p id="an7.66:14.6">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an7.66:15.1">“Ethics, immersion, and wisdom, <br/>and the supreme freedom: <br/>these things have been understood <br/>by Gotama the renowned. </p>
<p id="an7.66:16.1">And so the Buddha, having insight, <br/>explained this teaching to the mendicants. <br/>The Teacher has made an end of suffering; <br/>seeing clearly, he is extinguished.” </p>

<p id="an7.67:1.1">“Mendicants, when a king’s frontier citadel is well provided with seven essentials and gets four kinds of sustenance when needed, without trouble or difficulty, it is then called a king’s frontier citadel that cannot be overrun by external foes and enemies. </p>
<p id="an7.67:2.1">With what seven essentials is a citadel well provided? </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an7.67:2.2">Firstly, a citadel has a pillar with deep foundations, firmly embedded, imperturbable and unshakable. This is the first essential with which a king’s frontier citadel is well provided, to defend those within and repel those outside. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an7.67:3.1">Furthermore, a citadel has a moat that is deep and wide. This is the second essential … </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an7.67:4.1">Furthermore, a citadel has a patrol path that is high and wide. This is the third essential … </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an7.67:5.1">Furthermore, a citadel has stores of many weapons, both projectile and hand-held. This is the fourth essential … </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an7.67:6.1">Furthermore, many kinds of armed forces reside in a citadel, such as elephant riders, cavalry, charioteers, archers, bannermen, adjutants, food servers, warrior-chiefs, princes, chargers, great warriors, heroes, leather-clad soldiers, and sons of bondservants. This is the fifth essential … </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an7.67:7.1">Furthermore, a citadel has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and intelligent. He keeps strangers out and lets known people in. This is the sixth essential … </p>
<p id="an7.67:8.1">Furthermore, a citadel has a wall that’s high and wide, covered with plaster. This is the seventh essential with which a king’s frontier citadel is well provided, to defend those within and repel those outside. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an7.67:8.3">With these seven essentials a citadel is well provided. </p>
<p id="an7.67:9.1">What are the four kinds of sustenance it gets when needed, without trouble or difficulty? </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an7.67:9.2">Firstly, a king’s frontier citadel has much hay, wood, and water stored up for the enjoyment, relief, and comfort of those within and to repel those outside. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an7.67:10.1">Furthermore, a king’s frontier citadel has much rice and barley stored up for those within. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an7.67:11.1">Furthermore, a king’s frontier citadel has much food such as sesame, green gram, and black gram stored up for those within. </p>
<p id="an7.67:12.1">Furthermore, a king’s frontier citadel has much medicine—ghee, butter, oil, honey, molasses, and salt—stored up for the enjoyment, relief, and comfort of those within and to repel those outside. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an7.67:12.3">These are the four kinds of sustenance it gets when needed, without trouble or difficulty. </p>
<p id="an7.67:13.1">When a king’s frontier citadel is well provided with seven essentials and gets four kinds of sustenance when needed, without trouble or difficulty, it is then called a king’s frontier citadel that cannot be overrun by external foes and enemies. In the same way, when a noble disciple has seven good qualities, and they get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty, they are then called a noble disciple who cannot be overrun by Māra, who cannot be overrun by the Wicked One. What are the seven good qualities that they have? </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an7.67:14.1">Just as a king’s frontier citadel has a pillar with deep foundations, firmly embedded, imperturbable and unshakable, to defend those within and repel those outside, in the same way a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ A noble disciple with faith as their pillar gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful, they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless, and they keep themselves pure. This is the first good quality they have. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an7.67:15.1">Just as a citadel has a moat that is deep and wide, in the same way a noble disciple has a conscience. They’re conscientious about bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and conscientious about having any bad, unskillful qualities. A noble disciple with a conscience as their moat gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful, they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless, and they keep themselves pure. This is the second good quality they have. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an7.67:16.1">Just as a citadel has a patrol path that is high and wide, in the same way a noble disciple is prudent. They’re prudent when it comes to bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and prudent when it comes to acquiring any bad, unskillful qualities. A noble disciple with prudence as their patrol path gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful, they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless, and they keep themselves pure. This is the third good quality they have. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an7.67:17.1">Just as a citadel has stores of many weapons, both projectile and hand-held, in the same way a noble disciple is very learned. They remember and keep what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reciting them, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically. A noble disciple with learning as their weapon gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful, they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless, and they keep themselves pure. This is the fourth good quality they have. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an7.67:18.1">Just as many kinds of armed forces reside in a citadel … in the same way a noble disciple is energetic. They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. A noble disciple with energy as their armed forces gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful, they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless, and they keep themselves pure. This is the fifth good quality they have. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an7.67:19.1">Just as a citadel has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and intelligent, who keeps strangers out and lets known people in, in the same way a noble disciple is mindful. They have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember and recall what was said and done long ago. A noble disciple with mindfulness as their gatekeeper gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful, they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless, and they keep themselves pure. This is the sixth good quality they have. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an7.67:20.1">Just as a citadel has a wall that’s high and wide, covered with plaster, to defend those within and repel those outside, in the same way a noble disciple is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. A noble disciple with wisdom as their wall gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful, they give up the blameworthy and develop the blameless, and they keep themselves pure. This is the seventh good quality they have. These are the seven good qualities that they have. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an7.67:21.1">And what are the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—that they get when they want, without trouble or difficulty? Just as a king’s frontier citadel has much hay, wood, and water stored up for the enjoyment, relief, and comfort of those within and to repel those outside, in the same way a noble disciple, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. This is for their own enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an7.67:22.1">Just as a king’s frontier citadel has much rice and barley stored up, in the same way, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a noble disciple enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. This is for their own enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an7.67:23.1">Just as a king’s frontier citadel has much food such as sesame, green gram, and black gram stored up, in the same way with the fading away of rapture, a noble disciple enters and remains in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ This is for their own enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an7.67:24.1">Just as a king’s frontier citadel has much medicine—ghee, butter, oil, honey, molasses, and salt—stored up for the enjoyment, relief, and comfort of those within and to repel those outside, in the same way, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a noble disciple enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.

<p id="an7.68:1.1">“A mendicant with seven qualities is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of veneration with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world. What seven? It’s when a mendicant knows the teachings, knows the meaning, has self-knowledge, knows moderation, knows the right time, knows assemblies, and knows people high and low. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an7.68:2.1">And how is a mendicant one who knows the teachings? It’s when a mendicant knows the teachings: statements, mixed prose & verse, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and classifications. If a mendicant did not know these teachings, they would not be called ‘one who knows the teachings’. But because they do know these teachings, they are called ‘one who knows the teachings’. Such is the one who knows the teachings. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an7.68:3.1">And how are they one who knows the meaning? It’s when a mendicant knows the meaning of this or that statement: ‘This is what that statement means; that is what this statement means.’ If a mendicant did not know the meaning of this or that statement, they would not be called ‘one who knows the meaning’. But because they do know the meaning of this or that statement, they are called ‘one who knows the meaning’. Such is the one who knows the teachings and the one who knows the meaning. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an7.68:4.1">And how are they one who has self-knowledge? It’s when a mendicant has self-knowledge: ‘This is the extent of my faith, ethics, learning, generosity, wisdom, and eloquence.’ If a mendicant did not have self-knowledge, they would not be called ‘one who has self-knowledge’. But because they do have self-knowledge, they are called ‘one who has self-knowledge’. Such is the one who knows the teachings, the one who knows the meaning, and the one who has self-knowledge. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an7.68:5.1">And how are they one who knows moderation?

The person who does like to see the noble ones is praiseworthy in that respect. </p>

<p id="an7.69:16.1">Hearing the cry of the Earth Gods, the Gods of the Four Great Kings … the Gods of the Thirty-Three … the Gods of Yama … the Joyful Gods … the Gods Who Love to Create … the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others … the Gods of Brahmā’s Host raise the cry: ‘This venerable named so-and-so, from such-and-such village or town, the pupil of the venerable named so-and-so, went forth from the lay life to homelessness. They’ve realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ And so at that moment, in that instant, the cry soars up to the Brahmā realm. Such is the majesty of a mendicant who has ended the defilements.” </p>

<p id="an7.70:1.1">Then as Venerable Sāriputta was in private retreat this thought came to his mind, “What should a mendicant honor and respect and rely on, to give up the unskillful and develop the skillful?” </p>
<p id="an7.70:1.3">Then he thought, “A mendicant should honor and respect and rely on the Teacher … the teaching … the Saṅgha … the training … immersion … diligence … A mendicant should honor and respect and rely on hospitality, to give up the unskillful and develop the skillful.” </p>
<p id="an7.70:2.1">Then he thought, “These qualities are pure and bright in me. Why don’t I go and tell them to the Buddha? Then these qualities will not only be purified in me, but will be better known as purified. Suppose a man were to acquire a gold coin, pure and bright. They’d think, ‘My gold coin is pure and bright. Why don’t I take it to show the smiths? Then it will not only be purified, but will be better known as purified.’ In the same way, these qualities are pure and bright in me. Why don’t I go and tell them to the Buddha? Then these qualities will not only be purified in me, but will be better known as purified.” </p>
<p id="an7.70:3.1">Then in the late afternoon, Sāriputta came out of retreat and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down to one side, and told the Buddha of his thoughts while on retreat. </p>
<p id="an7.70:5.1">“Good, good, Sāriputta! A mendicant should honor and respect and rely on the Teacher, to give up the unskillful and develop the skillful.

<p id="an7.73:1.1">“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a Teacher called Sunetta. He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire. He had many hundreds of disciples. He taught them the path to rebirth in the company of Brahmā. Those lacking confidence in Sunetta were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. Those full of confidence in Sunetta were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. </p>
<p id="an7.73:2.1">Once upon a time there was a teacher called Mūgapakkha … Aranemi … Kuddālaka … Hatthipāla … Jotipāla … Araka. He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire.

Those full of confidence in Araka were—when their body broke up, after death—reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. </p>
<p id="an7.73:3.1">What do you think, mendicants? If someone with malicious intent were to abuse and insult these seven teachers with their hundreds of followers, would they not make much bad karma?” </p>
<p id="an7.73:3.3">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an7.73:3.4">“They would indeed. But someone who abuses and insults a single person accomplished in view with malicious intent makes even more bad karma. Why is that? I say that any injury done by those outside of the Buddhist community does not compare with what is done to one’s own spiritual companions. </p>

<p id="an7.74:1.1">“Once upon a time, mendicants, there was a Teacher called Araka. He was a religious founder and was free of sensual desire. He had many hundreds of disciples, and he taught them like this: ‘Brahmins, life as a human is short, brief, and fleeting, full of suffering and distress. Be thoughtful and wake up! Do what’s good and lead the spiritual life, for no-one born can escape death. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an7.74:2.1">It’s like a drop of dew on a grass tip. When the sun comes up it quickly evaporates and doesn’t last long. In the same way, life as a human is like a dewdrop. It’s brief and fleeting, full of suffering and distress. Be thoughtful and wake up! Do what’s good and lead the spiritual life, for no-one born can escape death. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an7.74:3.1">It’s like when the rain falls heavily. The bubbles quickly vanish and don’t last long. In the same way, life as a human is like a bubble. … </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an7.74:4.1">It’s like a line drawn in water. It vanishes quickly and doesn’t last long. In the same way, life as a human is like a line drawn in water. … </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an7.74:5.1">It’s like a mountain river traveling far, flowing fast, carrying all before it. It doesn’t turn back—not for a moment, a second, an instant—but runs, rolls, and flows on. In the same way, life as a human is like a mountain river. … </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an7.74:6.1">It’s like a strong man who has formed a glob of spit on the tip of his tongue. He could easily spit it out. In the same way, life as a human is like a glob of spit. … </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an7.74:7.1">Suppose there was an iron cauldron that had been heated all day. If you tossed a scrap of meat in, it would quickly vanish and not last long. In the same way, life as a human is like a scrap of meat. … </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an7.74:8.1">It’s like a cow being led to the slaughterhouse. With every step she comes closer to the slaughter, closer to death. In the same way, life as a human is like a cow being slaughtered. It’s brief and fleeting, full of suffering and distress. Be thoughtful and wake up! Do what’s good and lead the spiritual life, for no-one born can escape death.’ </p>
<p id="an7.74:9.1">Now, mendicants, at that time human beings had a life span of 60,000 years. Girls could be married at 500 years of age. And human beings only had six afflictions: cold, heat, hunger, thirst, and the need to defecate and urinate. But even though humans were so long-lived with so few afflictions, Araka still taught in this way: ‘Life as a human is short, brief, and fleeting, full of suffering and distress. Be thoughtful and wake up! Do what’s good and lead the spiritual life, for no-one born can escape death.’ </p>
<p id="an7.74:10.1">These days it’d be right to say: ‘Life as a human is short, brief, and fleeting, full of suffering and distress. Be thoughtful and wake up! Do what’s good and lead the spiritual life, for no-one born can escape death.’ For these days a long life is a hundred years or a little more. Living for a hundred years, there are just three hundred seasons, a hundred each of the winter, summer, and rains. Living for three hundred seasons, there are just twelve hundred months, four hundred in each of the winter, summer, and rains. Living for twelve hundred months, there are just twenty-four hundred fortnights, eight hundred in each of the winter, summer, and rains. Living for 2,400 fortnights, there are just 36,000 days, 12,000 in each of the summer, winter, and rains. Living for 36,000 days, you just eat 72,000 meals, 24,000 in each of the summer, winter, and rains, including when you’re suckling at the breast, and when you’re prevented from eating. </p>
<p id="an7.74:11.1">Things that prevent you from eating include anger, pain, sickness, sabbath, or being unable to get food. So mendicants, for a human being with a hundred years life span I have counted the life span, the limit of the life span, the seasons, the years, the months, the fortnights, the nights, the days, the meals, and the things that prevent them from eating. Out of compassion, I’ve done what a teacher should do who wants what’s best for their disciples. Here are these roots of trees, and here are these empty huts. Practice absorption, mendicants! Don’t be negligent! Don’t regret it later! This is my instruction to you.” </p>

<p id="an8.1:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>
<p id="an8.1:1.5">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="an8.1:2.1">“Mendicants, you can expect eight benefits when the heart’s release by love has been cultivated, developed, and practiced, made a vehicle and a basis, kept up, consolidated, and properly implemented. What eight? You sleep at ease. You wake happily. You don’t have bad dreams. Humans love you. Non-humans love you. Deities protect you. You can’t be harmed by fire, poison, or blade. If you don’t reach any higher, you’ll be reborn in a Brahmā realm. You can expect these eight benefits when the heart’s release by love has been cultivated, developed, and practiced, made a vehicle and a basis, kept up, consolidated, and properly implemented. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an8.1:3.1">A mindful one who develops <br/>limitless love <br/>weakens the fetters, <br/>seeing the ending of attachments. </p>
<p id="an8.1:4.1">Loving just one creature with a hateless heart <br/>makes you a true person. <br/>Compassionate for all creatures, <br/>a noble one creates abundant merit. </p>
<p id="an8.1:5.1">The royal potentates conquered this land <br/>and traveled around sponsoring sacrifices—<br/>horse sacrifice, human sacrifice, <br/>the sacrifices of the ‘casting of the yoke-pin’, <j>the ‘royal soma drinking’, and the ‘unbarred’. </j></p>
<p id="an8.1:6.1">These are not worth a sixteenth part <br/>of the mind developed with love, <br/>as all the constellations of stars <br/>aren’t worth a sixteenth part of the moon’s light. </p>
<p id="an8.1:7.1">Don’t kill or cause others to kill, <br/>don’t conquer or encourage others to conquer, <br/>with love for all sentient beings, <br/>you’ll have no enmity for anyone.” </p>

<p id="an8.2:1.1">“Mendicants, there are eight causes and reasons that lead to acquiring the wisdom fundamental to the spiritual life, and to its increase, growth, and full development once it has been acquired. What eight? </p>
<p id="an8.2:1.3">It’s when a mendicant lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role. And they set up a keen sense of conscience and prudence for them, with warmth and respect. This is the first cause. </p>
<p id="an8.2:2.1">When a mendicant lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role—with a keen sense of conscience and prudence for them, with warmth and respect—from time to time they go and ask them questions: ‘Why, sir, does it say this? What does that mean?’ Those venerables clarify what is unclear, reveal what is obscure, and dispel doubt regarding the many doubtful matters. This is the second cause. </p>
<p id="an8.2:3.1">After hearing that teaching they perfect withdrawal of both body and mind. This is the third cause. </p>
<p id="an8.2:4.1">A mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. This is the fourth cause. </p>
<p id="an8.2:5.1">They’re very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically. This is the fifth cause. </p>
<p id="an8.2:6.1">They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. This is the sixth cause. </p>
<p id="an8.2:7.1">When in the Saṅgha they don’t engage in motley talk or low talk. Either they talk on Dhamma, or they invite someone else to do so, or they respect noble silence. This is the seventh cause. </p>
<p id="an8.2:8.1">They meditate observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates. ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling. Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is the ending of perception. Such are choices, such is the origin of choices, such is the ending of choices. Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ This is the eighth cause. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an8.2:9.1">Their spiritual companions esteem them: ‘This venerable lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role. They set up a keen sense of conscience and prudence for them, with warmth and respect. Clearly this venerable knows and sees.’ This quality leads to fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an8.2:10.1">‘This venerable lives relying on the Teacher or a spiritual companion in a teacher’s role, and from time to time they go and ask them questions … Clearly this venerable knows and sees.’ This quality also leads to fondness, respect, esteem, harmony, and unity. </p>

<p id="an8.6:2.1">An unlearned ordinary person encounters gain and loss, fame and disgrace, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain. And so does a learned noble disciple. What, then, is the difference between a learned noble disciple and an ordinary unlearned person?” </p>

<p id="an8.6:3.1">“Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>

<p id="an8.6:3.4">“Mendicants, an unlearned ordinary person encounters gain. They don’t reflect: ‘I’ve encountered this gain.

They don’t reflect: ‘I’ve encountered this pain. It’s impermanent, suffering, and perishable.’ They don’t truly understand it. </p>
<p id="an8.6:4.1">So gain and loss, fame and disgrace, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain occupy their mind. They favor gain and oppose loss. They favor fame and oppose disgrace. They favor praise and oppose blame. They favor pleasure and oppose pain. Being so full of favoring and opposing, they’re not freed from rebirth, old age, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. They’re not freed from suffering, I say. </p>

<p id="an8.8:1.1">At one time Venerable Uttara was staying on the Saṅkheyyaka Mountain in the Mahisa region near Dhavajālikā. There Uttara addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, it’s good for a mendicant to check their own failings from time to time. It’s good for a mendicant to check the failings of others from time to time. It’s good for a mendicant to check their own successes from time to time. It’s good for a mendicant to check the successes of others from time to time.” </p>
<p id="an8.8:2.1">Now at that time the great king Vessavaṇa was on his way from the north to the south on some business. He heard Venerable Uttara teaching this to the mendicants on Saṅkheyyaka Mountain. </p>
<p id="an8.8:3.1">Then Vessavaṇa vanished from Saṅkheyyaka Mountain and appeared among the gods of the Thirty-Three, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm. Then he went up to Sakka, lord of gods, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an8.8:3.3">“Please sir, you should know this. Venerable Uttara is teaching the mendicants on Saṅkheyyaka Mountain in this way: ‘It’s good for a mendicant from time to time to check their own failings. … the failings of others … their own successes … the successes of others.’” </p>
<p id="an8.8:4.1">Then, as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, Sakka vanished from the gods of the Thirty-Three and reappeared on Saṅkheyyaka Mountain in front of Venerable Uttara. Then Sakka went up to Venerable Uttara, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an8.8:5.1">“Is it really true, sir, that you teach the mendicants in this way: ‘It’s good for a mendicant from time to time to check their own failings … the failings of others … their own successes … the successes of others’?” </p>
<p id="an8.8:5.6">“Indeed, lord of gods.” </p>
<p id="an8.8:5.7">“Sir, did this teaching come to you from your own inspiration, or was it spoken by the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha?” </p>
<p id="an8.8:5.8">“Well then, lord of gods, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said. </p>
<p id="an8.8:6.1">Suppose there was a large heap of grain not far from a town or village. And a large crowd were to take away grain with carrying poles, baskets, hip sacks, or their cupped hands. If someone were to go to that crowd and ask them where they got the grain from, how should that crowd rightly reply?” </p>
<p id="an8.8:6.6">“Sir, they should reply that they took it from the large heap of grain.” </p>
<p id="an8.8:6.7">“In the same way, lord of gods, whatever is well spoken is spoken by the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. Both myself and others rely completely on that when we speak.” </p>
<p id="an8.8:7.1">“It’s incredible, sir, it’s amazing! How well this was said by Venerable Uttara! ‘Whatever is well spoken is spoken by the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. Both myself and others rely completely on that when we speak.’ At one time, Honorable Uttara, the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain, not long after Devadatta had left. There the Buddha spoke to the mendicants about Devadatta: </p>
<p id="an8.8:8.1">‘Mendicants, it’s good for a mendicant from time to time to check their own failings … the failings of others … their own successes … the successes of others.

<p id="an8.8:13.1">Honorable Uttara, this exposition of the teaching is not established anywhere in the four assemblies—monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen. Sir, learn this exposition of the teaching! Memorize this exposition of the teaching! Remember this exposition of the teaching! Sir, this exposition of the teaching is beneficial and relates to the fundamentals of the spiritual life.” </p>

<p id="an8.9:1.1">“Mendicants, you could rightly call Nanda ‘Gentleman’, ‘strong’, ‘lovely’, and ‘lustful’. How could he live the full and pure spiritual life unless he guards the sense doors, eats in moderation, is dedicated to wakefulness, and has mindfulness and situational awareness? </p>
<p id="an8.9:1.6">This is how Nanda guards the sense doors. If he has to look to the east, he wholeheartedly concentrates before looking, thinking: ‘When I look to the east, bad, unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure will not overwhelm me.’ In this way he’s aware of the situation. </p>
<p id="an8.9:2.1">If he has to look to the west … north … south … up … down … If he has to survey the intermediate directions, he wholeheartedly concentrates before looking, thinking: ‘When I survey the intermediate directions, bad, unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure will not overwhelm me.’ In this way he’s aware of the situation. This is how Nanda guards the sense doors. </p>
<p id="an8.9:3.1">This is how Nanda eats in moderation. Nanda reflects rationally on the food he eats: ‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’ This is how Nanda eats in moderation. </p>
<p id="an8.9:4.1">This is how Nanda is committed to wakefulness. Nanda practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying his mind from obstacles. In the evening, he continues to practice walking and sitting meditation. In the middle of the night, he lies down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. In the last part of the night, he gets up and continues to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying his mind from obstacles. This is how Nanda is committed to wakefulness. </p>
<p id="an8.9:5.1">This is how Nanda has mindfulness and situational awareness. Nanda knows feelings as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. He knows perceptions as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. He knows thoughts as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. This is how Nanda has mindfulness and situational awareness. </p>

<p id="an8.10:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. Now at that time the mendicants accused a mendicant of an offense.

<p id="an8.10:3.1">Suppose in a growing field of barley some bad barley appeared, just useless trash. Its roots, stem, and leaves would look just the same as the healthy barley. That is, so long as the head doesn’t appear. But when the head appears, they know that it’s bad barley, just useless trash. When they realize this they pull it up by the roots and throw it outside the field. Why is that? So that it doesn’t spoil the good barley. </p>
<p id="an8.10:4.1">In the same way, take a case where a certain person looks just the same as other good-natured mendicants when going out and coming back, when looking ahead and aside, when bending and extending the limbs, and when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes.

<p id="an8.10:5.1">Suppose that a large heap of grain is being winnowed. The grains that are firm and substantial form a heap on one side. And the grains that are flimsy and insubstantial are blown over to the other side. Then the owners take a broom and sweep them even further away. Why is that? So that it doesn’t spoil the good grain.

The trees that were firm and substantial made a cracking sound. But the trees that were rotten inside, decomposing and decayed, made a thud. He’d cut down such a tree at the root, lop off the crown, and thoroughly clear out the insides. Then he’d use it as an irrigation gutter for the well. In the same way, take a case where a certain person looks just the same as other good-natured mendicants when going out and coming back, when looking ahead and aside, when bending and extending the limbs, and when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes.

When they realize this they send him away. Why is that? So that he doesn’t corrupt good-natured mendicants. </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an8.10:7.1">By living together, know that <br/>they’re irritable, with corrupt wishes, <br/>offensive, stubborn, and contemptuous, <br/>jealous, stingy, and devious. </p>

<p id="an8.11:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying in Verañja at the root of a neem tree dedicated to Naḷeru. Then the brahmin Verañja went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="an8.11:2.1">“Master Gotama, I have heard that the ascetic Gotama doesn’t bow to old brahmins, the elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat. And this is indeed the case, for Master Gotama does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat. This is not appropriate, Master Gotama.” </p>
<p id="an8.11:2.6">“Brahmin, I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—for whom I should bow down or rise up or offer a seat. If the Realized One bowed down or rose up or offered a seat to anyone, their head would explode!” </p>
<p id="an8.11:3.1">“Master Gotama lacks taste.” </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an8.11:3.2">“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I lack taste. For the Realized One has given up taste for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. It’s cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. In this sense you could rightly say that I lack taste. But that’s not what you’re talking about.” </p>
<p id="an8.11:4.1">“Master Gotama is indelicate.” </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an8.11:4.2">“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I’m indelicate. For the Realized One has given up delight in sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. It’s cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. In this sense you could rightly say that I’m indelicate. But that’s not what you’re talking about.” </p>
<p id="an8.11:5.1">“Master Gotama is a teacher of inaction.” </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an8.11:5.2">“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I’m a teacher of inaction. For I teach inaction regarding bad bodily, verbal, and mental conduct, and the many kinds of unskillful things. In this sense you could rightly say that I’m a teacher of inaction. But that’s not what you’re talking about.” </p>
<p id="an8.11:6.1">“Master Gotama is a teacher of annihilationism.” </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an8.11:6.2">“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I’m a teacher of annihilationism. For I teach the annihilation of greed, hate, and delusion, and the many kinds of unskillful things. In this sense you could rightly say that I’m a teacher of annihilationism. But that’s not what you’re talking about.” </p>
<p id="an8.11:7.1">“Master Gotama is disgusted.” </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an8.11:7.2">“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I’m disgusted. For I’m disgusted by bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and by attainment of the many kinds of unskillful things. In this sense you could rightly say that I’m disgusted. But that’s not what you’re talking about.” </p>
<p id="an8.11:8.1">“Master Gotama is an exterminator.” </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an8.11:8.2">“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I’m an exterminator. For I teach the extermination of greed, hate, and delusion, and the many kinds of unskillful things. In this sense you could rightly say that I’m an exterminator. But that’s not what you’re talking about.” </p>
<p id="an8.11:9.1">“Master Gotama is a mortifier.” </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an8.11:9.2">“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I’m a mortifier. For I say that bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind should be mortified. I say that a mortifier is someone who has given up unskillful qualities that should be mortified. They’ve cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they’re unable to arise in the future. The Realized One is someone who has given up unskillful qualities that should be mortified. He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they’re unable to arise in the future. In this sense you could rightly say that I’m a mortifier. But that’s not what you’re talking about.” </p>
<p id="an8.11:10.1">“Master Gotama is an abortionist.” </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="an8.11:10.2">“There is, brahmin, a sense in which you could rightly say that I’m an abortionist. I say that an abortionist is someone who has given up future wombs and rebirth into a new state of existence. They’ve cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they’re unable to arise in the future. The Realized One has given up future wombs and rebirth into a new state of existence. He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they’re unable to arise in the future. In this sense you could rightly say that I’m an abortionist. But that’s not what you’re talking about. </p>
<p id="an8.11:11.1">Suppose, brahmin, there was a chicken with eight or ten or twelve eggs. And she properly sat on them to keep them warm and incubated. Now, the chick that is first to break out of the eggshell with its claws and beak and hatch safely: should that be called the eldest or the youngest?” </p>
<p id="an8.11:11.4">“Master, Gotama, that should be called the eldest. For it is the eldest among them.” </p>
<p id="an8.11:12.1">“In the same way, in this population lost in ignorance, trapped in their shells, I alone have broken open the egg of ignorance and realized the supreme perfect awakening. So, brahmin, I am the eldest and the first in the world. </p>
<p id="an8.11:13.1">My energy was roused up and unflagging, my mindfulness was established and lucid, my body was tranquil and undisturbed, and my mind was immersed in samādhi. Quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected were stilled, I entered and remained in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, I entered and remained in the third absorption, where I meditated with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ With the giving up of pleasure and pain, and the ending of former happiness and sadness, I entered and remained in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. </p>
<p id="an8.11:14.1">When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward recollection of past lives. I recollected many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. I remembered: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so I recollected my many kinds of past lives, with features and details. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an8.11:15.1">This was the first knowledge, which I achieved in the first watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute. This was my first breaking out, like a chick breaking out of the eggshell. </p>
<p id="an8.11:16.1">When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings. With clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds: ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, I saw sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. I understood how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an8.11:17.1">This was the second knowledge, which I achieved in the middle watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute. This was my second breaking out, like a chick breaking out of the eggshell. </p>
<p id="an8.11:18.1">When my mind had immersed in samādhi like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—I extended it toward knowledge of the ending of defilements. I truly understood: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. I truly understood: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’. Knowing and seeing like this, my mind was freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. When it was freed, I knew it was freed. </p>
<p id="an8.11:18.6">I understood: ‘Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.’ </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an8.11:19.1">This was the third knowledge, which I achieved in the last watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed and knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed and light arose, as happens for a meditator who is diligent, keen, and resolute. This was my third breaking out, like a chick breaking out of the eggshell.” </p>
<p id="an8.11:20.1">When he said this, the brahmin Verañja said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="an8.11:20.2">“Master Gotama is the eldest! Master Gotama is the best! Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with clear eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<p id="an8.12:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Now at that time several very prominent Licchavis were sitting together at the town hall, praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways. </p>
<p id="an8.12:2.1">Now at that time General Sīha, a disciple of the Jains, was sitting in that assembly. He thought, “That Blessed One must without a doubt be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha. For several very prominent Licchavis are praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways. Why don’t I go to see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!” </p>
<p id="an8.12:2.5">Then General Sīha went to the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan and said to him, “Sir, I’d like to go to see the ascetic Gotama.” </p>
<p id="an8.12:3.1">“But Sīha, you believe in the doctrine of action. Why should you go to see the ascetic Gotama, who teaches a doctrine of inaction? For the ascetic Gotama believes in a doctrine of inaction, he teaches inaction, and he guides his disciples in that way.” </p>
<p id="an8.12:3.3">Then Sīha’s determination to go and see the Buddha died down. </p>
<p id="an8.12:4.1">For a second time, several prominent Licchavis were sitting together at the town hall, praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways. And for a second time Sīha thought: “Why don’t I go to see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!” </p>
<p id="an8.12:4.5">Then General Sīha went to the Jain Ñātika … </p>
<p id="an8.12:5.3">Then for a second time Sīha’s determination to go and see the Buddha died down. </p>
<p id="an8.12:6.1">For a third time, several prominent Licchavis were sitting together at the town hall, praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways. And for a third time Sīha thought, “That Blessed One must without a doubt be a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha. For several very prominent Licchavis are praising the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha in many ways. What can these Jains do to me, whether I take leave of them or not? Why don’t I, without taking leave of them, go to see that Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha!” </p>
<p id="an8.12:7.1">Then Sīha, with around five hundred chariots, set out from Vesālī in the middle of the day to see the Buddha. He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and went by foot. Then General Sīha went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an8.12:8.1">“Sir, I have heard this: ‘The ascetic Gotama believes in a doctrine of inaction, he teaches inaction, and he guides his disciples in that way.’ I trust those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and do not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism? For we don’t want to misrepresent the Blessed One.” </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an8.12:9.1">“There is, Sīha, a sense in which you could rightly say that I believe in inaction, I teach inaction, and I guide my disciples in that way. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an8.12:10.1">And there is a sense in which you could rightly say that I believe in action, I teach action, and I guide my disciples in that way. </p>

I say that bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind should be mortified. I say that a mortifier is someone who has given up unskillful qualities that should be mortified. They’ve cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they’re unable to arise in the future. The Realized One is someone who has given up unskillful qualities that should be mortified. He has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so that they’re unable to arise in the future. In this sense you could rightly say that I’m a mortifier. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an8.12:23.1">And what’s the sense in which you could rightly say that I’m an abortionist, I teach abortion, and I guide my disciples in that way?

I’m ambitious to offer solace, the highest solace, I teach solace, and I guide my disciples in that way. In this sense you could rightly say that I’m ambitious.” </p>
<p id="an8.12:25.1">When he said this, General Sīha said to the Buddha, “Excellent, sir! Excellent! From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>
<p id="an8.12:26.1">“Sīha, you should act after careful consideration. It’s good for well-known people such as yourself to act after careful consideration.” </p>
<p id="an8.12:26.2">“Now I’m even more delighted and satisfied with the Buddha, since he tells me to act after careful consideration. For if the followers of other religions were to gain me as a disciple, they’d carry a banner all over Vesālī, saying: ‘General Sīha has become our disciple!’ And yet the Buddha tells me to act after careful consideration. For a second time, I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>
<p id="an8.12:27.1">“For a long time now, Sīha, your family has been a well-spring of support for the Jain ascetics. You should consider giving to them when they come.” </p>
<p id="an8.12:27.2">“Now I’m even more delighted and satisfied with the Buddha, since he tells me to consider giving to the Jain ascetics when they come. Sir, I have heard this: ‘The ascetic Gotama says, “Gifts should only be given to me, and to my disciples. Only what is given to me is very fruitful, not what is given to others. Only what is given to my disciples is very fruitful, not what is given to the disciples of others.”’ Yet the Buddha encourages me to give to the Jain ascetics. Well, sir, we’ll know the proper time for that. For a third time, I go for refuge to the Buddha, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>
<p id="an8.12:28.1">Then the Buddha taught Sīha step by step, with a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation. And when the Buddha knew that Sīha’s mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in General Sīha: “Everything that has a beginning has an end.” </p>
<p id="an8.12:29.1">Then Sīha saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma. He went beyond doubt, got rid of indecision, and became self-assured and independent of others regarding the Teacher’s instructions. He said to the Buddha, “Sir, may the Buddha together with the mendicant Saṅgha please accept tomorrow’s meal from me.” The Buddha consented with silence. Then, knowing that the Buddha had consented, Sīha got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. </p>
<p id="an8.12:30.1">Then Sīha addressed a certain man, “Mister, please find out if there is any meat ready for sale.” And when the night had passed General Sīha had delicious fresh and cooked foods prepared in his own home. Then he had the Buddha informed of the time, saying, “Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.” </p>
<p id="an8.12:31.1">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to Sīha’s home, where he sat on the seat spread out, together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Now at that time many Jain ascetics in Vesālī went from street to street and from square to square, calling out with raised arms: “Today General Sīha has slaughtered a fat calf for the ascetic Gotama’s meal. The ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared specially for him: this is a deed he caused.” </p>
<p id="an8.12:32.1">Then a certain person went up to Sīha and whispered in his ear, “Please sir, you should know this. Many Jain ascetics in Vesālī are going from street to street and square to square, calling out with raised arms: ‘Today General Sīha has slaughtered a fat calf for the ascetic Gotama’s meal. The ascetic Gotama knowingly eats meat prepared specially for him: this is a deed he caused.’” </p>
<p id="an8.12:32.6">“Enough, sir. For a long time those venerables have wanted to discredit the Buddha, his teaching, and his Saṅgha. They’ll never stop misrepresenting the Buddha with their false, hollow, lying, untruthful claims. We would never deliberately take the life of a living creature, not even for life’s sake.” </p>
<p id="an8.12:33.1">Then Sīha served and satisfied the mendicant Saṅgha headed by the Buddha with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods. When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, Sīha sat down to one side. Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired him with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat and left. </p>

<p id="an8.21:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, you should remember the householder Ugga of Vesālī as someone who has eight amazing and incredible qualities.” </p>
<p id="an8.21:1.4">That is what the Buddha said. When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. </p>
<p id="an8.21:2.1">Then a certain mendicant robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the householder Ugga of Vesālī, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Ugga of Vesālī went up to that mendicant, bowed, and sat down to one side. The mendicant said to him: </p>
<p id="an8.21:3.1">“Householder, the Buddha declared that you have eight amazing and incredible qualities. What are the eight qualities that he spoke of?” </p>
<p id="an8.21:3.3">“Sir, I don’t know what eight amazing and incredible qualities the Buddha was referring to. But these eight amazing and incredible qualities are found in me. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="an8.21:3.7">“Yes, householder,” replied the mendicant. Ugga of Vesālī said this: </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an8.21:3.9">“Sir, when I first saw the Buddha off in the distance, my heart was inspired as soon as I saw him. This is the first incredible and amazing quality found in me. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an8.21:4.1">With confident heart I paid homage to the Buddha. The Buddha taught me step by step, with a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation.

<p id="an8.22:1.4">That is what the Buddha said. When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. </p>
<p id="an8.22:2.1">Then a certain mendicant robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the householder Ugga of Elephant Village, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then Ugga of Elephant Village went up to that mendicant, bowed, and sat down to one side. The mendicant said to him: </p>
<p id="an8.22:2.3">“Householder, the Buddha declared that you have eight amazing and incredible qualities. What are the eight qualities that he spoke of?” </p>
<p id="an8.22:3.1">“Sir, I don’t know what eight amazing and incredible qualities the Buddha was referring to. But these eight amazing and incredible qualities are found in me. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="an8.22:3.5">“Yes, householder,” replied the mendicant. Ugga of Elephant Village said this: </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an8.22:3.7">“Sir, when I first saw the Buddha off in the distance I was partying in the Dragon’s Park. My heart was inspired as soon as I saw him, and I sobered up. This is the first incredible and amazing quality found in me. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an8.22:4.1">With confident heart I paid homage to the Buddha. The Buddha taught me step by step, with a talk on giving, ethical conduct, and heaven. He explained the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, so sordid and corrupt, and the benefit of renunciation. And when he knew that my mind was ready, pliable, rid of hindrances, elated, and confident he explained the special teaching of the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth rid of stains would properly absorb dye, in that very seat the stainless, immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in me: ‘Everything that has a beginning has an end.’ I saw, attained, understood, and fathomed the Dhamma.

That one is freed by wisdom. That one is a personal witness. That one is attained to view. That one is freed by faith. That one is a follower of teachings. That one is a follower by faith. That one is ethical, of good character. That one is unethical, of bad character.’ But while I’m serving the Saṅgha I don’t recall thinking: ‘Let me give this one just a little, and that one a lot.’ Rather, I give impartially.

<p id="an8.24:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Āḷavī, at the Aggāḷava Tree-shrine. Then the householder Hatthaka of Āḷavī, escorted by around five hundred lay followers, went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to Hatthaka: </p>
<p id="an8.24:1.3">“Hatthaka, you have a large congregation. How do you bring together such a large congregation?” </p>
<p id="an8.24:1.5">“Sir, I bring together such a large congregation by using the four ways of being inclusive as taught by the Buddha. When I know that a person can be included by a gift, I include them by giving a gift. When I know that a person can be included by kindly words, I include them by kindly words. When I know that a person can be included by taking care of them, I include them by caring for them. When I know that a person can be included by equality, I include them by treating them equally. But also, sir, my family is wealthy. They wouldn’t think that a poor person was worth listening to in the same way.” </p>
<p id="an8.24:1.16">“Good, good, Hatthaka! This is the right way to bring together a large congregation. Whether in the past, future, or present, all those who have brought together a large congregation have done so by using these four ways of being inclusive.” </p>
<p id="an8.24:2.1">Then the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired Hatthaka of Āḷavī with a Dhamma talk, after which he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha before leaving. Then, not long after Hatthaka had left, the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, you should remember the householder Hatthaka of Āḷavī as someone who has eight amazing and incredible qualities.

<p id="an8.30:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Bhaggas at Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood. And at that time Venerable Anuruddha was staying in the land of the Cetīs in the Eastern Bamboo Park. Then as Anuruddha was in private retreat this thought came to his mind: </p>
<p id="an8.30:1.4">“This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes. It’s for the contented, not those who lack contentment. It’s for the secluded, not those who enjoy company. It’s for the energetic, not the lazy. It’s for the mindful, not the unmindful. It’s for those with immersion, not those without immersion. It’s for the wise, not the witless.” </p>
<p id="an8.30:2.1">Then the Buddha knew what Anuruddha was thinking. As easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, he vanished from the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood in the land of the Bhaggas and reappeared in front of Anuruddha in the Eastern Bamboo Park in the land of the Cetīs, and sat on the seat spread out. Anuruddha bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: </p>
<p id="an8.30:3.1">“Good, good, Anuruddha! It’s good that you reflect on these thoughts of a great man: ‘This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes. It’s for the contented, not those who lack contentment. It’s for the secluded, not those who enjoy company. It’s for the energetic, not the lazy. It’s for the mindful, not the unmindful. It’s for those with immersion, not those without immersion. It’s for the wise, not the witless.’ Well then, Anuruddha, you should also reflect on the following eighth thought of a great man: ‘This teaching is for those who don’t enjoy proliferating and don’t like to proliferate, not for those who enjoy proliferating and like to proliferate.’ </p>
<p id="an8.30:4.1">First you’ll reflect on these eight thoughts of a great man. Then whenever you want, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, you’ll enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. </p>
<p id="an8.30:5.1">You’ll enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. </p>
<p id="an8.30:6.1">You’ll enter and remain in the third absorption, where you’ll meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ </p>
<p id="an8.30:7.1">Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, you’ll enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. </p>
<p id="an8.30:8.1">First you’ll reflect on these eight thoughts of a great man, and you’ll get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when you want, without trouble or difficulty. Then as you live contented your rag robe will seem to you like a chest full of garments of different colors seems to a householder or householder’s child. It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment. </p>
<p id="an8.30:9.1">As you live contented your scraps of almsfood will seem to you like boiled fine rice with the dark grains picked out, served with many soups and sauces seems to a householder or householder’s child. It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment. </p>
<p id="an8.30:10.1">As you live contented your lodging at the root of a tree will seem to you like a bungalow, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with latches fastened and windows shuttered seems to a householder or householder’s child. It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment. </p>
<p id="an8.30:11.1">As you live contented your lodging at the root of a tree will seem to you like a couch spread with woolen covers—shag-piled, pure white, or embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide, with a canopy above and red pillows at both ends seems to a householder or householder’s child. It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment. </p>
<p id="an8.30:12.1">As you live contented your fermented urine as medicine will seem to you like various medicines—ghee, butter, oil, honey, and molasses—seem to a householder or householder’s child. It will be for your enjoyment, relief, and comfort, and for alighting upon extinguishment. Well then, Anuruddha, for the next rainy season residence you should stay right here in the land of the Cetīs in the Eastern Bamboo Park.” </p>
<p id="an8.30:12.4">“Yes, sir,” Anuruddha replied. </p>
<p id="an8.30:13.1">After advising Anuruddha like this, the Buddha—as easily as a strong person would extend or contract their arm, vanished from the Eastern Bamboo Park in the land of the Cetīs and reappeared in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood in the land of the Bhaggas. He sat on the seat spread out and addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, I will teach you the eight thoughts of a great man. Listen … </p>
<p id="an8.30:13.5">And what are the eight thoughts of a great man? This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes. It’s for the contented, not those who lack contentment. It’s for the secluded, not those who enjoy company. It’s for the energetic, not the lazy. It’s for the mindful, not the unmindful. It’s for those with immersion, not those without immersion. It’s for the wise, not the witless. It’s for those who don’t enjoy proliferating and don’t like to proliferate, not for those who enjoy proliferating and like to proliferate. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an8.30:14.1">‘This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? A mendicant with few wishes doesn’t wish: ‘May they know me as having few wishes!’ When contented, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as contented!’ When secluded, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as secluded!’ When energetic, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as energetic!’ When mindful, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as mindful!’ When immersed, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as immersed!’ When wise, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as wise!’ When not enjoying proliferation, they don’t wish: ‘May they know me as one who doesn’t enjoy proliferating!’ ‘This teaching is for those of few wishes, not those of many wishes.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an8.30:15.1">‘This teaching is for the contented, not those who lack contentment.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? It’s for a mendicant who’s content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. ‘This teaching is for the contented, not those who lack contentment.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an8.30:16.1">‘This teaching is for the secluded, not those who enjoy company.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? It’s for a mendicant who lives secluded. But monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, rulers and their ministers, monastics of other religions and their disciples go to visit them. With a mind slanting, sloping, and inclining to seclusion, withdrawn, and loving renunciation, that mendicant invariably gives each of them a talk emphasizing the topic of dismissal. ‘This teaching is for the secluded, not those who enjoy company.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an8.30:17.1">‘This teaching is for the energetic, not the lazy.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? It’s for a mendicant who lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. ‘This teaching is for the energetic, not the lazy.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an8.30:18.1">‘This teaching is for the mindful, not the unmindful.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? It’s for a mendicant who’s mindful. They have utmost mindfulness and alertness, and can remember and recall what was said and done long ago. ‘This teaching is for the mindful, not the unmindful.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an8.30:19.1">‘This teaching is for those with immersion, not those without immersion.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? It’s for a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. ‘This teaching is for those with immersion, not those without immersion.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an8.30:20.1">‘This teaching is for the wise, not the witless.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? It’s for a mendicant who’s wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. ‘This teaching is for the wise, not the witless.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="an8.30:21.1">‘This teaching is for those who don’t enjoy proliferating and don’t like to proliferate, not for those who enjoy proliferating and like to proliferate.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? It’s for a mendicant whose mind is secure, confident, settled, and decided regarding the cessation of proliferation. ‘This teaching is for those who don’t enjoy proliferating and don’t like to proliferate, not for those who enjoy proliferating and like to proliferate.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.” </p>
<p id="an8.30:22.1">Then Anuruddha stayed the next rainy season residence right there in the land of the Cetīs in the Eastern Bamboo Park. And Anuruddha, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="an8.30:22.3">He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable Anuruddha became one of the perfected. And on the occasion of attaining perfection he recited these verses: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an8.30:23.1">“Knowing my thoughts, <br/>the supreme Teacher in the world <br/>came to me in a mind-made body, <br/>using his psychic power. </p>
<p id="an8.30:24.1">He taught me more <br/>than I had thought of. <br/>The Buddha who loves non-proliferation <br/>taught me non-proliferation. </p>
<p id="an8.30:25.1">Understanding that teaching, <br/>I happily did his bidding. <br/>I’ve attained the three knowledges, <br/>and have fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.” </p>

<p data-counter="1" id="an8.35:1.3">First, someone gives to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. Whatever they give they expect back. They see a well-to-do aristocrat or brahmin or householder amusing themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. It occurs to them: ‘If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders!’ They settle on that idea, concentrate on it and develop it. As they’ve settled for less and not developed further, their idea leads to rebirth there.

<p data-counter="1" id="an8.41:2.1">“Mendicants, the observance of the sabbath with its eight factors is very fruitful and beneficial and splendid and bountiful. And how should it be observed? It’s when a noble disciple reflects: ‘As long as they live, the perfected ones give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They are scrupulous and kind, and live full of compassion for all living beings. I, too, for this day and night will give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. I’ll be scrupulous and kind, and live full of compassion for all living beings. I will observe the sabbath by doing as the perfected ones do in this respect.’ This is its first factor. </p>

<p id="an8.46:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery. </p>
<p id="an8.46:1.2">Now at that time Venerable Anuruddha had gone into retreat for the day’s meditation. Then several deities of the Lovable Host went up to Venerable Anuruddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an8.46:1.4">“Honorable Anuruddha, we are the deities called ‘Lovable’. We wield authority and control over three things. We can turn any color we want on the spot. We can get any voice that we want on the spot. We can get any pleasure that we want on the spot. We are the deities called ‘Lovable’. We wield authority and control over these three things.” </p>
<p id="an8.46:2.1">Then Venerable Anuruddha thought, “If only these deities would all turn blue, of blue color, clad in blue, adorned with blue!” Then those deities, knowing Anuruddha’s thought, all turned blue. </p>
<p id="an8.46:3.1">Then Venerable Anuruddha thought, “If only these deities would all turn yellow …” </p>
<p id="an8.46:3.3">“If only these gods would all turn red …” </p>
<p id="an8.46:3.4">“If only these gods would all turn white …” Then those deities, knowing Anuruddha’s thought, all turned white. </p>
<p id="an8.46:4.1">Then one of those deities sang, one danced, and one snapped her fingers. Suppose there was a quintet made up of skilled musicians who had practiced well and kept excellent rhythm. They’d sound graceful, tantalizing, sensuous, lovely, and intoxicating. In the same way the performance by those deities sounded graceful, tantalizing, sensuous, lovely, and intoxicating. But Venerable Anuruddha averted his senses. </p>
<p id="an8.46:5.1">Then those deities, thinking “Master Anuruddha isn’t enjoying this,” vanished right there. Then in the late afternoon, Anuruddha came out of retreat and went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, adding: </p>
<p id="an8.46:9.1">“How many qualities do females have so that—when their body breaks up, after death—they are reborn in company with the Gods of the Lovable Host?” </p>
<p id="an8.46:10.1">“Anuruddha, when they have eight qualities females—when their body breaks up, after death—are reborn in company with the Gods of the Lovable Host. What eight? </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an8.46:10.3">Take the case of a female whose mother and father give her to a husband wanting what’s best for her, out of kindness and compassion. She would get up before him and go to bed after him, and be obliging, behaving nicely and speaking politely. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an8.46:11.1">She honors, respects, esteems, and venerates those her husband respects, such as mother and father, and ascetics and brahmins. And when they arrive she serves them with a seat and water. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an8.46:12.1">She’s deft and tireless in her husband’s household duties, such as knitting and sewing. She understands how to go about things in order to complete and organize the work. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an8.46:13.1">She knows what work her husband’s domestic bondservants, employees, and workers have completed, and what they’ve left incomplete. She knows who is sick, and who is fit or unwell. She distributes to each a fair portion of fresh and cooked foods. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an8.46:14.1">She ensures that any income her husband earns is guarded and protected, whether money, grain, silver, or gold. She doesn’t overspend, steal, waste, or lose it. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an8.46:15.1">She’s a lay follower who has gone for refuge to the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an8.46:16.1">She’s ethical. She doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or use alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="an8.46:17.1">She’s generous. She lives at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share. </p>

<p id="an8.51:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an8.51:1.3">“Sir, please let females gain the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.” </p>
<p id="an8.51:1.4">“Enough, Gotamī. Don’t endorse the going forth for females from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.” </p>
<p id="an8.51:2.1">For a second time … </p>

<p id="an8.51:3.3">“Enough, Gotamī. Don’t endorse the going forth for females from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.” </p>
<p id="an8.51:4.1">Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī thought, “The Buddha does not permit females to go forth.” Miserable and sad, weeping, with a tearful face, she bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on her right, before leaving. </p>
<p id="an8.51:5.1">When the Buddha had stayed in Kapilavatthu as long as he pleased, he set out for Vesālī. Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Vesālī, where he stayed at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī had her hair shaved, and dressed in ocher robes. Together with several Sakyan ladies she set out for Vesālī. Traveling stage by stage, she arrived at Vesālī and went to the Great Wood, the hall with the peaked roof. Then Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī stood crying outside the gate, her feet swollen, her limbs covered with dust, miserable and sad, with tearful face. </p>
<p id="an8.51:6.1">Venerable Ānanda saw her standing there, and said to her, “Gotamī, why do you stand crying outside the gate, your feet swollen, your limbs covered with dust, miserable and sad, with tearful face?” </p>
<p id="an8.51:6.4">“Honorable Ānanda, it’s because the Buddha does not permit females to go forth in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.” </p>
<p id="an8.51:6.5">“Well then, Gotamī, wait here just a moment, while I ask the Buddha to grant the going forth for females.” </p>
<p id="an8.51:7.1">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an8.51:7.2">“Sir, Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī is standing crying outside the gate, her feet swollen, her limbs covered with dust, miserable and sad, with tearful face.

<p id="an8.51:8.4">“Enough, Ānanda. Don’t endorse the going forth for females from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.” </p>
<p id="an8.51:9.1">Then Venerable Ānanda thought, “The Buddha does not permit females to go forth. Why don’t I try another approach?” </p>
<p id="an8.51:9.4">Then Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha, “Sir, is a female able to realize the fruits of stream-entry, once-return, non-return, and perfection once she has gone forth?” </p>
<p id="an8.51:9.6">“She is able, Ānanda.” </p>
<p id="an8.51:9.7">“If a female is able to realize the fruits of stream-entry, once-return, non-return, and perfection once she has gone forth. Sir, Mahāpajāpatī has been very helpful to the Buddha. She is his aunt who raised him, nurtured him, and gave him her milk. When the Buddha’s birth mother passed away, she nurtured him at her own breast. Sir, please let females gain the going forth from the lay life to homelessness in the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One.” </p>
<p id="an8.51:10.1">“Ānanda, if Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī accepts these eight principles of respect, that will be her ordination. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an8.51:11.1">A nun, even if she has been ordained for a hundred years, should bow down to a monk who was ordained that very day.

<p data-counter="4" id="an8.51:14.1">After completing the rainy season residence the nuns should invite admonition from the communities of both monks and nuns in regard to anything that was seen, heard, or suspected.

<p data-counter="5" id="an8.51:15.1">A nun who has committed a grave offense should undergo penance in the communities of both monks and nuns for a fortnight. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an8.51:16.1">A trainee nun who has trained in the six rules for two years should seek ordination from the communities of both monks and nuns. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an8.51:17.1">A nun should not abuse or insult a monk in any way. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts. </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="an8.51:18.1">From this day forth it is forbidden for nuns to criticize monks, but it is not forbidden for monks to criticize nuns. This principle should be honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated, and not transgressed so long as life lasts. </p>
<p id="an8.51:19.1">If Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī accepts these eight principles of respect, that will be her ordination.” </p>
<p id="an8.51:20.1">Then Ānanda, having learned these eight principles of respect from the Buddha himself, went to Mahāpajāpatī Gotamī and said: </p>
<p id="an8.51:21.1">“Gotamī, if you accept eight principles of respect, that will be your ordination. </p>
<p id="an8.51:22.1">A nun, even if she has been ordained for a hundred years, should bow down to a monk who was ordained that very day.

<p id="an8.63:11.2">Then that mendicant, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life.

The Realized One has developed and cultivated the four bases of psychic power, made them a vehicle and a basis, kept them up, consolidated them, and properly implemented them.

May the Holy One please remain for the eon! That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.” For his mind was as if possessed by Māra. </p>
<p id="an8.70:5.1">Then the Buddha said to Venerable Ānanda, “Go now, Ānanda, at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="an8.70:5.3">“Yes, sir,” replied Ānanda. He rose from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before sitting at the root of a tree close by. </p>
<p id="an8.70:5.4">And then, not long after Ānanda had left, Māra the Wicked said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="an8.70:6.1">“Sir, may the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. </p>
<p id="an8.70:6.2">Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I shall not become fully extinguished until I have monk disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned, have memorized the teachings, and practice in line with the teachings; not until they practice appropriately, living in line with the teaching; not until they’ve learned their tradition, and explain, teach, assert, establish, clarify, analyze, and reveal; not until they can legitimately and completely refute the doctrines of others that come up, and teach with a demonstrable basis.’ Today you do have such monk disciples. </p>
<p id="an8.70:7.1">May the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One now become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. </p>
<p id="an8.70:7.2">Sir, you once made this statement: ‘Wicked One, I shall not become fully extinguished until I have nun disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ … </p>
<p id="an8.70:7.4">‘Wicked One, I shall not become fully extinguished until I have layman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ … </p>
<p id="an8.70:7.5">‘Wicked One, I shall not become fully extinguished until I have laywoman disciples who are competent, educated, assured, learned …’ … Today you do have such laywoman disciples. </p>
<p id="an8.70:8.1">Sir, may the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished. Sir, you once made this statement: </p>
<p id="an8.70:8.3">‘Wicked One, I shall not become fully extinguished until my spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans.’ Today your spiritual path is successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, and well proclaimed wherever there are gods and humans. </p>
<p id="an8.70:9.1">Sir, may the Blessed One now become fully extinguished! May the Holy One become fully extinguished! Now is the time for the Buddha to become fully extinguished.” </p>
<p id="an8.70:9.2">“Relax, Wicked One. The final extinguishment of the Realized One will be soon. Three months from now the Realized One will finally be extinguished.” </p>
<p id="an8.70:10.1">So at the Cāpāla Tree-shrine the Buddha, mindful and aware, surrendered the life force. When he did so there was a great earthquake, awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky. Then, understanding this matter, on that occasion the Buddha expressed this heartfelt sentiment: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an8.70:10.4">“Comparing the incomparable <j>with the creation of prolonged life, </j><br/>the sage surrendered the life force. <br/>Happy inside, serene, <br/>he shattered self-creation like a suit of armor.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="an8.70:11.1">Then Venerable Ānanda thought, “That was a really big earthquake! That was really a very big earthquake; awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky! What’s the cause, what’s the reason for a great earthquake?” </p>
<p id="an8.70:13.1">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, that was a really big earthquake! That was really a very big earthquake; awe-inspiring and hair-raising, and thunder cracked the sky! What’s the cause, what’s the reason for a great earthquake?” </p>
<p id="an8.70:14.1">“Ānanda, there are these eight causes and reasons for a great earthquake. What eight? </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an8.70:14.3">This great earth is grounded on water, the water is grounded on air, and the air stands in space. At a time when a great wind blows, it stirs the water, and the water stirs the earth. This is the first cause and reason for a great earthquake. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an8.70:15.1">Furthermore, there is an ascetic or brahmin with psychic power who has achieved mastery of the mind, or a god who is mighty and powerful. They’ve developed a limited perception of earth and a limitless perception of water. They make the earth shake and rock and tremble. This is the second cause and reason for a great earthquake. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an8.70:16.1">Furthermore, when the being intent on awakening passes away from the host of Joyful Gods, he’s conceived in his mother’s belly, mindful and aware. Then the earth shakes and rocks and trembles. This is the third cause and reason for a great earthquake. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an8.70:17.1">Furthermore, when the being intent on awakening comes out of his mother’s belly mindful and aware, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles. This is the fourth cause and reason for a great earthquake. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an8.70:18.1">Furthermore, when the Realized One realizes the supreme perfect awakening, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles. This is the fifth cause and reason for a great earthquake. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an8.70:19.1">Furthermore, when the Realized One rolls forth the supreme Wheel of Dhamma, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles. This is the sixth cause and reason for a great earthquake. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an8.70:20.1">Furthermore, when the Realized One, mindful and aware, surrenders the life force, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles. This is the seventh cause and reason for a great earthquake. </p>
<p id="an8.70:21.1">Furthermore, when the Realized One becomes fully extinguished in the element of extinguishment with nothing left over, the earth shakes and rocks and trembles. This is the eighth cause and reason for a great earthquake. </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="an8.70:21.3">These are the eight causes and reasons for a great earthquake.” </p>

<p id="an8.73:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying at Ñātika in the brick house. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>
<p id="an8.73:1.4">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="an8.73:1.6">“Mendicants, when mindfulness of death is developed and cultivated it’s very fruitful and beneficial. It culminates in the deathless and ends with the deathless. But do you develop mindfulness of death?” </p>
<p id="an8.73:2.1">When he said this, one of the mendicants said to the Buddha, “Sir, I develop mindfulness of death.” </p>

<p id="an8.76:1.1">“Mendicants, there are these eight accomplishments. What eight? Accomplishment in initiative, protection, good friendship, and balanced finances. And accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an8.76:1.4">And what is accomplishment in initiative? It’s when a gentleman earns a living by means such as farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or one of the professions. He understands how to go about these things in order to complete and organize the work. This is called accomplishment in initiative. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an8.76:2.1">And what is accomplishment in protection? It’s when a gentleman owns legitimate wealth that he has earned by his own efforts and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow. He ensures it is guarded and protected, thinking: ‘How can I prevent my wealth from being taken by rulers or bandits, consumed by fire, swept away by flood, or taken by unloved heirs?’ This is called accomplishment in protection. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an8.76:3.1">And what is accomplishment in good friendship? It’s when a gentleman resides in a town or village. And in that place there are householders or their children who may be young or old, but are mature in conduct, accomplished in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom. He associates with them, converses and engages in discussion. And he emulates the same kind of accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom. This is called accomplishment in good friendship. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an8.76:4.1">And what is accomplishment in balanced finances? It’s when a gentleman, knowing his income and expenditure, balances his finances, being neither too extravagant nor too frugal. He thinks, ‘In this way my income will exceed my expenditure, not the reverse.’ It’s like an appraiser or their apprentice who, holding up the scales, knows that it’s low by this much or high by this much. In the same way, a gentleman, knowing his income and expenditure, balances his finances, being neither too extravagant nor too frugal. He thinks, ‘In this way my income will exceed my expenditure, not the reverse.’ If a gentleman has little income but an opulent life, people will say: ‘This gentleman eats their wealth like a fig-eater!’ If a gentleman has a large income but a spartan life, people will say: ‘This gentleman is starving themselves to death!’ But a gentleman, knowing his income and expenditure, leads a balanced life, neither too extravagant nor too frugal, thinking, ‘In this way my income will exceed my expenditure, not the reverse.’ This is called accomplishment in balanced finances. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an8.76:5.1">And what is accomplishment in faith? It’s when a gentleman has faith in the Realized One’s awakening: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha … teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ This is called accomplishment in faith. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an8.76:6.1">And what is accomplishment in ethics? It’s when a gentleman doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or consume alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. This is called accomplishment in ethics. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an8.76:7.1">And what is accomplishment in generosity? It’s when a gentleman lives at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share. This is called accomplishment in generosity. </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="an8.76:8.1">And what is accomplishment in wisdom? It’s when a gentleman is wise. He has the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. This is called accomplishment in wisdom. </p>
<p id="an8.76:9.1">These are the eight accomplishments. </p>

<p id="an8.86:1.4">“It seems the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—has arrived at Icchānaṅgala. He is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ … It’s good to see such perfected ones.” </p>
<p id="an8.86:2.1">Then, when the night had passed, they took abundant fresh and cooked foods and went to the forest near Icchānaṅgala, where they stood outside the gates making a dreadful racket. </p>

<h4 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">AN 9.1</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">Awakening </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Sambodhisutta</span></h4>
<p id="an9.1:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: </p>
<p id="an9.1:2.1">“Mendicants, if wanderers of other religions were to ask: ‘Reverends, what is the vital condition for the development of the awakening factors?’ How would you answer them?” </p>
<p id="an9.1:2.3">“Our teachings are rooted in the Buddha. … The mendicants will listen and remember it.” </p>
<p id="an9.1:3.1">“Well then, mendicants, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="an9.1:3.2">“Yes, sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="an9.1:4.1">“Mendicants, if wanderers of other religions were to ask: ‘Reverends, what is the vital condition for the development of the awakening factors?’ You should answer them: </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an9.1:5.1">‘It’s when a mendicant has good friends, companions, and associates. This is the first vital condition for the development of the awakening factors. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an9.1:6.1">Furthermore, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. This is the second vital condition for the development of the awakening factors. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an9.1:7.1">Furthermore, a mendicant gets to take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart, when they want, without trouble or difficulty. That is, talk about fewness of wishes, contentment, seclusion, aloofness, arousing energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom. This is the third vital condition for the development of the awakening factors. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an9.1:8.1">Furthermore, a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. This is the fourth vital condition for the development of the awakening factors. </p>
<p id="an9.1:9.1">Furthermore, a mendicant is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. This is the fifth vital condition for the development of the awakening factors.’ </p>
<p id="an9.1:10.1">A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to be ethical … </p>
<p id="an9.1:11.1">A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart … </p>
<p id="an9.1:12.1">A mendicant with good friends, companions, and associates can expect to live with energy roused up … </p>

<p data-counter="6–9" id="an9.1:14.1">But then, a mendicant grounded on these five things should develop four further things. They should develop the perception of ugliness to give up greed, love to give up hate, mindfulness of breathing to cut off thinking, and perception of impermanence to uproot the conceit ‘I am’. When you perceive impermanence, the perception of not-self becomes stabilized. Perceiving not-self, you uproot the conceit ‘I am’ and attain extinguishment in this very life.” </p>

<p id="an9.2:1.1">Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an9.2:1.2">“Sir, they speak of being ‘supported’. How is a mendicant who is supported defined?” </p>
<p id="an9.2:1.4">“Mendicant, if a mendicant supported by faith gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful, the unskillful is actually given up by them. </p>
<p id="an9.2:1.5">If a mendicant supported by conscience … </p>
<p id="an9.2:1.6">If a mendicant supported by prudence … </p>
<p id="an9.2:1.7">If a mendicant supported by energy … </p>
<p id="an9.2:1.8">If a mendicant supported by wisdom gives up the unskillful and develops the skillful, the unskillful is actually given up by them. What’s been given up is completely given up when it has been given up by seeing with noble wisdom. </p>
<p id="an9.2:2.1">But then, a mendicant grounded on these five things should rely on four things. What four? After appraisal, a mendicant uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and gets rid of some things. That’s how a mendicant is supported.” </p>

<h4 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">AN 9.3</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">With Meghiya </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Meghiyasutta</span></h4>
<p id="an9.3:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Cālikā, on the Cālikā mountain. </p>
<p id="an9.3:1.2">Now, at that time Venerable Meghiya was the Buddha’s attendant. Then Venerable Meghiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, “Sir, I’d like to enter Jantu village for alms.” </p>
<p id="an9.3:1.5">“Please, Meghiya, go at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="an9.3:2.1">Then Meghiya robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Jantu village for alms. After the meal, on his return from almsround in Jantu village, he went to the shore of Kimikālā river. As he was going for a walk along the shore of the river he saw a lovely and delightful mango grove. </p>
<p id="an9.3:2.4">It occurred to him, “Oh, this mango grove is lovely and delightful! This is good enough for striving for a gentleman wanting to strive. If the Buddha allows me, I’ll come back to this mango grove to meditate.” </p>
<p id="an9.3:3.1">Then Venerable Meghiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened, adding, “If the Buddha allows me, I’ll go back to that mango grove to meditate.” </p>
<p id="an9.3:4.9">“We’re alone, Meghiya. Wait until another mendicant comes.” </p>
<p id="an9.3:5.1">For a second time Meghiya said to the Buddha, “Sir, the Buddha has nothing more to do, and nothing that needs improvement. But I have. If you allow me, I’ll go back to that mango grove to meditate.” </p>
<p id="an9.3:5.5">“We’re alone, Meghiya. Wait until another mendicant comes.” </p>
<p id="an9.3:6.1">For a third time Meghiya said to the Buddha, “Sir, the Buddha has nothing more to do, and nothing that needs improvement. But I have. If you allow me, I’ll go back to that mango grove to meditate.” </p>
<p id="an9.3:6.5">“Meghiya, since you speak of striving in meditation, what can I say? Please, Meghiya, go at your convenience.” </p>
<p id="an9.3:7.1">Then Meghiya got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went to that mango grove, and, having plunged deep into it, sat at the root of a certain tree for the day’s meditation. But while Meghiya was meditating in that mango grove he was beset mostly by three kinds of bad, unskillful thoughts, namely, sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts. </p>
<p id="an9.3:7.4">Then he thought, “Oh, how incredible, how amazing! I’ve gone forth from the lay life to homelessness out of faith, but I’m still harassed by these three kinds of bad, unskillful thoughts: sensual, malicious, and cruel thoughts.” </p>
<p id="an9.3:8.1">Then Venerable Meghiya went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. </p>
<p id="an9.3:10.1">“Meghiya, when the heart’s release is not ripe, five things help it ripen. What five? </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an9.3:10.3">Firstly, a mendicant has good friends, companions, and associates. This is the first thing … </p>

<h4 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">AN 9.4</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">With Nandaka </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Nandakasutta</span></h4>
<p id="an9.4:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>
<p id="an9.4:1.2">Now at that time Venerable Nandaka was educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the mendicants in the assembly hall with a Dhamma talk. Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall. He stood outside the door waiting for the talk to end. When he knew the talk had ended he cleared his throat and knocked with the latch. The mendicants opened the door for the Buddha, and he entered the assembly hall, where he sat on the seat spread out. </p>
<p id="an9.4:2.2">He said to Nandaka, “Nandaka, that was a long exposition of the teaching you gave to the mendicants. My back was aching while I stood outside the door waiting for the talk to end.” </p>
<p id="an9.4:3.1">When he said this, Nandaka felt embarrassed and said to the Buddha, “Sir, we didn’t know that the Buddha was standing outside the door. If we’d known, I wouldn’t have said so much.” </p>
<p id="an9.4:4.1">Then the Buddha, knowing that Nandaka was embarrassed, said to him, “Good, good, Nandaka! It’s appropriate for gentlemen like you, who have gone forth in faith from the lay life to homelessness, to sit together for a Dhamma talk. When you’re sitting together you should do one of two things: discuss the teachings or keep noble silence. </p>
<p id="an9.4:4.6">Nandaka, a mendicant is faithful but not ethical. So they’re incomplete in that respect, and should fulfill it, thinking, ‘How can I become faithful and ethical?’ When a mendicant is faithful and ethical, they’re complete in that respect. </p>
<p id="an9.4:5.1">A mendicant is faithful and ethical, but does not get internal serenity of heart. So they’re incomplete in that respect, and should fulfill it, thinking, ‘How can I become faithful and ethical and get internal serenity of heart?’ When a mendicant is faithful and ethical and gets internal serenity of heart, they’re complete in that respect. </p>
<p id="an9.4:6.1">A mendicant is faithful, ethical, and gets internal serenity of heart, but they don’t get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles. So they’re incomplete in that respect. Suppose, Nandaka, there was a four-footed animal that was lame and disabled. It would be incomplete in that respect. In the same way, a mendicant is faithful, ethical, and gets internal serenity of heart, but they don’t get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles. So they’re incomplete in that respect, and should fulfill it, thinking, ‘How can I become faithful and ethical and get internal serenity of heart and get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles?’ </p>
<p id="an9.4:7.1">When a mendicant is faithful and ethical and gets internal serenity of heart and gets the higher wisdom of discernment of principles, they’re complete in that respect.” </p>
<p id="an9.4:7.2">That is what the Buddha said. When he had spoken, the Holy One got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. </p>
<p id="an9.4:8.1">Then soon after the Buddha left, Venerable Nandaka said to the mendicants, “Just now, reverends, the Buddha explained a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure in four statements, before getting up from his seat and entering his dwelling: </p>
<p id="an9.4:8.3">‘Nandaka, a mendicant is faithful but not ethical. So they’re incomplete in that respect, and should fulfill it, thinking, “How can I become faithful and ethical?” When a mendicant is faithful and ethical, they’re complete in that respect. </p>
<p id="an9.4:8.8">A mendicant is faithful and ethical, but does not get internal serenity of heart. … </p>
<p id="an9.4:8.9">They get internal serenity of heart, but they don’t get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles. So they’re incomplete in that respect. Suppose, Nandaka, there was a four-footed animal that was lame and disabled. It would be incomplete in that respect. In the same way, a mendicant is faithful, ethical, and gets internal serenity of heart, but they don’t get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles. So they’re incomplete in that respect, and should fulfill it, thinking: “How can I become faithful and ethical and get internal serenity of heart and get the higher wisdom of discernment of principles?” When a mendicant is faithful and ethical and gets internal serenity of heart and gets the higher wisdom of discernment of principles, they’re complete in that respect.’ </p>
<p id="an9.4:9.1">Reverends, there are these five benefits of listening to the teachings at the right time and discussing the teachings at the right time. What five? </p>
<p id="an9.4:9.3">Firstly, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And they reveal a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. Whenever they do this, they become liked and approved by the Teacher, respected and admired. This is the first benefit … </p>
<p id="an9.4:10.1">Furthermore, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma … Whenever they do this, they feel inspired by the meaning and the teaching in that Dhamma. This is the second benefit … </p>
<p id="an9.4:11.1">Furthermore, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma … Whenever they do this, they see the meaning of a deep saying in that Dhamma with penetrating wisdom. This is the third benefit … </p>
<p id="an9.4:12.1">Furthermore, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma … Whenever they do this, their spiritual companions esteem them more highly, thinking, ‘For sure this venerable has attained or will attain.’ This is the fourth benefit … </p>
<p id="an9.4:13.1">Furthermore, a mendicant teaches the mendicants the Dhamma … Whenever they do this, there may be trainee mendicants present, who haven’t achieved their heart’s desire, but live aspiring to the supreme sanctuary from the yoke. Hearing that teaching, they rouse energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized. There may be perfected mendicants present, who have ended the defilements, completed the spiritual journey, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, achieved their own goal, utterly ended the fetters of rebirth, and are rightly freed through enlightenment. Hearing that teaching, they simply live happily in the present life. This is the fifth benefit … </p>
<p id="an9.4:13.5">These are the five benefits of listening to the teachings at the right time and discussing the teachings at the right time.” </p>

<h4 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">AN 9.5</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">Powers </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Balasutta</span></h4>
<p id="an9.5:1.1">“Mendicants, there are these four powers. What four? The powers of wisdom, energy, blamelessness, and inclusiveness. </p>
<p id="an9.5:1.4">And what is the power of wisdom? One has clearly seen and clearly contemplated with wisdom those qualities that are skillful and considered to be skillful; those that are unskillful … blameworthy … blameless … dark … bright … to be cultivated … not to be cultivated … not worthy of the noble ones … worthy of the noble ones and considered to be worthy of the noble ones. This is called the power of wisdom. </p>
<p id="an9.5:2.1">And what is the power of energy? One generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives to give up those qualities that are unskillful and considered to be unskillful; those that are blameworthy … dark … not to be cultivated … not worthy of the noble ones and considered to be not worthy of the noble ones. One generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives to gain those qualities that are skillful and considered to be skillful; those that are blameless … bright … to be cultivated … worthy of the noble ones and considered to be worthy of the noble ones. This is called the power of energy. </p>
<p id="an9.5:3.1">And what is the power of blamelessness? It’s when a noble disciple has blameless conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. This is called the power of blamelessness. </p>
<p id="an9.5:4.1">And what is the power of inclusiveness? There are these four ways of being inclusive. Giving, kindly words, taking care, and equality. The best of gifts is the gift of the teaching. The best sort of kindly speech is to teach the Dhamma again and again to someone who is engaged and who actively listens. The best way of taking care is to encourage, settle, and ground the unfaithful in faith, the unethical in ethics, the stingy in generosity, and the ignorant in wisdom. The best kind of equality is the equality of a stream-enterer with another stream-enterer, a once-returner with another once-returner, a non-returner with another non-returner, and a perfected one with another perfected one. This is called the power of inclusiveness. These are the four powers. </p>
<p id="an9.5:5.1">A noble disciple who has these four powers has got past five fears. What five? Fear regarding livelihood, disrepute, feeling insecure in an assembly, death, and bad rebirth. </p>
<p id="an9.5:5.4">Then that noble disciple reflects: ‘I have no fear regarding livelihood. Why would I be afraid of that? I have these four powers: the powers of wisdom, energy, blamelessness, and inclusiveness. A witless person might fear for their livelihood. A lazy person might fear for their livelihood. A person who does blameworthy things by way of body, speech, and mind might fear for their livelihood. A person who does not include others might fear for their livelihood. I have no fear of disrepute … I have no fear about feeling insecure in an assembly … I have no fear of death … I have no fear of a bad rebirth. Why would I be afraid of that? I have these four powers: the powers of wisdom, energy, blamelessness, and inclusiveness. A witless person might be afraid of a bad rebirth. A lazy person might be afraid of a bad rebirth. A person who does blameworthy things by way of body, speech, and mind might be afraid of a bad rebirth. A person who does not include others might be afraid of a bad rebirth.’ </p>
<p id="an9.5:5.24">A noble disciple who has these four powers has got past these five fears.” </p>

And the goal of the ascetic life for which I went forth from the lay life to homelessness is not being fully developed.’ In this case you should leave that person at that very time of the day or night, without asking. You shouldn’t follow them. </p>

<p id="an9.11:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>
<p id="an9.11:1.2">Then Venerable Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, I have completed the rainy season residence at Sāvatthī. I wish to depart to wander the countryside.” </p>
<p id="an9.11:1.5">“Please, Sāriputta, go at your convenience.” Then Sāriputta got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. </p>
<p id="an9.11:1.7">And then, not long after Sāriputta had left, a certain monk said to the Buddha, “Sir, Venerable Sāriputta attacked me and left without saying sorry.” </p>
<p id="an9.11:1.9">So the Buddha addressed a certain monk, “Please, monk, in my name tell Sāriputta that the teacher summons him.” </p>
<p id="an9.11:1.12">“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Sāriputta and said to him, “Reverend Sāriputta, the teacher summons you.” </p>
<p id="an9.11:1.14">“Yes, reverend,” Sāriputta replied. </p>
<p id="an9.11:2.1">Now at that time the venerables Mahāmoggallāna and Ānanda took a key and went from dwelling to dwelling, saying: “Come forth, venerables! Come forth, venerables! Now Venerable Sāriputta will roar his lion’s roar in the presence of the Buddha!” </p>
<p id="an9.11:2.4">Then Venerable Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: </p>
<p id="an9.11:2.5">“Sāriputta, one of your spiritual companions has made this complaint: ‘Venerable Sāriputta attacked me and left without saying sorry.’” </p>
<p id="an9.11:3.1">“Sir, someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an9.11:4.1">Suppose they were to toss both clean and unclean things on the earth, like feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood. The earth isn’t horrified, repelled, and disgusted because of this. In the same way, I live with a heart like the earth, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an9.11:5.1">Suppose they were to wash both clean and unclean things in water, like feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood. The water isn’t horrified, repelled, and disgusted because of this. In the same way, I live with a heart like water, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an9.11:6.1">Suppose a fire was to burn both clean and unclean things, like feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood.

Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an9.11:7.1">Suppose the wind was to blow on both clean and unclean things, like feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood.

<p data-counter="5" id="an9.11:8.1">Suppose a rag was to wipe up both clean and unclean things, like feces, urine, spit, pus, and blood. The rag isn’t horrified, repelled, and disgusted because of this. In the same way, I live with a heart like a rag, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an9.11:9.1">Suppose an outcaste boy or girl, holding a pot and clad in rags, were to enter a town or village. They’d enter with a humble mind. In the same way, I live with a heart like an outcaste boy or girl, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an9.11:10.1">Suppose there was a bull with his horns cut, gentle, well tamed and well trained. He’d wander from street to street and square to square without hurting anyone with his feet or horns. In the same way, I live with a heart like a bull with horns cut, abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry. </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="an9.11:11.1">Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and had bathed their head. If the carcass of a snake or a dog or a human were hung around their neck, they’d be horrified, repelled, and disgusted. In the same way, I’m horrified, repelled, and disgusted by this rotten body. Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry. </p>
<p data-counter="9" id="an9.11:12.1">Suppose someone was to carry around a bowl of fat that was leaking and oozing from holes and cracks. In the same way, I carry around this body that’s leaking and oozing from holes and cracks. Someone who had not established mindfulness of the body might well attack one of their spiritual companions and leave without saying sorry.” </p>
<p id="an9.11:13.1">Then that monk rose from his seat, placed his robe over one shoulder, bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said, “I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to speak ill of Venerable Sāriputta with a false, hollow, lying, untruthful claim. Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I will restrain myself in future.” </p>
<p id="an9.11:13.4">“Indeed, monk, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to act in that way. But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it. For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.” </p>
<p id="an9.11:14.1">Then the Buddha said to Venerable Sāriputta, “Sāriputta, forgive that silly man before his head explodes into seven pieces right here.” </p>
<p id="an9.11:14.3">“I will pardon that venerable if he asks me: ‘May the venerable please pardon me too.’” </p>

<p id="an9.12:1.2">Then Venerable Sāriputta robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then it occurred to him, “It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī. Why don’t I visit the monastery of the wanderers of other religions?” Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. </p>
<p id="an9.12:2.1">Now at that time while those wanderers of other religions were sitting together this discussion came up among them: </p>
<p id="an9.12:2.2">“Reverends, no-one who dies with something left over is exempt from hell, the animal realm, or the ghost realm. They’re not exempt from places of loss, bad places, the underworld.” </p>
<p id="an9.12:2.3">Sāriputta neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers of other religions. He got up from his seat, thinking, “I will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.” </p>
<p id="an9.12:2.6">Then Sāriputta wandered for alms in Sāvatthī. After the meal, on his return from almsround, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. </p>
<p id="an9.12:4.1">“Sāriputta, these foolish, incompetent wanderers following other religions: who are they to know whether someone has something left over or not? </p>

<p id="an9.20:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, “Householder, I wonder whether your family gives gifts?” </p>
<p id="an9.20:2.2">“It does, sir. But only coarse gruel with pickles.” </p>
<p id="an9.20:2.4">“Householder, someone might give a gift that’s either coarse or fine. But they give it carelessly, thoughtlessly, not with their own hand. They give the dregs, and they give without consideration for consequences. Then wherever the result of any such gift manifests, their mind doesn’t incline toward enjoyment of nice food, clothes, vehicles, or the five refined kinds of sensual stimulation. And their children, wives, bondservants, employees, and workers don’t want to listen to them. They don’t actively listen or try to understand. Why is that? Because that is the result of deeds done carelessly. </p>

And their children, wives, bondservants, employees, and workers want to listen. They actively listen and try to understand. Why is that? Because that is the result of deeds done carefully. </p>
<p id="an9.20:4.1">Once upon a time, householder, there was a brahmin named Velāma. He gave the following gift, a great offering. 84,000 gold bowls filled with silver. 84,000 silver bowls filled with gold. 84,000 bronze bowls filled with gold coins. 84,000 elephants with gold adornments and banners, covered with gold netting. 84,000 chariots upholstered with the hide of lions, tigers, and leopards, and cream rugs, with gold adornments and banners, covered with gold netting. 84,000 milk cows with silken reins and bronze pails. 84,000 maidens bedecked with jeweled earrings. 84,000 couches spread with woolen covers—shag-piled, pure white, or embroidered with flowers—and spread with a fine deer hide, with canopies above and red pillows at both ends. 8,400,000,000 fine cloths of linen, cotton, silk, and wool. And who can say how much food, drink, snacks, meals, refreshments, and beverages? It seemed like an overflowing river. </p>
<p id="an9.20:5.1">Householder, you might think: ‘Surely the brahmin Velāma must have been someone else at that time?’ But you should not see it like this. I myself was the brahmin Velāma at that time. I gave that gift, a great offering. But at that event there was no-one worthy of a religious donation, and no-one to purify the religious donation. </p>
<p id="an9.20:6.1">It would be more fruitful to feed one person accomplished in view than that great offering of Velāma. </p>

<p id="an9.26:1.1">So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. </p>
<p id="an9.26:1.3">There Venerable Candikāputta addressed the mendicants, “Reverends, Devadatta teaches the mendicants like this: ‘When a mendicant’s mind is solidified by heart, it’s appropriate for them to say: “I understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”’” </p>
<p id="an9.26:2.1">When he said this, Venerable Sāriputta said to him, “Reverend Candikāputta, Devadatta does not teach the mendicants like that. He teaches like this: ‘When a mendicant’s mind is well consolidated by heart, it’s appropriate for them to say: “I understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”’” </p>
<p id="an9.26:3.1">For a second time … </p>
<p id="an9.26:4.1">And for a third time Venerable Candikāputta addressed the mendicants … </p>
<p id="an9.26:4.5">And for a third time, Sāriputta said to him, “Reverend Candikāputta, Devadatta does not teach the mendicants like that. He teaches like this: ‘When a mendicant’s mind is well consolidated by heart, it’s appropriate for them to say: “I understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’”’ </p>
<p id="an9.26:5.1">And how is a mendicant’s mind well consolidated by heart? The mind is well consolidated by heart when they know: ‘My mind is without greed.’ … ‘My mind is without hate.’ … ‘My mind is without delusion.’ … ‘My mind is not liable to become greedy.’ … ‘My mind is not liable to become hateful.’ … ‘My mind is not liable to become deluded.’ … ‘My mind is not liable to return to rebirth in the sensual realm.’ … ‘My mind is not liable to return to rebirth in the realm of luminous form.’ … ‘My mind is not liable to return to rebirth in the formless realm.’ </p>
<p id="an9.26:5.11">When a mendicant’s mind is rightly freed like this, even if compelling sights come into the range of vision they don’t occupy their mind. The mind remains unaffected. It is steady, imperturbable, observing disappearance. </p>
<p id="an9.26:6.1">Suppose there was a stone pillar, sixteen feet long. Eight feet were buried underground, and eight above ground. And violent storms were to blow up out of the east, the west, the north, and the south. They couldn’t make it tremor and tremble and quake. Why is that? It’s because that stone pillar is firmly embedded, with deep foundations. In the same way, when a mendicant’s mind is rightly freed like this, even if compelling sights come into the range of vision they don’t occupy their mind. The mind remains unaffected. It is steady, imperturbable, observing disappearance. </p>

<p id="an9.35:1.1">“Mendicants, suppose there was a mountain cow who was foolish, incompetent, unskillful, and lacked common sense when roaming on rugged mountains. She might think, ‘Why don’t I go somewhere I’ve never been before? I could eat grass and drink water that I’ve never tried before.’ She’d take a step with a fore-hoof; but before it was properly set down, she’d lift up a hind-hoof. She wouldn’t go somewhere she’d never been before, or eat grass and drink water that she’d never tried before. And she’d never return safely to the place she had started from. Why is that? Because that mountain cow was foolish, incompetent, unskillful, and lacked common sense when roaming on rugged mountains. </p>
<p id="an9.35:1.10">In the same way, some foolish, incompetent, unskillful mendicant, lacking common sense, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. But they don’t cultivate, develop, and make much of that foundation; they don’t ensure it is properly stabilized. </p>

They think, ‘Why don’t I, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected.’ But they’re not able to enter and remain in the first absorption. This is called a mendicant who has slipped and fallen from both sides.

<p id="an9.36:1.1">“Mendicants, I say that the first absorption is a basis for ending the defilements. The second absorption is also a basis for ending the defilements.

They turn their mind away from those things, and apply it to the deathless: ‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, cessation, extinguishment.’ Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements. If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. </p>
<p id="an9.36:3.1">It’s like an archer or their apprentice who first practices on a straw man or a clay model.

<p id="an9.37:1.1">At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Kosambī, in Ghosita’s Monastery. There Ānanda addressed the mendicants: “Reverends, mendicants!” </p>
<p id="an9.37:1.4">“Reverend,” they replied. Ānanda said this: </p>
<p id="an9.37:2.1">“It’s incredible, reverends, it’s amazing! How this Blessed One who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, has found an opportunity amid confinement. It’s in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to discover the system, and to realize extinguishment. </p>

<p id="an9.37:3.3">“Reverend, one who doesn’t experience that sense-field is actually percipient, not non-percipient.” </p>

Being free, it’s stable. Being stable, it’s content. Being content, one is not anxious. What did the Buddha say was the fruit of this immersion?’ </p>

<p id="an9.38:1.1">Then two brahmin cosmologists went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="an9.38:2.1">“Master Gotama, Pūraṇa Kassapa claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus: ‘Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.’ He says: ‘With infinite knowledge I know and see that the world is infinite.’ And the Jain ascetic of the Ñātika clan also claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing, to know and see everything without exception, thus: ‘Knowledge and vision are constantly and continually present to me, while walking, standing, sleeping, and waking.’ He says: ‘With infinite knowledge I know and see that the world is finite.’ These two claim to speak from knowledge, but they directly contradict each other. Which one of them speaks the truth, and which falsehood?” </p>
<p id="an9.38:3.1">“Enough, brahmins. Leave this aside: ‘These two claim to speak from knowledge, but they directly contradict each other. Which one of them speaks the truth, and which falsehood?’ I will teach you the Dhamma. Listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="an9.38:3.6">“Yes sir,” those brahmins replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="an9.38:4.1">“Suppose there were four men standing in the four quarters. Each of them was extremely fast, with an extremely mighty stride. They’re as fast as a light arrow easily shot across the shadow of a palm tree by a well-trained expert archer with a strong bow. Their stride was such that it spanned from the eastern ocean to the western ocean. Then the man standing in the east would say: ‘I will reach the end of the world by traveling.’ Though he’d travel for his whole lifespan of a hundred years—pausing only to eat and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness—he’d die along the way, never reaching the end of the world. Then the man standing in the west … Then the man standing in the north … Then the man standing in the south would say: ‘I will reach the end of the world by traveling.’ Though he’d travel for his whole lifespan of a hundred years—pausing only to eat and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness—he’d die along the way, never reaching the end of the world. Why is that? I say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by running like this. But I also say there’s no making an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world. </p>
<p id="an9.38:5.1">These five kinds of sensual stimulation are called the world in the training of the Noble One. What five? Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. Sounds known by the ear … Smells known by the nose … Tastes known by the tongue … Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. These five kinds of sensual stimulation are called the world in the training of the Noble One. </p>
<p id="an9.38:6.1">Take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. This is called a mendicant who, having gone to the end of the world, meditates at the end of the world. Others say of them: ‘They’re included in the world, and haven’t yet left the world.’ And I also say this: ‘They’re included in the world, and haven’t yet left the world.’ </p>
<p id="an9.38:7.1">Furthermore, take a mendicant who, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, enters and remains in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.

Others say of them: ‘They’re included in the world, and haven’t yet left the world.’ And I also say this: ‘They’re included in the world, and haven’t yet left the world.’ </p>

<p id="an9.40:1.1">“Mendicants, when a wild bull elephant is engrossed in the pasture, but other elephants—males, females, younglings, or cubs—got there first and trampled the grass, the wild bull elephant is horrified, repelled, and disgusted by that. When the wild bull elephant is engrossed in the pasture, but other elephants—males, females, younglings, or cubs—eat the broken branches that he has dragged down, the wild bull elephant is horrified, repelled, and disgusted by that. When a wild bull elephant has plunged into the pool, but other elephants—males, females, younglings, or cubs—got there first and stirred up the water with their trunks, the wild bull elephant is horrified, repelled, and disgusted by that. When a wild bull elephant has come out of the pool and the female elephants bump into him, the wild bull elephant is horrified, repelled, and disgusted by that. </p>
<p id="an9.40:2.1">At that time the wild bull elephant thinks: ‘These days I live crowded by other males, females, younglings, and cubs. I eat the grass they’ve trampled, and they eat the broken branches I’ve dragged down. I drink muddy water, and after my bath the female elephants bump into me. Why don’t I live alone, withdrawn from the herd?’ After some time he lives alone, withdrawn from the herd, and he eats untrampled grass, and other elephants don’t eat the broken branches he has dragged down. He doesn’t drink muddy water, and the female elephants don’t bump into him after his bath. </p>
<p id="an9.40:3.1">At that time the wild bull elephant thinks: ‘Formerly I lived crowded by other males, females, younglings, and cubs. I ate the grass they’d trampled, and they ate the broken branches I’d dragged down. I drank muddy water, and after my bath the female elephants bumped into me. Now I live alone, and I’m free of all these things.’ He breaks off a branch and scratches his body, happily relieving his itches. </p>
<p id="an9.40:4.1">In the same way, when a mendicant lives crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their ministers, and by monastics of other religions and their disciples, they think: ‘These days I live crowded by monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen; by rulers and their ministers, and monastics of other religions and their disciples. Why don’t I live alone, withdrawn from the group?’ They frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. Gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, they sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in front of them. </p>
<p id="an9.40:5.1">Giving up covetousness for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness. Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will. Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind free of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness. Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse. Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt. They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. They happily relieve their itches. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.

<p id="an9.41:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Mallas, near the Mallian town named Uruvelakappa. </p>
<p id="an9.41:1.2">Then the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Uruvelakappa for alms. Then, after the meal, on his return from almsround, he addressed Venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, you stay right here, while I plunge deep into the Great Wood for the day’s meditation.” </p>
<p id="an9.41:1.5">“Yes, sir,” Ānanda replied. Then the Buddha plunged deep into the Great Wood and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation. </p>
<p id="an9.41:2.1">The householder Tapussa went up to Venerable Ānanda, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an9.41:3.1">“Honorable Ānanda, we are laypeople who enjoy sensual pleasures. We like sensual pleasures, we love them and take joy in them. But renunciation seems like an abyss. I have heard that in this teaching and training there are very young mendicants whose minds are secure in renunciation; they’re confident, settled, and decided about it. They see it as peaceful. Renunciation is the dividing line between the multitude and the mendicants in this teaching and training.” </p>
<p id="an9.41:4.1">“Householder, we should see the Buddha about this matter. Come, let’s go to the Buddha and inform him about this. As he answers, so we’ll remember it.” </p>
<p id="an9.41:5.1">“Yes, sir,” replied Tapussa. Then Ānanda together with Tapussa went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. Ānanda told him what had happened. </p>
<p id="an9.41:7.1">“That’s so true, Ānanda! That’s so true! Before my awakening—when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening—I too thought, ‘Renunciation is good! Seclusion is good!’ But my mind wasn’t secure in renunciation; it wasn’t confident, settled, and decided about it. I didn’t see it as peaceful. Then I thought, ‘What is the cause, what is the reason why my mind isn’t secure in renunciation, and not confident, settled, and decided about it? Why don’t I see it as peaceful?’ Then I thought, ‘I haven’t seen the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, and so I haven’t cultivated that. I haven’t realized the benefits of renunciation, and so I haven’t developed that. That’s why my mind isn’t secure in renunciation, and not confident, settled, and decided about it. And it’s why I don’t see it as peaceful.’ Then I thought, ‘Suppose that, seeing the drawbacks of sensual pleasures, I were to cultivate that. And suppose that, realizing the benefits of renunciation, I were to develop that. It’s possible that my mind would become secure in renunciation; it would be confident, settled, and decided about it. And I would see it as peaceful.’ And so, after some time, I saw the drawbacks of sensual pleasures and cultivated that, and I realized the benefits of renunciation and developed that. Then my mind became secure in renunciation; it was confident, settled, and decided about it. I saw it as peaceful. And so, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, I entered and remained in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. While I was in that meditation, perceptions accompanied by sensual pleasures beset me due to loss of focus, and that was an affliction for me.

<p id="an10.1:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an10.1:2.1">“Sir, what is the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics?” </p>
<p id="an10.1:2.2">“Ānanda, having no regrets is the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics.” </p>
<p id="an10.1:3.1">“But what is the purpose and benefit of having no regrets?” </p>
<p id="an10.1:3.2">“Joy is the purpose and benefit of having no regrets.” </p>

<p id="an10.1:10.2">“Knowledge and vision of freedom is the purpose and benefit of disillusionment and dispassion. </p>
<p id="an10.1:11.1">So, Ānanda, the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics is not having regrets. Joy is the purpose and benefit of not having regrets. Rapture is the purpose and benefit of joy. Tranquility is the purpose and benefit of rapture. Bliss is the purpose and benefit of tranquility. Immersion is the purpose and benefit of bliss. Truly knowing and seeing is the purpose and benefit of immersion. Disillusionment and dispassion is the purpose and benefit of truly knowing and seeing. Knowledge and vision of freedom is the purpose and benefit of disillusionment and dispassion. So, Ānanda, skillful ethics progressively lead up to the highest.” </p>

<p id="an10.2:1.1">“Mendicants, an ethical person, who has fulfilled ethical conduct, need not make a wish: ‘May I have no regrets!’ It’s only natural that an ethical person has no regrets. When you have no regrets you need not make a wish: ‘May I feel joy!’ It’s only natural that joy springs up when you have no regrets. When you feel joy you need not make a wish: ‘May I experience rapture!’ It’s only natural that rapture arises when you’re joyful. When your mind is full of rapture you need not make a wish: ‘May my body become tranquil!’ It’s only natural that your body becomes tranquil when your mind is full of rapture. When your body is tranquil you need not make a wish: ‘May I feel bliss!’ It’s only natural to feel bliss when your body is tranquil. When you feel bliss you need not make a wish: ‘May my mind be immersed in samādhi!’ It’s only natural for the mind to be immersed in samādhi when you feel bliss. When your mind is immersed in samādhi you need not make a wish: ‘May I truly know and see!’ It’s only natural to truly know and see when your mind is immersed in samādhi. When you truly know and see you need not make a wish: ‘May I become disillusioned and dispassionate!’ It’s only natural to become disillusioned and dispassionate when you truly know and see. When you’re disillusioned and dispassionate you need not make a wish: ‘May I realize the knowledge and vision of freedom!’ It’s only natural to realize the knowledge and vision of freedom when you’re disillusioned and dispassionate. </p>
<p id="an10.2:2.1">And so, mendicants, the knowledge and vision of freedom is the purpose and benefit of disillusionment and dispassion. Disillusionment and dispassion is the purpose and benefit of truly knowing and seeing. Truly knowing and seeing is the purpose and benefit of immersion. Immersion is the purpose and benefit of bliss. Bliss is the purpose and benefit of tranquility. Tranquility is the purpose and benefit of rapture. Rapture is the purpose and benefit of joy. Joy is the purpose and benefit of not having regrets. Not having regrets is the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics. And so, mendicants, good qualities flow on and fill up from one to the other, for going from the near shore to the far shore.” </p>

<p id="an10.11:2.1">And how does a mendicant have five factors? It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ They are rarely ill or unwell. Their stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and fit for meditation. They’re not devious or deceitful. They reveal themselves honestly to the Teacher or sensible spiritual companions. They live with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They’re strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. They’re wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering. That’s how a mendicant has five factors. </p>

It’s not bothered by people by day, and at night it’s quiet and still. There’s little disturbance from flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles. While staying in that lodging the necessities of life—robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—are easy to come by. And in that lodging there are several senior mendicants who are very learned, inheritors of the heritage, who have memorized the teachings, the monastic law, and the outlines. From time to time they go up to those mendicants and ask them questions: ‘Why, sir, does it say this? What does that mean?’ Those venerables clarify what is unclear, reveal what is obscure, and dispel doubt regarding the many doubtful matters. That’s how a lodging has five factors. A mendicant with five factors, using and frequenting lodgings with five factors, will soon realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.” </p>

A Realized One, a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha; an independent Buddha; one freed both ways; one freed by wisdom; a personal witness; one attained to view; one freed by faith; a follower by faith; a follower of teachings; a member of the spiritual family. These are the ten people who are worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and are the supreme field of merit for the world.” </p>

A mendicant has given up five factors, is endowed with six factors, has a single guard, has four supports, has eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth, has totally given up searching, has pure intentions, has stilled the physical process, and is well freed in mind and well freed by wisdom.

<p id="an10.20:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: </p>
<p id="an10.20:2.1">“There are these ten abodes of the noble ones in which the noble ones of the past, present, and future abide. What ten? A mendicant has given up five factors, possesses six factors, has a single guard, has four supports, has eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth, has totally given up searching, has unsullied intentions, has stilled the physical process, and is well freed in mind and well freed by wisdom. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an10.20:3.1">And how has a mendicant given up five factors? It’s when a mendicant has given up sensual desire, ill will, dullness and drowsiness, restlessness and remorse, and doubt. That’s how a mendicant has given up five factors. </p>
<p id="an10.20:4.1">And how does a mendicant possess six factors? It’s when a mendicant, seeing a sight with their eyes, is neither happy nor sad. They remain equanimous, mindful and aware. Hearing a sound with their ears … Smelling an odor with their nose … Tasting a flavor with their tongue … </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an10.20:4.6">Feeling a touch with their body … Knowing a thought with their mind, they’re neither happy nor sad. They remain equanimous, mindful and aware. That’s how a mendicant possesses six factors. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an10.20:5.1">And how does a mendicant have a single guard? It’s when a mendicant’s heart is guarded by mindfulness. That’s how a mendicant has a single guard. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an10.20:6.1">And how does a mendicant have four supports? After appraisal, a mendicant uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and gets rid of some things. That’s how a mendicant has four supports. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an10.20:7.1">And how has a mendicant eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth? Different ascetics and brahmins have different idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth. For example: the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a Realized One still exists, or no longer exists, or both still exists and no longer exists, or neither still exists nor no longer exists. A mendicant has dispelled, eliminated, thrown out, rejected, let go of, given up, and relinquished all these. That’s how a mendicant has eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an10.20:8.1">And how has a mendicant totally given up searching? It’s when they’ve given up searching for sensual pleasures, for continued existence, and for a spiritual life. That’s how a mendicant has totally given up searching. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an10.20:9.1">And how does a mendicant have unsullied intentions? It’s when a mendicant has given up intentions of sensuality, malice, and cruelty. That’s how a mendicant has unsullied intentions. </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="an10.20:10.1">And how has a mendicant stilled the physical process? It’s when, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. That’s how a mendicant has stilled the physical process. </p>
<p data-counter="9" id="an10.20:11.1">And how is a mendicant well freed in mind? It’s when a mendicant’s mind is freed from greed, hate, and delusion. That’s how a mendicant is well freed in mind. </p>
<p data-counter="10" id="an10.20:12.1">And how is a mendicant well freed by wisdom? It’s when a mendicant understands: ‘I’ve given up greed, hate, and delusion, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so they’re unable to arise in the future.’ That’s how a mendicant’s mind is well freed by wisdom. </p>
<p id="an10.20:13.1">Mendicants, whether in the past, future, or present, all noble ones abide in these same ten abodes of the noble ones. These are the ten abodes of the noble ones in which the noble ones of the past, present, and future abide.” </p>

<p id="an10.21:1.1">“Mendicants, towards evening the lion, king of beasts, emerges from his den, yawns, looks all around the four quarters, and roars his lion’s roar three times. Then he sets out on the hunt. Why is that? ‘May I not injure any little creatures on unclear ground.’ </p>
<p id="an10.21:2.1">‘Lion’ is a term for the Realized One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. When the Realized One teaches Dhamma to an assembly, this is his lion’s roar. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an10.21:3.1">The Realized One possesses ten powers of a Realized One. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel. What ten? Firstly, the Realized One truly understands the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. Relying on this he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an10.21:4.1">Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the result of deeds undertaken in the past, future, and present in terms of grounds and causes. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. … </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an10.21:5.1">Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands where all paths of practice lead. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. … </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an10.21:6.1">Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the world with its many and diverse elements. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. … </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an10.21:7.1">Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the diverse convictions of sentient beings. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. … </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an10.21:8.1">Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands the faculties of other sentient beings and other individuals after comprehending them with his mind. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. … </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an10.21:9.1">Furthermore, the Realized One truly understands corruption, cleansing, and emergence regarding the absorptions, liberations, immersions, and attainments. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. … </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="an10.21:10.1">Furthermore, the Realized One recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. He remembers: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ Thus he recollects his many past lives, with features and details. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. … </p>
<p data-counter="9" id="an10.21:11.1">Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Realized One sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, he sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. … </p>
<p data-counter="10" id="an10.21:12.1">Furthermore, the Realized One has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements. Since he truly understands this, this is a power of the Realized One. … </p>
<p id="an10.21:13.1">These are the ten powers of a Realized One that the Realized One possesses. With these he claims the bull’s place, roars his lion’s roar in the assemblies, and turns the divine wheel.” </p>

<p id="an10.22:1.1">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: </p>
<p id="an10.22:2.1">“Ānanda, I claim to be assured regarding the teachings that lead to realizing by insight the various different hypotheses. So I am able to teach the Dhamma in appropriate ways to different people. Practicing accordingly, when something exists they’ll know it exists. When it doesn’t exist they’ll know it doesn’t exist. When something is inferior they’ll know it’s inferior. When it’s superior they’ll know it’s superior. When something is not supreme they’ll know it’s not supreme. When it is supreme they’ll know it’s supreme. And they will know or see or realize it in whatever way it should be known or seen or realized. This is possible.

<p id="an10.23:2.1">And what are the things that should be given up by the body, not by speech? It’s when a mendicant has committed a certain unskillful offense by way of body.

Please give up that bad bodily conduct and develop good bodily conduct.’ When spoken to by their sensible spiritual companions they give up that bad bodily conduct and develop good bodily conduct.

<p id="an10.26:1.1">At one time Venerable Mahākaccāna was staying in the land of the Avantis near Kuraraghara on Steep Mountain. </p>
<p id="an10.26:1.2">Then the laywoman Kāḷī of Kurughara went up to Venerable Mahākaccāna, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, this was said by the Buddha in ‘The Maidens’ Questions’: </p>

<p id="an10.26:3.1">How should we see the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement?” </p>
<p id="an10.26:4.1">“Sister, some ascetics and brahmins regard the attainment of the meditation on universal earth to be the ultimate. Thinking ‘this is the goal’, they are reborn. The Buddha directly knew the extent to which the attainment of the meditation on universal earth was the ultimate. Directly knowing this he saw the beginning, the drawback, and the escape. And he saw the knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path. Because he saw the beginning, the drawback, and the escape, and he saw the knowledge and vision of what is the path and what is not the path, he knew that he had reached the goal, peace of heart. </p>

<p id="an10.27:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>
<p id="an10.27:1.2">Then several mendicants robed up in the morning and, taking their bowls and robes, entered Sāvatthī for alms. Then it occurred to him, “It’s too early to wander for alms in Sāvatthī. Why don’t we visit the monastery of the wanderers of other religions?” </p>
<p id="an10.27:2.1">Then they went to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side. The wanderers said to them: </p>
<p id="an10.27:3.1">“Reverends, the ascetic Gotama teaches his disciples like this: ‘Please, mendicants, directly know all things. Meditate having directly known all things.’ We too teach our disciples: ‘Please, reverends, directly know all things. Live having directly known all things.’ What, then, is the difference between the ascetic Gotama’s teaching and instruction and ours?” </p>
<p id="an10.27:4.1">Those mendicants neither approved nor dismissed that statement of the wanderers of other religions. They got up from their seat, thinking, “We will learn the meaning of this statement from the Buddha himself.” </p>
<p id="an10.27:5.1">Then, after the meal, when they returned from almsround, they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. </p>
<p id="an10.27:9.1">“Mendicants, when wanderers of other religions say this, you should say to them: ‘One thing: question, passage for recitation, and answer. Two … three … four … five … six … seven … eight … nine … ten things: question, passage for recitation, and answer.’ Questioned like this, the wanderers of other religions would be stumped, and, in addition, would get frustrated. Why is that? Because they’re out of their element. I don’t see anyone in this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who could provide a satisfying answer to these questions except for the Realized One or his disciple or someone who has heard it from them. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an10.27:10.1">‘One thing: question, passage for recitation, and answer.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? Becoming completely disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding one thing, seeing its limits and fully comprehending its meaning, a mendicant makes an end of suffering in this very life. What one thing? ‘All sentient beings are sustained by food.’ Becoming completely disillusioned, dispassionate, and freed regarding this one thing, seeing its limits and fully comprehending its meaning, a mendicant makes an end of suffering in this very life. ‘One thing: question, passage for recitation, and answer.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an10.27:11.1">What two? Name and form. … </p>

<p id="an10.29:20.1">There are some ascetics and brahmins who advocate the ultimate purity of the spirit. This is the best of the advocates of the ultimate purity of the spirit, that is, when someone, going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. They teach Dhamma in order to directly know and realize this. Some sentient beings have such a doctrine. But even the sentient beings who have such a doctrine decay and perish. </p>

<p data-counter="10" id="an10.29:21.1">There are some ascetics and brahmins who advocate ultimate extinguishment in this very life. This is the best of those who advocate extinguishment in this very life, that is, liberation by not grasping after truly understanding the origin, ending, gratification, drawback, and escape of the six fields of contact. Though I state and assert this, certain ascetics and brahmins misrepresent me with the false, hollow, lying, untruthful claim: ‘The ascetic Gotama doesn’t advocate the complete understanding of sensual pleasures, forms, or feelings.’ But I do advocate the complete understanding of sensual pleasures, forms, and feelings. And I advocate complete extinguishment by not grasping in this very life, wishless, extinguished, and cooled.” </p>

<p id="an10.30:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>
<p id="an10.30:1.2">Now at that time King Pasenadi of Kosala returned from combat after winning a battle and succeeding in his objective. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went to the monastery. He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and entered the monastery on foot. </p>
<p id="an10.30:1.5">At that time several mendicants were walking mindfully in the open air. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala went up to them and said, “Sirs, where is the Blessed One at present, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha? For I want to see the Buddha.” </p>
<p id="an10.30:1.9">“Great king, that’s his dwelling, with the door closed. Approach it quietly, without hurrying; go onto the porch, clear your throat, and knock with the latch. The Buddha will open the door.” </p>
<p id="an10.30:2.1">So the king approached the Buddha’s dwelling, cleared his throat and knocked, and the Buddha opened the door. Then King Pasenadi entered the Buddha’s dwelling. He bowed with his head at the Buddha’s feet, caressing them and covering them with kisses, and pronounced his name: “Sir, I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala! I am Pasenadi, king of Kosala!” </p>
<p id="an10.30:3.1">“But great king, for what reason do you demonstrate such utmost devotion for this body, conveying your manifest love?” </p>
<p id="an10.30:3.2">“Sir, it’s because of my gratitude and thanks for the Buddha that I demonstrate such utmost devotion, conveying my manifest love. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an10.30:4.1">The Buddha is practicing for the welfare and happiness of the people. He has established many people in the noble system, that is, the principles of goodness and skillfulness. This is a reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an10.30:5.1">Furthermore, the Buddha is ethical, possessing ethical conduct that is mature, noble, and skillful. This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an10.30:6.1">Furthermore, the Buddha lives in the wilderness, frequenting remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an10.30:7.1">Furthermore, the Buddha is content with any kind of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an10.30:8.1">Furthermore, the Buddha is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world. This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an10.30:9.1">Furthermore, the Buddha gets to take part in talk about self-effacement that helps open the heart, when he wants, without trouble or difficulty. That is, talk about fewness of wishes, contentment, seclusion, aloofness, arousing energy, ethics, immersion, wisdom, freedom, and the knowledge and vision of freedom. This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an10.30:10.1">Furthermore, the Buddha gets the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when he wants, without trouble or difficulty. This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love. </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="an10.30:11.1">Furthermore, the Buddha recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. He remembers: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so he recollects his many kinds of past lives, with features and details. This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love. </p>
<p data-counter="9" id="an10.30:12.1">Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, the Buddha sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ He understands how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love. </p>
<p data-counter="10" id="an10.30:13.1">Furthermore, the Buddha has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements. This is another reason that I demonstrate such utmost devotion for the Buddha, conveying my manifest love. </p>
<p id="an10.30:14.1">Well, now, sir, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.” </p>
<p id="an10.30:14.3">“Please, great king, go at your convenience.” Then King Pasenadi got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. </p>

Is this thing found in me or not?’ If it’s not, and if they are unable to respond when asked “Venerable, where was this spoken by the Buddha?” there will be people who say: ‘Come on, venerable, train in the monastic code first.’ These are the five things they should check in themselves. </p>
<p id="an10.44:7.1">What five things should they establish in themselves? ‘I will speak at the right time, not at the wrong time. I will speak truthfully, not falsely.

<p id="an10.45:1.1">“Mendicants, there are ten drawbacks to entering a royal harem. What ten? </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an10.45:1.3">Firstly, a king is sitting with his chief queen when a monk enters. When the queen sees the monk she smiles, or when the monk sees the queen he smiles. So the king thinks: ‘They’ve done it for sure, or they will do it.’ This is the first drawback of entering a royal harem. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an10.45:2.1">Furthermore, a king has many duties, and much to do. He has sex with one of the women but doesn’t remember. She gets pregnant from that. So the king thinks: ‘No-one else has entered here, except for that monk. Could this be the monk’s doing?’ This is the second drawback of entering a royal harem. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an10.45:3.1">Furthermore, a gem is lost somewhere in the royal harem. So the king thinks: ‘No-one else has entered here, except for that monk. Could this be the monk’s doing?’ This is the third drawback of entering a royal harem. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an10.45:4.1">Furthermore, secret deliberations in the royal harem are leaked outside. So the king thinks: ‘No-one else has entered here, except for that monk. Could this be the monk’s doing?’ This is the fourth drawback of entering a royal harem. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an10.45:5.1">Furthermore, in a royal harem, a father longs for their son, or a son longs for his father. They think: ‘No-one else has entered here, except for that monk. Could this be the monk’s doing?’ This is the fifth drawback of entering a royal harem. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an10.45:6.1">Furthermore, the king promotes someone to a higher position. Those who are upset by this think: ‘The king is close to that monk. Could this be the monk’s doing?’ This is the sixth drawback of entering a royal harem. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an10.45:7.1">Furthermore, the king demotes someone to a lower position. Those who are upset by this think: ‘The king is close to that monk. Could this be the monk’s doing?’ This is the seventh drawback of entering a royal harem. </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="an10.45:8.1">Furthermore, the king dispatches the army at the wrong time. Those who are upset by this think: ‘The king is close to that monk. Could this be the monk’s doing?’ This is the eighth drawback of entering a royal harem. </p>
<p data-counter="9" id="an10.45:9.1">Furthermore, the king dispatches the army at the right time, but orders it to turn back while still on the road. Those who are upset by this think: ‘The king is close to that monk. Could this be the monk’s doing?’ This is the ninth drawback of entering a royal harem. </p>
<p id="an10.45:10.1">Furthermore, in the royal harem there is a trampling of elephants, horses, and chariots, as well as arousing sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches that do not befit a monk. This is the tenth drawback of entering a royal harem. </p>

Firstly, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. When a mendicant is ethical, this warm-hearted quality makes for fondness and respect, conducing to inclusion, harmony, and unity, without quarreling. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an10.50:5.1">Furthermore, a mendicant is very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure.

<p data-counter="10" id="an10.50:13.1">Furthermore, a mendicant is wise. They have the wisdom of arising and passing away which is noble, penetrative, and leads to the complete ending of suffering.

<p id="an10.55:1.1">There Sāriputta addressed the mendicants: “Reverends, mendicants!” </p>
<p id="an10.55:1.3">“Reverend,” they replied. Sāriputta said this: </p>
<p id="an10.55:2.1">“Reverends, they speak of a person liable to decline, and one not liable to decline. But how did the Buddha define a person liable to decline, and one not liable to decline?” </p>
<p id="an10.55:2.4">“Reverend, we would travel a long way to learn the meaning of this statement in the presence of Venerable Sāriputta. May Venerable Sāriputta himself please clarify the meaning of this. The mendicants will listen and remember it.” </p>
<p id="an10.55:3.1">“Then listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="an10.55:3.2">“Yes, reverend,” they replied. Sāriputta said this: </p>
<p id="an10.55:4.1">“How did the Buddha define a person liable to decline? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t get to hear a teaching they haven’t heard before. They forget those teachings they have heard. They don’t keep rehearsing the teachings they’ve already got to know. And they don’t come to understand what they haven’t understood before. That’s how the Buddha defined a person liable to decline. </p>
<p id="an10.55:5.1">And how did the Buddha define a person not liable to decline? It’s when a mendicant gets to hear a teaching they haven’t heard before. They remember those teachings they have heard. They keep rehearsing the teachings they’ve already got to know. And they come to understand what they haven’t understood before. That’s how the Buddha defined a person not liable to decline. </p>
<p id="an10.55:6.1">If a mendicant isn’t skilled in the ways of another’s mind, then they should train themselves: ‘I will be skilled in the ways of my own mind.’ </p>
<p id="an10.55:7.1">And how is a mendicant skilled in the ways of their own mind? Suppose there was a woman or man who was young, youthful, and fond of adornments, and they check their own reflection in a clean bright mirror or a clear bowl of water. If they see any dirt or blemish there, they’d try to remove it. But if they don’t see any dirt or blemish there, they’re happy with that, as they’ve got all they wished for: ‘How fortunate that I’m clean!’ </p>
<p id="an10.55:7.5">In the same way, checking is very helpful for a mendicant’s skillful qualities. ‘Is contentment often found in me or not? Is kind-heartedness often found in me or not? Is freedom from dullness and drowsiness often found in me or not? Is calm often found in me or not? Is confidence often found in me or not? Is love often found in me or not? Is purity of mind often found in me or not? Is internal joy with the teaching found in me or not? Is internal serenity of heart found in me or not? Is the higher wisdom of discernment of principles found in me or not?’ </p>
<p id="an10.55:8.1">Suppose a mendicant, while checking, doesn’t see any of these skillful qualities in themselves. In order to get them they should apply intense enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness. Suppose your clothes or head were on fire. In order to extinguish it, you’d apply intense enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness. In the same way, they should apply intense enthusiasm to get those skillful qualities … </p>
<p id="an10.55:9.1">Suppose a mendicant, while checking, sees some of these skillful qualities in themselves, but doesn’t see others. Grounded on the skillful qualities they see, they should apply intense enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness in order to get the skillful qualities they don’t see. Suppose your clothes or head were on fire. In order to extinguish it, you’d apply intense enthusiasm, effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness.

<p id="an10.60:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Now at that time Venerable Girimānanda was sick, suffering, gravely ill. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an10.60:2.1">“Sir, Venerable Girimānanda is sick, suffering, gravely ill. Sir, please go to Venerable Girimānanda out of compassion.” </p>
<p id="an10.60:2.3">“Ānanda, if you were to recite to the mendicant Girimānanda these ten perceptions, it’s possible that after hearing them his illness will die down on the spot. </p>
<p id="an10.60:3.1">What ten? The perceptions of impermanence, not-self, ugliness, drawbacks, giving up, fading away, cessation, dissatisfaction with the whole world, impermanence of all conditions, and mindfulness of breathing. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an10.60:4.1">And what is the perception of impermanence? It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this: ‘Form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness are impermanent.’ And so they meditate observing impermanence in the five grasping aggregates. This is called the perception of impermanence. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an10.60:5.1">And what is the perception of not-self? It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this: ‘The eye and sights, ear and sounds, nose and smells, tongue and tastes, body and touches, and mind and thoughts are not-self.’ And so they meditate observing not-self in the six interior and exterior sense fields. This is called the perception of not-self. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an10.60:6.1">And what is the perception of ugliness? It’s when a mendicant examines their own body up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth. ‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’ And so they meditate observing ugliness in this body. This is called the perception of ugliness. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an10.60:7.1">And what is the perception of drawbacks? It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this: ‘This body has much suffering and many drawbacks. For this body is beset with many kinds of affliction, such as the following. Diseases of the eye, inner ear, nose, tongue, body, head, outer ear, mouth, teeth, and lips. Cough, asthma, catarrh, inflammation, fever, stomach ache, fainting, dysentery, gastric pain, cholera, leprosy, boils, eczema, tuberculosis, epilepsy, herpes, itch, scabs, smallpox, scabies, hemorrhage, diabetes, piles, pimples, and ulcers. Afflictions stemming from disorders of bile, phlegm, wind, or their conjunction. Afflictions caused by change in weather, by not taking care of yourself, by overexertion, or as the result of past deeds. Cold, heat, hunger, thirst, defecation, and urination.’ And so they meditate observing drawbacks in this body. This is called the perception of drawbacks. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an10.60:8.1">And what is the perception of giving up? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen, and they don’t tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them. This is called the perception of giving up. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an10.60:9.1">And what is the perception of fading away? It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this: ‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, fading away, extinguishment.’ This is called the perception of fading away. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an10.60:10.1">And what is the perception of cessation? It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, and reflects like this: ‘This is peaceful; this is sublime—that is, the stilling of all activities, the letting go of all attachments, the ending of craving, cessation, extinguishment.’ This is called the perception of cessation. </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="an10.60:11.1">And what is the perception of dissatisfaction with the whole world? It’s when a mendicant lives giving up and not grasping on to the attraction and grasping to the world, the mental fixation, insistence, and underlying tendencies. This is called the perception of dissatisfaction with the whole world. </p>
<p data-counter="9" id="an10.60:12.1">And what is the perception of the impermanence of all conditions? It’s when a mendicant is horrified, repelled, and disgusted with all conditions. This is called the perception of the impermanence of all conditions. </p>
<p data-counter="10" id="an10.60:13.1">And what is mindfulness of breathing? It’s when a mendicant has gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, sits down cross-legged, sets their body straight, and establishes mindfulness in front of them. Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out. Breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ Breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ Breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the whole body.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the whole body.’They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling the physical process.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling the physical process.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing rapture.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing rapture.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing bliss.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing bliss.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing mental processes.’They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in stilling mental processes.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out stilling mental processes.’They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in experiencing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out experiencing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in gladdening the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out gladdening the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in immersing the mind in samādhi.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out immersing the mind in samādhi.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in freeing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out freeing the mind.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing impermanence.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing impermanence.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing fading away.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing fading away.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing cessation.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing cessation.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe in observing letting go.’ They practice like this: ‘I’ll breathe out observing letting go.’ This is called mindfulness of breathing. </p>

<p id="an10.60:15.1">Then Ānanda, having learned these ten perceptions from the Buddha himself, went to Girimānanda and recited them. Then after Girimānanda heard these ten perceptions his illness died down on the spot. And that’s how he recovered from that illness. </p>

<p id="an10.72:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Vesālī, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof, together with several well-known senior disciples. They included Venerables Cāla, Upacāla, Kakkaṭa, Kaṭimbha, Kaṭa, Kaṭissaṅga, and other well-known senior disciples. </p>
<p id="an10.72:2.1">Now at that time several well-known Licchavis plunged deep into the Great Wood to see the Buddha. Driving a succession of fine carriages, they made a dreadful racket. Then those venerables thought: </p>

There we can meditate comfortably, free of noise and crowds.” Then those venerables went to the Gosiṅga Sal Wood, where they meditated comfortably, free of noise and crowds. </p>

Rapture is a thorn to the third absorption. Breathing is a thorn to the fourth absorption. Perception and feeling are a thorn to the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling.

<p id="an10.75:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. Then Venerable Ānanda robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of the laywoman Migasālā, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then the laywoman Migasālā went up to Ānanda, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an10.75:2.1">“Honorable Ānanda, how on earth are we supposed to understand the teaching taught by the Buddha, when the chaste and the unchaste are both reborn in exactly the same place in the next life? My father Purāṇa was celibate, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex. When he passed away the Buddha declared that, since he was a once-returner, he was reborn in the host of Joyful Gods. But my uncle Isidatta was not celibate; he lived content with his wife. When he passed away the Buddha also declared that, since he was a once-returner, he was reborn in the host of Joyful Gods. </p>

<p id="an10.75:4.1">Then Ānanda, after receiving almsfood at Migasālā’s home, rose from his seat and left. Then after the meal, on his return from almsround, Ānanda went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. </p>
<p id="an10.75:8.1">“Ānanda, who is this laywoman Migasālā, a foolish incompetent aunty, with an aunty’s wit? And who is it that knows how to assess individuals? </p>

<p id="an10.81:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. Then Venerable Bāhuna went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an10.81:1.3">“Sir, how many things has the Realized One escaped from, so that he lives unattached, liberated, his mind free of limits?” </p>
<p id="an10.81:2.1">“Bāhuna, the Realized One has escaped from ten things, so that he lives unattached, liberated, his mind free of limits. What ten? Form … feeling … perception … choices … consciousness … rebirth … old age … death … suffering … defilements … Suppose there was a blue water lily, or a pink or white lotus. Though it sprouted and grew in the water, it would rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to it. In the same way, the Realized One has escaped from ten things, so that he lives unattached, liberated, his mind free of limits.” </p>

<p id="an10.89:1.3">“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.” </p>
<p id="an10.89:2.1">For a second time Kokālika said to the Buddha, “Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have corrupt wishes. They’ve fallen under the sway of corrupt wishes.” </p>
<p id="an10.89:2.3">“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.” </p>
<p id="an10.89:3.1">For a third time Kokālika said to the Buddha, “Despite my faith and trust in the Buddha, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have corrupt wishes. They’ve fallen under the sway of corrupt wishes.” </p>
<p id="an10.89:3.3">“Don’t say that, Kokālika! Don’t say that, Kokālika! Have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.” </p>
<p id="an10.89:4.1">Then Kokālika got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. Not long after he left his body erupted with boils the size of mustard seeds. The boils grew to the size of mung beans, then chickpeas, then jujube seeds, then jujubes, then myrobalans, then unripe wood apples, then ripe wood apples. Finally they burst open, and pus and blood oozed out. He just laid down on banana leaves like a poisoned fish. </p>
<p id="an10.89:5.1">Then Tudu the independent brahmā went to Kokālika, and standing in the sky he said to him, “Kokālika, have confidence in Sāriputta and Moggallāna, they’re good monks.” </p>
<p id="an10.89:5.4">“Who are you, reverend?” </p>
<p id="an10.89:5.5">“I am Tudu the independent brahmā.” </p>
<p id="an10.89:5.6">“Didn’t the Buddha declare you a non-returner? So what exactly are you doing back here? See how far you have strayed!” </p>
<p id="an10.89:6.1">Then Tudu addressed Kokālika in verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an10.89:7.1">“A person is born <br/>with an axe in their mouth. <br/>A fool cuts themselves with it <br/>when they say bad words. </p>
<p id="an10.89:8.1">When you praise someone worthy of criticism, <br/>or criticize someone worthy of praise, <br/>you choose bad luck with your own mouth: <br/>you’ll never find happiness that way. </p>
<p id="an10.89:9.1">Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing, <br/>if all you lose is your money <br/>and all you own, even yourself. <br/>What’s really terrible luck <br/>is to hate the holy ones. </p>
<p id="an10.89:10.1">For more than two quinquadecillion years, <br/>and another five quattuordecillion years, <br/>a slanderer of noble ones goes to hell, <br/>having aimed bad words and thoughts at them.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="an10.89:11.1">Then the mendicant Kokālika died of that illness. He was reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna. </p>
<p id="an10.89:12.1">Then, late at night, the beautiful Brahmā Sahampati, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him, “Sir, the mendicant Kokālika has passed away. He was reborn in the pink lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.” </p>
<p id="an10.89:12.4">That’s what Brahmā Sahampati said. Then he bowed and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right side, before vanishing right there. </p>
<p id="an10.89:13.1">Then, when the night had passed, the Buddha told the mendicants all that had happened. </p>
<p id="an10.89:14.1">When he said this, one of the mendicants asked the Buddha, “Sir, how long is the life span in the Pink Lotus hell?” </p>
<p id="an10.89:14.3">“It’s long, mendicant. It’s not easy to calculate how many years, how many hundreds or thousands or hundreds of thousands of years it lasts.” </p>
<p id="an10.89:15.1">“But sir, is it possible to give a simile?” </p>
<p id="an10.89:15.2">“It’s possible,” said the Buddha. </p>
<p id="an10.89:15.3">“Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed. And at the end of every hundred years someone would remove a single seed from it. By this means the Kosalan cartload of twenty bushels of sesame seed would run out faster than a single lifetime in the Abbuda hell. Now, twenty lifetimes in the Abbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Nirabbuda hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Nirabbuda hell equal one lifetime in the Ababa hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Ababa hell equal one lifetime in the Aṭaṭa hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Aṭaṭa hell equal one lifetime in the Ahaha hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Ahaha hell equal one lifetime in the Yellow Lotus hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Yellow Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Sweet-Smelling hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Sweet-Smelling hell equal one lifetime in the Blue Water Lily hell. Twenty lifetimes in the Blue Water Lily hell equal one lifetime in the White Lotus hell. Twenty lifetimes in the White Lotus hell equal one lifetime in the Pink Lotus hell. The mendicant Kokālika has been reborn in the Pink Lotus hell because of his resentment for Sāriputta and Moggallāna.” </p>
<p id="an10.89:15.15">That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an10.89:16.1">“A person is born <br/>with an axe in their mouth. <br/>A fool cuts themselves with it <br/>when they say bad words. </p>
<p id="an10.89:17.1">When you praise someone worthy of criticism, <br/>or criticize someone worthy of praise, <br/>you choose bad luck with your own mouth: <br/>you’ll never find happiness that way. </p>
<p id="an10.89:18.1">Bad luck at dice is a trivial thing, <br/>if all you lose is your money <br/>and all you own, even yourself. <br/>What’s really terrible luck <br/>is to hate the holy ones. </p>
<p id="an10.89:19.1">For more than two quinquadecillion years, <br/>and another five quattuordecillion years, <br/>a slanderer of noble ones goes to hell, <br/>having aimed bad words and thoughts at them.” </p>

<p id="an10.90:1.1">Then Venerable Sāriputta went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: </p>
<p id="an10.90:1.2">“Sāriputta, how many powers does a mendicant who has ended the defilements have that qualify them to claim: ‘My defilements have ended.’” </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an10.90:2.1">“Sir, a mendicant who has ended the defilements has ten powers that qualify them to claim: ‘My defilements have ended.’ What ten? Firstly, a mendicant with defilements ended has clearly seen with right wisdom all conditions as truly impermanent.

<p data-counter="2" id="an10.90:3.1">Furthermore, a mendicant with defilements ended has clearly seen with right wisdom that sensual pleasures are truly like a pit of glowing coals. This is a power that a mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim: ‘My defilements have ended.’ </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an10.90:4.1">Furthermore, the mind of a mendicant with defilements ended slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion. They’re withdrawn, loving renunciation, and they’ve totally done with defiling influences. This is a power that a mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim: ‘My defilements have ended.’ </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an10.90:5.1">Furthermore, a mendicant with defilements ended has well developed the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. This is a power that a mendicant who has ended the defilements relies on to claim: ‘My defilements have ended.’ </p>

<p id="an10.92:1.1">Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: </p>
<p id="an10.92:2.1">“Householder, when a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble system with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’ </p>
<p id="an10.92:3.1">What are the five dangers and threats they have quelled? Anyone who kills living creatures creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. Anyone who refrains from killing living creatures creates no dangers and threats either in the present life or in lives to come, and doesn’t experience mental pain and sadness. So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from killing living creatures. </p>
<p id="an10.92:4.1">Anyone who steals … Anyone who commits sexual misconduct … Anyone who lies … Anyone who uses alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates dangers and threats both in the present life and in lives to come, and experiences mental pain and sadness. Anyone who refrains from using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence creates no dangers and threats either in the present life or in lives to come, and doesn’t experience mental pain and sadness. So that danger and threat is quelled for anyone who refrains from using alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. These are the five dangers and threats they have quelled. </p>
<p id="an10.92:5.1">What are the four factors of stream-entry that they have? It’s when a noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ They have experiential confidence in the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ And a noble disciple’s ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. These are the four factors of stream-entry that they have. </p>
<p id="an10.92:6.1">And what is the noble system that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom? It’s when a noble disciple reflects: ‘When this exists, that is; due to the arising of this, that arises. When this doesn’t exist, that is not; due to the cessation of this, that ceases. That is: Ignorance is a condition for choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates. When ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, choices cease. When choices cease, consciousness ceases. When consciousness ceases, name and form cease. When name and form cease, the six sense fields cease. When the six sense fields cease, contact ceases. When contact ceases, feeling ceases. When feeling ceases, craving ceases. When craving ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.’ This is the noble system that they have clearly seen and comprehended with wisdom. </p>
<p id="an10.92:7.1">When a noble disciple has quelled five dangers and threats, has the four factors of stream-entry, and has clearly seen and comprehended the noble cycle with wisdom, they may, if they wish, declare of themselves: ‘I’ve finished with rebirth in hell, the animal realm, and the ghost realm. I’ve finished with all places of loss, bad places, the underworld. I am a stream-enterer! I’m not liable to be reborn in the underworld, and am bound for awakening.’” </p>

<p id="an10.93:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>
<p id="an10.93:1.2">Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika left Sāvatthī in the middle of the day to see the Buddha. Then it occurred to him, “It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha, as he’s in retreat. And it’s the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicants, as they’re in retreat. Why don’t I visit the monastery of the wanderers of other religions?” </p>
<p id="an10.93:2.1">Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions. Now at that time, the wanderers of other religions had come together, making an uproar, a dreadful racket as they sat and talked about all kinds of low topics. </p>
<p id="an10.93:2.3">They saw Anāthapiṇḍika coming off in the distance, and stopped each other, saying, “Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound. The householder Anāthapiṇḍika, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is coming into our monastery. He is included among the white-clothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing in Sāvatthī. Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise the quiet. Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.” </p>
<p id="an10.93:3.1">Then those wanderers of other religions fell silent. Then Anāthapiṇḍika went up to them, and exchanged greetings with those wanderers. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The wanderers said to him, “Tell us, householder, what is the view of the ascetic Gotama?” </p>
<p id="an10.93:3.5">“Sirs, I don’t know all his views.” </p>
<p id="an10.93:4.1">“Well then, since it seems you don’t know all the views of the ascetic Gotama, tell us, what are the views of the mendicants?” </p>
<p id="an10.93:4.3">“Sirs, I don’t know all the mendicants’ views.” </p>
<p id="an10.93:5.1">“Well then, since it seems you don’t know all the views of the ascetic Gotama or of the mendicants, tell us, householder, what is your view?” </p>
<p id="an10.93:5.3">“Sirs, it’s not hard for me to explain what my views are. But please, let the venerables explain their own convictions first. Afterwards it won’t be hard for me to explain my views.” </p>
<p id="an10.93:6.1">When he said this, one of the wanderers said to him, “The cosmos is eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly. That’s my view, householder.” </p>
<p id="an10.93:7.1">Another wanderer said, “The cosmos is not eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly. That’s my view, householder.” </p>
<p id="an10.93:8.1">Another wanderer said, “The world is finite …” … “The world is infinite …” … “The soul and the body are the same thing …” … “The soul and the body are different things …” … “A Realized One still exists after death …” … “A Realized One no longer exists after death …” … “A Realized One both still exists and no longer exists after death …” … “A Realized One neither still exists nor no longer exists after death. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly. That’s my view, householder.” </p>
<p id="an10.93:9.1">When this was said, Anāthapiṇḍika said this, “Sirs, regarding the venerable who said this: ‘The cosmos is eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly. That’s my view, householder.’ This view of his has either arisen from his own irrational application of mind, or is conditioned by what someone else says. But that view is created, conditioned, chosen, dependently originated. Anything that is created, conditioned, chosen, and dependently originated is impermanent. And what’s impermanent is suffering. What he clings to and holds to is just suffering. </p>

<h4 class="sutta-title heading"><span class="sutta-heading acronym">AN 10.94</span><span class="sutta-heading translated-title">With Vajjiyamāhita </span><span class="sutta-heading root-title">Vajjiyamāhitasutta</span></h4>
<p id="an10.94:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Campā on the banks of the Gaggarā Lotus Pond. </p>
<p id="an10.94:1.2">Then the householder Vajjiyamāhita left Sāvatthī in the middle of the day to see the Buddha. Then it occurred to him, “It’s the wrong time to see the Buddha, as he’s in retreat. And it’s the wrong time to see the esteemed mendicants, as they’re in retreat. Why don’t I visit the monastery of the wanderers of other religions?” </p>
<p id="an10.94:2.1">Then he went to the monastery of the wanderers of other religions. Now at that time, the wanderers of other religions had come together, making an uproar, a dreadful racket as they sat and talked about all kinds of low topics. </p>
<p id="an10.94:3.1">They saw Vajjiyamāhita coming off in the distance, and stopped each other, saying, “Be quiet, good sirs, don’t make a sound. The householder Vajjiyamāhita, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is coming into our monastery. He is included among the white-clothed lay disciples of the ascetic Gotama, who is residing near Campā. Such venerables like the quiet, are educated to be quiet, and praise the quiet. Hopefully if he sees that our assembly is quiet he’ll see fit to approach.” </p>
<p id="an10.94:4.1">Then those wanderers of other religions fell silent. Then Vajjiyamāhita went up to them, and exchanged greetings with the wanderers there. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side. The wanderers said to him: </p>
<p id="an10.94:4.4">“Is it really true, householder? Does the ascetic Gotama criticize all forms of mortification? Does he categorically condemn and denounce those fervent mortifiers who live rough?” </p>
<p id="an10.94:4.5">“No, sirs, the Buddha does not criticize all forms of mortification. Nor does he categorically condemn and denounce those fervent mortifiers who live rough. The Buddha criticizes where it is due, and praises where it is due. In doing so he is one who speaks after analyzing the question, and is not definitive on this point.” </p>
<p id="an10.94:5.1">When he said this, one of the wanderers said to him, “Hold on, householder! That ascetic Gotama who you praise is an exterminator who refrains from making statements.” </p>
<p id="an10.94:5.3">“On this point, also, I reasonably respond to the venerables. The Buddha has stated ‘This is skillful’ and ‘This is unskillful’. So when it comes to what is skillful and unskillful the Buddha makes a statement. He is not an exterminator who refrains from making statements.” </p>
<p id="an10.94:6.1">When this was said, those wanderers sat silent, dismayed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say. Seeing this, Vajjiyamāhita got up from his seat. He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed. </p>
<p id="an10.94:7.1">“Good, good, householder! That’s how you should legitimately and completely refute those foolish men from time to time. Householder, I don’t say that all mortifications should be undergone. But I don’t say that no mortifications should be undergone. I don’t say that all observances should be undertaken. But I don’t say that no observances should be undertaken. I don’t say that all efforts should be tried. But I don’t say that no efforts should be tried. I don’t say that everything should be given up. But I don’t say that nothing should be given up. I don’t say that you should be liberated with all kinds of freedom. But I don’t say that you should not be liberated with any kind of freedom. </p>
<p id="an10.94:8.1">When undergoing certain mortifications, unskillful qualities grow while skillful qualities decline. I say that you shouldn’t undergo those mortifications. When undergoing certain mortifications, unskillful qualities decline while skillful qualities grow. I say that you should undergo those mortifications. </p>

<p id="an10.95:1.1">Then the wanderer Uttiya went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. </p>
<p id="an10.95:1.2">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, “Master Gotama, is this right: ‘The cosmos is eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly’?” </p>
<p id="an10.95:1.4">“This has not been declared by me, Uttiya.” </p>
<p id="an10.95:2.1">“Then is this right: ‘The cosmos is not eternal. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly’?” </p>
<p id="an10.95:2.2">“This has not been declared by me, Uttiya.” </p>
<p id="an10.95:3.1">“Then is this right: ‘The world is finite …’ … ‘The world is infinite …’ … ‘The soul and the body are the same thing …’ … ‘The soul and the body are different things …’ … ‘A Realized One still exists after death …’ … ‘A Realized One no longer exists after death …’ … ‘A Realized One both still exists and no longer exists after death …’ … ‘A Realized One neither still exists nor no longer exists after death. This is the only truth, other ideas are silly’?” </p>
<p id="an10.95:3.9">“This has not been declared by me, Uttiya.” </p>
<p id="an10.95:4.1">“When asked about all these points, Master Gotama says that they have not been declared by him. </p>
<p id="an10.95:6.1">So what exactly has been declared by Master Gotama?” </p>
<p id="an10.95:7.1">“Uttiya, I teach my disciples from my own insight in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.” </p>
<p id="an10.95:8.1">“But when Master Gotama teaches in this way, is the whole world saved, or half, or a third?” But when he said this, the Buddha kept silent. </p>
<p id="an10.95:9.1">Then Venerable Ānanda thought, “The wanderer Uttiya must not get the harmful misconception: ‘When the ascetic Gotama was asked this all-important question he falters without answering. He just can’t do it!’ That would be for his lasting harm and suffering.” </p>
<p id="an10.95:10.1">Then Ānanda said to the wanderer Uttiya, “Well then, Reverend Uttiya, I shall give you a simile. For by means of a simile some sensible people understand the meaning of what is said. Suppose there was a king’s frontier citadel with fortified embankments, ramparts, and arches, and a single gate. And it has a gatekeeper who is astute, competent, and clever. He keeps strangers out and lets known people in. As he walks around the patrol path, he doesn’t see a hole or cleft in the wall, not even one big enough for a cat to slip out. He doesn’t know how many creatures enter or leave the citadel. But he does know that whatever sizable creatures enter or leave the citadel, all of them do so via this gate. </p>
<p id="an10.95:11.1">In the same way, it’s not the Realized One’s concern whether the whole world is saved by this, or half, or a third. But the Realized One knows that whoever is saved from the world—whether in the past, the future, or the present—all have given up the five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. They have firmly established their mind in the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. And they have truly developed the seven awakening factors. That’s how they’re saved from the world, in the past, future, or present. Uttiya, you were just asking the Buddha the same question as before in a different way. That’s why he didn’t answer.” </p>

They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view.

<p id="an10.99:1.1">Then Venerable Upāli went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him, “Sir, I wish to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.” </p>
<p id="an10.99:2.1">“Upāli, remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest are challenging. It’s hard to maintain seclusion and hard to find joy in it. Staying alone, the forests seem to rob the mind of a mendicant who isn’t immersed in samādhi. If someone should say this, ‘Though I don’t have immersion, I’m going to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.’ You can expect that they’ll sink down or float away. </p>
<p id="an10.99:3.1">Suppose there was a large lake, and along comes a bull elephant with a height of seven or eight cubits. He’d think, ‘Why don’t I plunge into this lake and play around while washing my ears and back? When I’ve bathed and drunk, I’ll emerge from the water and go wherever I want.’ And that’s just what he does. Why is that? Because his large life-form finds a footing in the depths. </p>
<p id="an10.99:4.1">Then along comes a rabbit or a cat. They’d think, ‘What difference is there between me and a bull elephant? Why don’t I plunge into this lake and play around while washing my ears and back? When I’ve bathed and drunk, I’ll emerge from the water and go wherever I want.’ They jump into the lake rashly, without thinking. You can expect that they’ll sink down or float away. Why is that? Because their little life-form finds no footing in the depths. If someone should say this, ‘Though I don’t have immersion, I’m going to frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest.’ You can expect that they’ll sink down or float away. </p>
<p id="an10.99:5.1">Suppose there was a little baby boy playing in his own urine and feces. What do you think, Upāli? Isn’t that a totally foolish game?” </p>
<p id="an10.99:5.4">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an10.99:6.1">“After some time that boy grows up and his faculties mature. He accordingly plays childish games such as toy plows, tip-cat, somersaults, pinwheels, toy measures, toy carts, and toy bows. What do you think, Upāli? Aren’t such games better than what he did before?” </p>
<p id="an10.99:6.5">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an10.99:7.1">“After some time that boy grows up and his faculties mature further. He accordingly amuses himself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. Sights known by the eye that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. Sounds known by the ear … Smells known by the nose … Tastes known by the tongue … Touches known by the body that are likable, desirable, agreeable, pleasant, sensual, and arousing. What do you think, Upāli? Aren’t such games better than what he did before?” </p>
<p id="an10.99:7.10">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an10.99:8.1">“But then a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. </p>
<p id="an10.99:9.1">A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in a good family. They gain faith in the Realized One and reflect, ‘Living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ </p>
<p id="an10.99:10.1">After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. </p>
<p id="an10.99:11.1">Once they’ve gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings. </p>
<p id="an10.99:12.1">They give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving. </p>
<p id="an10.99:13.1">They give up unchastity. They are celibate, set apart, avoiding the vulgar act of sex. </p>
<p id="an10.99:14.1">They give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and trustworthy, and don’t trick the world with their words. </p>
<p id="an10.99:15.1">They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony. </p>
<p id="an10.99:16.1">They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people. </p>
<p id="an10.99:17.1">They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial. </p>
<p id="an10.99:18.1">They avoid injuring plants and seeds. They eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time. They avoid seeing shows of dancing, singing, and music . They avoid beautifying and adorning themselves with garlands, perfumes, and makeup. They avoid high and luxurious beds. They avoid receiving gold and money, raw grains, raw meat, women and girls, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants, cows, horses, and mares, and fields and land. They avoid running errands and messages; buying and selling; falsifying weights, metals, or measures; bribery, fraud, cheating, and duplicity; mutilation, murder, abduction, banditry, plunder, and violence. </p>
<p id="an10.99:19.1">They’re content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden. In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves. </p>
<p id="an10.99:20.1">When they see a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving restraint over it. When they hear a sound with their ears … When they smell an odor with their nose … When they taste a flavor with their tongue … When they feel a touch with their body … When they know a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint. When they have this noble sense restraint, they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves. </p>
<p id="an10.99:21.1">They act with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent. </p>
<p id="an10.99:22.1">When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness, they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. Gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, they sit down cross-legged, set their body straight, and establish mindfulness in front of them. </p>
<p id="an10.99:23.1">Giving up covetousness for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of covetousness, cleansing the mind of covetousness. Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will. Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness. Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse. Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt. </p>
<p id="an10.99:24.1">They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. What do you think, Upāli? Isn’t this state better than what they had before?” </p>
<p id="an10.99:24.5">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an10.99:25.1">“When my disciples see this quality inside themselves they frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. But so far they haven’t achieved their own goal. </p>
<p id="an10.99:26.1">Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and mind at one, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. What do you think, Upāli? Isn’t this state better than what they had before?” </p>
<p id="an10.99:26.4">“Yes, sir.” </p>

<p id="an10.99:28.1">Furthermore, with the fading away of rapture, a mendicant enters and remains in the third absorption. They meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ What do you think, Upāli? Isn’t this state better than what they had before?” </p>
<p id="an10.99:28.4">“Yes, sir.” </p>

<p id="an10.99:30.1">Furthermore, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, a mendicant enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. …” … </p>
<p id="an10.99:31.1">“Furthermore, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, a mendicant enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. What do you think, Upāli? Isn’t this state better than what they had before?” </p>

<p id="an10.99:34.1">“Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. …” … </p>
<p id="an10.99:35.1">“Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, aware that ‘this is peaceful, this is sublime’, they enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. What do you think, Upāli? Isn’t this state better than what they had before?” </p>
<p id="an10.99:35.4">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an10.99:36.1">“When my disciples see this quality inside themselves they frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. But so far they haven’t achieved their own goal. </p>
<p id="an10.99:37.1">Furthermore, going totally beyond the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, they enter and remain in the cessation of perception and feeling. And, having seen with wisdom, their defilements come to an end. What do you think, Upāli? Isn’t this state better than what they had before?” </p>
<p id="an10.99:37.4">“Yes, sir.” </p>
<p id="an10.99:38.1">“When my disciples see this quality inside themselves they frequent remote lodgings in the wilderness and the forest. And they have achieved their own goal. Come on, Upāli, stay with the Saṅgha. If you stay with the Saṅgha you’ll be comfortable.” </p>

Though you were face to face with the Buddha, you overlooked him, imagining that you should ask me about this matter. For he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the manifestation of divinity. He is the teacher, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the bestower of the deathless, the lord of truth, the Realized One. That was the time to approach the Buddha and ask about this matter.

But he’d pass over the roots and trunk, imagining that the heartwood should be sought in the branches and leaves. Such is the consequence for the venerables. Though you were face to face with the Buddha, you overlooked him, imagining that you should ask me about this matter. For he is the Buddha, the one who knows and sees. He is vision, he is knowledge, he is the manifestation of principle, he is the manifestation of divinity.

<p id="an10.176:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Pāvā in Cunda the smith’s mango grove. Then Cunda the smith went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, “Cunda, whose purity do you believe in?” </p>
<p id="an10.176:1.5">“Sir, I believe in the purity advocated by the western brahmins draped with moss who carry pitchers, serve the sacred flame, and immerse themselves in water.” </p>
<p id="an10.176:2.1">“But Cunda, what kind of purity do these western brahmins advocate?” </p>
<p id="an10.176:2.2">“The western brahmins encourage their disciples like this: ‘Please, good people, rising early you should stroke the earth from your bed. If you don’t stroke the earth, stroke fresh cow dung. If you don’t stroke fresh cow dung, stroke green grass. If you don’t stroke green grass, serve the sacred flame. If you don’t serve the sacred flame, revere the sun with joined palms. If you don’t revere the sun with joined palms, immerse yourself in water three times, including the evening.’ The western brahmins advocate this kind of purity.” </p>
<p id="an10.176:3.1">“The purity advocated by the western brahmins is quite different from that in the training of the Noble One.” </p>
<p id="an10.176:3.2">“But what, Master Gotama, is purity in the training of the Noble One? Master Gotama, please teach me this.” </p>
<p id="an10.176:4.1">“Well then, brahmin, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="an10.176:4.2">“Yes, sir,” Cunda replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="an10.176:5.1">“Cunda, impurity is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of mind. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an10.176:6.1">And how is impurity threefold by way of body? It’s when a certain person kills living creatures. They’re violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an10.176:7.1">They steal. With the intention to commit theft, they take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an10.176:8.1">They commit sexual misconduct. They have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal. </p>
<p id="an10.176:9.1">This is the threefold impurity by way of body. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an10.176:10.1">And how is impurity fourfold by way of speech? It’s when a certain person lies. They’re summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, mister, say what you know.’ Not knowing, they say ‘I know.’ Knowing, they say ‘I don’t know.’ Not seeing, they say ‘I see.’ And seeing, they say ‘I don’t see.’ So they deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an10.176:11.1">They speak divisively. They repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. And so they divide those who are harmonious, supporting division, delighting in division, loving division, speaking words that promote division. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an10.176:12.1">They speak harshly. They use the kinds of words that are cruel, nasty, hurtful, offensive, bordering on anger, not leading to immersion. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an10.176:13.1">They talk nonsense. Their speech is untimely, and is neither factual nor beneficial. It has nothing to do with the teaching or the training. Their words have no value, and are untimely, unreasonable, rambling, and pointless. This is the fourfold impurity by way of speech. </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="an10.176:14.1">And how is impurity threefold by way of mind? It’s when a certain person is covetous. They covet the wealth and belongings of others: ‘Oh, if only their belongings were mine!’ </p>
<p data-counter="9" id="an10.176:15.1">They have ill will and malicious intentions: ‘May these sentient beings be killed, slaughtered, slain, destroyed, or annihilated!’ </p>
<p data-counter="10" id="an10.176:16.1">They have wrong view. Their perspective is distorted: ‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no such thing as mother and father, or beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’ This is the threefold impurity by way of mind. </p>
<p id="an10.176:17.1">These are the ten ways of doing unskillful deeds. When you have these ten ways of doing unskillful deeds, then if you rise early, whether or not you stroke the earth from your bed, you’re still impure. </p>
<p id="an10.176:18.1">Whether or not you stroke fresh cow dung, you’re still impure. </p>
<p id="an10.176:19.1">Whether or not you stroke green grass, you’re still impure. </p>
<p id="an10.176:20.1">Whether or not you serve the sacred flame, you’re still impure. </p>
<p id="an10.176:21.1">Whether or not you revere the sun with joined palms, you’re still impure. </p>
<p id="an10.176:22.1">Whether or not you immerse yourself in water three times, you’re still impure. Why is that? These ten ways of doing unskillful deeds are impure and make things impure. </p>
<p id="an10.176:23.1">It’s because of those who do these ten kinds of unskillful deeds that hell, the animal realm, the ghost realm, or any other bad places are found. </p>
<p id="an10.176:24.1">Cunda, purity is threefold by way of body, fourfold by way of speech, and threefold by way of mind. </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an10.176:25.1">And how is purity threefold by way of body? It’s when a certain person gives up killing living creatures. They renounce the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an10.176:26.1">They give up stealing. They don’t, with the intention to commit theft, take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an10.176:27.1">They give up sexual misconduct. They don’t have sexual relations with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They don’t have sexual relations with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal. </p>
<p id="an10.176:28.1">This is the threefold purity by way of body. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an10.176:29.1">And how is purity fourfold by way of speech? It’s when a certain person gives up lying. They’re summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, mister, say what you know.’ Not knowing, they say ‘I don’t know.’ Knowing, they say ‘I know.’ Not seeing, they say ‘I don’t see.’ And seeing, they say ‘I see.’ So they don’t deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an10.176:30.1">They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an10.176:31.1">They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an10.176:32.1">They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial. </p>
<p id="an10.176:33.1">This is the fourfold purity by way of speech. </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="an10.176:34.1">And how is purity threefold by way of mind? It’s when a certain person is content. They don’t covet the wealth and belongings of others: ‘Oh, if only their belongings were mine!’ </p>
<p data-counter="9" id="an10.176:35.1">They have a kind heart and loving intentions: ‘May these sentient beings live free of enmity and ill will, untroubled and happy!’ </p>
<p data-counter="10" id="an10.176:36.1">They have right view, an undistorted perspective: ‘There is meaning in giving, sacrifice, and offerings. There are fruits and results of good and bad deeds. There is an afterlife. There are such things as mother and father, and beings that are reborn spontaneously. And there are ascetics and brahmins who are rightly comported and rightly practiced, and who describe the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’ </p>
<p id="an10.176:37.1">This is the threefold purity by way of mind. </p>
<p id="an10.176:38.1">These are the ten ways of doing skillful deeds. When you have these ten ways of doing skillful deeds, then if you rise early, whether or not you stroke the earth from your bed, you’re still pure. </p>
<p id="an10.176:39.1">Whether or not you stroke fresh cow dung, you’re still pure. </p>
<p id="an10.176:40.1">Whether or not you stroke green grass, you’re still pure. </p>
<p id="an10.176:41.1">Whether or not you serve the sacred flame, you’re still pure. </p>
<p id="an10.176:42.1">Whether or not you revere the sun with joined palms, you’re still pure. </p>
<p id="an10.176:43.1">Whether or not you immerse yourself in water three times, you’re still pure. Why is that? These ten ways of doing skillful deeds are pure and make things pure. </p>
<p id="an10.176:44.1">It’s because of those who do these ten kinds of skillful deeds that gods, humans, or any other good places are found.” </p>
<p id="an10.176:45.1">When he said this, Cunda the smith said to the Buddha, “Excellent, sir! Excellent! … From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<p id="an10.177:1.1">Then the brahmin Jānussoṇi went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. </p>
<p id="an10.177:1.2">When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha, “We who are known as brahmins give gifts and perform memorial rites for the dead: ‘May this gift aid my departed relatives and family. May they partake of this gift.’ But does this gift really aid departed relatives and family? Do they actually partake of it?” </p>
<p id="an10.177:2.6">“It aids them if the conditions are right, brahmin, but not if the conditions are wrong.” </p>
<p id="an10.177:3.1">“Then, Master Gotama, what are the right and wrong conditions?” </p>
<p id="an10.177:3.2">“Brahmin, take someone who kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, with wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in hell. There they survive feeding on the food of the hell beings. The conditions there are wrong, so the gift does not aid the one who lives there. </p>
<p id="an10.177:4.1">Take someone else who kills living creatures … and has wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the animal realm.

The conditions there too are wrong, so the gift does not aid the one who lives there. </p>
<p id="an10.177:6.1">Take someone else who doesn’t kill living creatures … and has right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of the gods.

<p id="an10.177:7.1">Take someone else who kills living creatures … and has wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the ghost realm. There they survive feeding on the food of the beings in the ghost realm. Or else they survive feeding on what friends and colleagues, relatives and kin provide them with from here. The conditions there are right, so the gift aids the one who lives there.” </p>
<p id="an10.177:8.1">“But Master Gotama, who partakes of that gift if the departed relative is not reborn in that place?” </p>
<p id="an10.177:8.2">“Other departed relatives reborn there will partake of that gift.” </p>
<p id="an10.177:9.1">“But who partakes of the gift when neither that relative nor other relatives have been reborn in that place?” </p>
<p id="an10.177:9.2">“It’s impossible, brahmin, it cannot happen that that place is vacant of departed relatives in all this long time. It’s never fruitless for the donor.” </p>
<p id="an10.177:10.1">“Does Master Gotama propose this even when the conditions are wrong?” </p>
<p id="an10.177:10.2">“I propose this even when the conditions are wrong. Take someone who kills living creatures, steals, and commits sexual misconduct. They use speech that’s false, divisive, harsh, or nonsensical. And they’re covetous, malicious, with wrong view. They give to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, perfumes, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in the company of elephants. There they get to have food and drink, garlands and various adornments. </p>

<p id="an11.1:1.1"><span class="evam">So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. </p>
<p id="an11.1:1.3">Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an11.1:1.4">“Sir, what is the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics?” </p>
<p id="an11.1:1.5">“Ānanda, having no regrets is the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics.” </p>
<p id="an11.1:2.1">“But what is the purpose and benefit of having no regrets?” </p>
<p id="an11.1:2.2">“Joy is the purpose and benefit of having no regrets.” </p>
<p id="an11.1:3.1">“But what is the purpose and benefit of joy?” </p>
<p id="an11.1:3.2">“Rapture …” </p>
<p id="an11.1:4.1">“But what is the purpose and benefit of rapture?” </p>
<p id="an11.1:4.2">“Tranquility …” </p>
<p id="an11.1:5.1">“But what is the purpose and benefit of tranquility?” </p>
<p id="an11.1:5.2">“Bliss …” </p>
<p id="an11.1:6.1">“But what is the purpose and benefit of bliss?” </p>
<p id="an11.1:6.2">“Immersion …” </p>
<p id="an11.1:7.1">“But what is the purpose and benefit of immersion?” </p>
<p id="an11.1:7.2">“Truly knowing and seeing …” </p>
<p id="an11.1:8.1">“But what is the purpose and benefit of truly knowing and seeing?” </p>
<p id="an11.1:8.2">“Disillusionment …” </p>
<p id="an11.1:9.1">“But what is the purpose and benefit of disillusionment?” </p>
<p id="an11.1:9.2">“Dispassion …” </p>
<p id="an11.1:10.1">“But what is the purpose and benefit of dispassion?” </p>
<p id="an11.1:10.2">“Knowledge and vision of freedom is the purpose and benefit of dispassion. </p>
<p id="an11.1:11.1">So, Ānanda, the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics is not having regrets. Joy is the purpose and benefit of not having regrets. Rapture is the purpose and benefit of joy. Tranquility is the purpose and benefit of rapture. Bliss is the purpose and benefit of tranquility. Immersion is the purpose and benefit of bliss. Truly knowing and seeing is the purpose and benefit of immersion. Disillusionment is the purpose and benefit of truly knowing and seeing. Dispassion is the purpose and benefit of disillusionment. And knowledge and vision of freedom is the purpose and benefit of dispassion. So, Ānanda, skillful ethics progressively lead up to the highest.” </p>

<p id="an11.2:1.1">“Mendicants, an ethical person, who has fulfilled ethical conduct, need not make a wish: ‘May I have no regrets!’ It’s only natural that an ethical person has no regrets. </p>
<p id="an11.2:2.1">When you have no regrets you need not make a wish: ‘May I feel joy!’ It’s only natural that joy springs up when you have no regrets. </p>
<p id="an11.2:3.1">When you feel joy you need not make a wish: ‘May I experience rapture!’ It’s only natural that rapture arises when you’re joyful. </p>
<p id="an11.2:4.1">When your mind is full of rapture you need not make a wish: ‘May my body become tranquil!’ It’s only natural that your body becomes tranquil when your mind is full of rapture. </p>
<p id="an11.2:5.1">When your body is tranquil you need not make a wish: ‘May I feel bliss!’ It’s only natural to feel bliss when your body is tranquil. </p>
<p id="an11.2:6.1">When you feel bliss you need not make a wish: ‘May my mind be immersed in samādhi!’ It’s only natural for the mind to become immersed in samādhi when you feel bliss. </p>
<p id="an11.2:7.1">When your mind is immersed in samādhi you need not make a wish: ‘May I truly know and see!’ It’s only natural to truly know and see when your mind is immersed in samādhi. </p>
<p id="an11.2:8.1">When you truly know and see you need not make a wish: ‘May I grow disillusioned!’ It’s only natural to grow disillusioned when you truly know and see. </p>
<p id="an11.2:9.1">When you’re disillusioned you need not make a wish: ‘May I become dispassionate!’ It’s only natural to grow dispassionate when you’re disillusioned. </p>
<p id="an11.2:10.1">When you’re dispassionate you need not make a wish: ‘May I realize the knowledge and vision of freedom!’ It’s only natural to realize the knowledge and vision of freedom when you’re dispassionate. </p>
<p id="an11.2:11.1">And so, mendicants, the knowledge and vision of freedom is the purpose and benefit of dispassion. Dispassion is the purpose and benefit of disillusionment. Disillusionment is the purpose and benefit of truly knowing and seeing. Truly knowing and seeing is the purpose and benefit of immersion. Immersion is the purpose and benefit of bliss. Bliss is the purpose and benefit of tranquility. Tranquility is the purpose and benefit of rapture. Rapture is the purpose and benefit of joy. Joy is the purpose and benefit of not having regrets. Not having regrets is the purpose and benefit of skillful ethics. And so, mendicants, good qualities flow on and fill up from one to the other, for going from the near shore to the far shore.” </p>

And they wouldn’t perceive the dimension of infinite space in the dimension of infinite space, the dimension of infinite consciousness in the dimension of infinite consciousness, the dimension of nothingness in the dimension of nothingness, or the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. They wouldn’t perceive this world in this world, or the other world in the other world. And they wouldn’t perceive what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind.

<p id="an11.9:2.3">And how does a wild colt meditate? A wild colt, tied up by the feeding trough, meditates: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ Why is that? Because it doesn’t occur to the wild colt tied up by the feeding trough: ‘What task will the horse trainer have me do today? How should I respond?’ Tied up by the feeding trough they just meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ </p>
<p id="an11.9:2.9">In the same way, take a certain wild person who has gone to the forest, the root of a tree, or an empty hut. Their heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire, and they don’t truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen. Harboring sensual desire within they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate. Their heart is overcome by ill will … dullness and drowsiness … restlessness and remorse … doubt … Harboring doubt within they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate. They meditate dependent on earth, water, fire, and air. They meditate dependent on the dimension of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, or neither perception nor non-perception. They meditate dependent on this world or the other world. They meditate dependent on what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind. That’s how a wild colt meditates. </p>
<p id="an11.9:3.1">And how does a thoroughbred meditate? A fine thoroughbred, tied up by the feeding trough, doesn’t meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ Why is that? Because it occurs to the fine thoroughbred tied up by the feeding trough: ‘What task will the horse trainer have me do today? How should I respond?’ Tied up by the feeding trough they don’t meditate: ‘Fodder, fodder!’ For that fine thoroughbred regards the use of the goad as a debt, a bond, a loss, a misfortune. </p>
<p id="an11.9:3.8">In the same way, take a certain fine thoroughbred person who has gone to the forest, the root of a tree, or an empty hut. Their heart is not overcome and mired in sensual desire, and they truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen. Their heart is not overcome by ill will … dullness and drowsiness … restlessness and remorse … doubt … They don’t meditate dependent on earth, water, fire, and air. They don’t meditate dependent on the dimension of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, or neither perception nor non-perception. They don’t meditate dependent on this world or the other world. They don’t meditate dependent on what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind. Yet they do meditate. </p>
<p id="an11.9:3.15">When a fine thoroughbred meditates like this, the gods together with Indra, Brahmā, and the Progenitor worship them from afar: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an11.9:4.1">‘Homage to you, O thoroughbred! <br/>Homage to you, supreme among men! <br/>We don’t understand <br/>the basis of your absorption.’” </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="an11.9:5.1">When he said this, Venerable Sandha asked the Buddha, “But sir, how does that fine thoroughbred meditate?” </p>
<p id="an11.9:7.1">“Sandha, for a fine thoroughbred person, the perception of earth has vanished in relation to earth. The perception of water … fire … air has vanished in relation to air. The perception of the dimension of infinite space has vanished in relation to the dimension of infinite space. The perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness … nothingness … neither perception nor non-perception has vanished in relation to the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. The perception of this world has vanished in relation to this world. The perception of the other world has vanished in relation to the other world. And the perception of what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind has vanished. That’s how that fine thoroughbred person doesn’t meditate dependent on earth, water, fire, and air. They don’t meditate dependent on the dimension of infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, or neither perception nor non-perception. They don’t meditate dependent on this world or the other world. They don’t meditate dependent on what is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, or explored by the mind. Yet they do meditate. </p>
<p id="an11.9:7.5">When a fine thoroughbred person meditates like this, the gods together with Indra, Brahmā, and the Progenitor worship them from afar: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an11.9:8.1">‘Homage to you, O thoroughbred! <br/>Homage to you, supreme among men! <br/>We don’t understand <br/>the basis of your absorption.’” </p>

<p id="an11.10:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, at the monastery of the wanderers in the peacocks’ feeding ground. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” </p>
<p id="an11.10:1.4">“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p id="an11.10:2.1">“Mendicants, a mendicant who has three qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans. What three? The entire spectrum of an adept’s ethics, immersion, and wisdom. A mendicant with these three qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans. </p>
<p id="an11.10:3.1">A mendicant who has another three qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans. What three? A demonstration of psychic power, a demonstration of revealing, and a demonstration of instruction. A mendicant with these three qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans. </p>
<p id="an11.10:4.1">A mendicant who has another three qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans. What three? Right view, right knowledge, and right freedom. A mendicant with these three qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans. </p>
<p id="an11.10:5.1">A mendicant who has two qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans. What two? Knowledge and conduct. A mendicant with these two qualities has reached the ultimate end, the ultimate sanctuary from the yoke, the ultimate spiritual life, the ultimate goal. They are best among gods and humans. Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra also spoke this verse: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an11.10:6.1">‘The aristocrat is best among people <br/>who take clan as the standard. <br/>But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct <br/>is first among gods and humans.’ </p>
</blockquote>
<p id="an11.10:7.1">Now, that verse spoken by Brahmā Sanaṅkumāra is well spoken, not poorly spoken. It’s beneficial, not pointless, and I agree with it. I also say: </p>
<blockquote class="gatha">
<p id="an11.10:8.1">‘The aristocrat is best among people <br/>who take clan as the standard. <br/>But one accomplished in knowledge and conduct <br/>is first among gods and humans.’” </p>

<p id="an11.11:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. </p>
<p id="an11.11:1.2">At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering. </p>
<p id="an11.11:1.4">Mahānāma the Sakyan heard about this. He went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: </p>
<p id="an11.11:2.2">“Sir, I have heard that several mendicants are making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering. Now, we spend our life in various ways. Which of these should we practice?” </p>
<p id="an11.11:3.1">“Good, good, Mahānāma! It’s appropriate that gentlemen such as you come to me and ask: ‘We spend our life in various ways. Which of these should we practice?’ The faithful succeed, not the faithless. The energetic succeed, not the lazy. The mindful succeed, not the unmindful. Those with immersion succeed, not those without immersion. The wise succeed, not the witless. </p>
<p id="an11.11:3.9">When you’re grounded on these five things, go on to develop six further things. </p>
<p id="an11.11:3.10">Firstly, you should recollect the Realized One: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ When a noble disciple recollects the Realized One their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. At that time their mind is unswerving, based on the Realized One. A noble disciple whose mind is unswerving finds inspiration in the meaning and the teaching, and finds joy connected with the teaching. When they’re joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when they’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and developed the recollection of the Buddha. </p>
<p id="an11.11:4.1">Furthermore, you should recollect the teaching: ‘The teaching is well explained by the Buddha—apparent in the present life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.’ When a noble disciple recollects the teaching their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. … This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and developed the recollection of the teaching. </p>
<p id="an11.11:5.1">Furthermore, you should recollect the Saṅgha: ‘The Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples is practicing the way that’s good, direct, systematic, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha’s disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.’ When a noble disciple recollects the Saṅgha their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. … This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and developed the recollection of the Saṅgha. </p>
<p id="an11.11:6.1">Furthermore, a noble disciple recollects their own ethical conduct, which is unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion. When a noble disciple recollects their ethical conduct their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. … This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and developed the recollection of their ethical conduct. </p>
<p id="an11.11:7.1">Furthermore, you should recollect your own generosity: ‘I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate. Among people with hearts full of the stain of stinginess I live at home rid of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share.’ When a noble disciple recollects their own generosity their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. … This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled. They’ve entered the stream of the teaching and developed the recollection of generosity. </p>
<p id="an11.11:8.1">Furthermore, you should recollect the deities: ‘There are the Gods of the Four Great Kings, the Gods of the Thirty-Three, the Gods of Yama, the Joyful Gods, the Gods Who Love to Create, the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others, the Gods of Brahmā’s Host, and gods even higher than these. When those deities passed away from here, they were reborn there because of their faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. I, too, have the same kind of faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom.’ When a noble disciple recollects the faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom of both themselves and the deities their mind is not full of greed, hate, and delusion. At that time their mind is unswerving, based on the deities. A noble disciple whose mind is unswerving finds inspiration in the meaning and the teaching, and finds joy connected with the teaching. When they’re joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, they feel bliss. And when they’re blissful, the mind becomes immersed in samādhi. This is called a noble disciple who lives in balance among people who are unbalanced, and lives untroubled among people who are troubled.

<p id="an11.13:1.1">At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. </p>
<p id="an11.13:1.2">Now at that time the Buddha wanted to commence the rains residence at Sāvatthī. </p>

<p id="an11.13:3.1">So the Buddha commenced the rains residence in Sāvatthī, and so did Nandiya. There he applied himself to his work and from time to time got to see the Buddha. </p>
<p id="an11.13:3.4">At that time several mendicants were making a robe for the Buddha, thinking that when his robe was finished and the three months of the rains residence had passed the Buddha would set out wandering. </p>

<p id="an11.13:8.1">Furthermore, you should recollect your good friends: ‘I’m fortunate, so very fortunate, to have good friends who advise and instruct me out of kindness and compassion.’ In this way you should establish mindfulness internally based on good friends. </p>
<p id="an11.13:9.1">Furthermore, you should recollect your own generosity: ‘I’m so fortunate, so very fortunate.

<p id="an11.13:10.1">Furthermore, you should recollect the deities: ‘There are deities who, surpassing the company of deities that consume solid food, are reborn in a certain host of mind-made deities. They don’t see in themselves anything more to do, or anything that needs improvement.’ An irreversibly freed mendicant doesn’t see in themselves anything more to do, or anything that needs improvement. In the same way, Nandiya, there are deities who, surpassing the company of deities that consume solid food, are reborn in a certain host of mind-made deities.

<p id="an11.13:11.1">A noble disciple who has these eleven qualities gives up bad, unskillful qualities and doesn’t cling to them.

<p id="an11.14:1.1">And then Venerable Subhūti together with the mendicant Saddha went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, “Subhūti, what is the name of this mendicant?” </p>
<p id="an11.14:1.3">“Sir, the name of this mendicant is Saddha. He is the son of the layman Sudatta, and has gone forth out of faith from the lay life to homelessness.” </p>
<p id="an11.14:2.1">“Well, I hope this mendicant Saddha exhibits the outcomes of faith.” </p>
<p id="an11.14:2.2">“Now is the time, Blessed One! Now is the time, Holy One! Let the Buddha to speak on the outcomes of faith. Now I will find out whether or not this mendicant Saddha exhibits the outcomes of faith.” </p>
<p id="an11.14:3.1">“Well then, Subhūti, listen and apply your mind well, I will speak.” </p>
<p id="an11.14:3.2">“Yes, sir,” Subhūti replied. The Buddha said this: </p>
<p data-counter="1" id="an11.14:4.1">“Firstly, a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. When a mendicant is ethical, this is an outcome of faith. </p>
<p data-counter="2" id="an11.14:5.1">Furthermore, a mendicant is very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically. When a mendicant is learned, this is an outcome of faith. </p>
<p data-counter="3" id="an11.14:6.1">Furthermore, a mendicant has good friends, companions, and associates. When a mendicant has good friends, this is an outcome of faith. </p>
<p data-counter="4" id="an11.14:7.1">Furthermore, a mendicant is easy to admonish, having qualities that make them easy to admonish. They’re patient, and take instruction respectfully. When a mendicant is easy to admonish, this is an outcome of faith. </p>
<p data-counter="5" id="an11.14:8.1">Furthermore, a mendicant is deft and tireless in a diverse spectrum of duties for their spiritual companions, understanding how to go about things in order to complete and organize the work. When a mendicant is deft and tireless in a diverse spectrum of duties, this is an outcome of faith. </p>
<p data-counter="6" id="an11.14:9.1">Furthermore, a mendicant loves the teachings and is a delight to converse with, being full of joy in the teaching and training. When a mendicant loves the teachings, this is an outcome of faith. </p>
<p data-counter="7" id="an11.14:10.1">Furthermore, a mendicant lives with energy roused up for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities. They are strong, staunchly vigorous, not slacking off when it comes to developing skillful qualities. When a mendicant is energetic, this is an outcome of faith. </p>
<p data-counter="8" id="an11.14:11.1">Furthermore, a mendicant gets the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty. When a mendicant gets the four absorptions, this is an outcome of faith. </p>
<p data-counter="9" id="an11.14:12.1">Furthermore, a mendicant recollects many kinds of past lives. That is: one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand rebirths; many eons of the world contracting, many eons of the world expanding, many eons of the world contracting and expanding. They remember: ‘There, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn somewhere else. There, too, I was named this, my clan was that, I looked like this, and that was my food. This was how I felt pleasure and pain, and that was how my life ended. When I passed away from that place I was reborn here.’ And so they recollect their many kinds of past lives, with features and details. When a mendicant recollects many kinds of past lives, this is an outcome of faith. </p>
<p data-counter="10" id="an11.14:13.1">Furthermore, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, a mendicant sees sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. ‘These dear beings did bad things by way of body, speech, and mind. They spoke ill of the noble ones; they had wrong view; and they acted out of that wrong view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell. These dear beings, however, did good things by way of body, speech, and mind. They never spoke ill of the noble ones; they had right view; and they acted out of that right view. When their body breaks up, after death, they’re reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.’ And so, with clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, they see sentient beings passing away and being reborn—inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, in a good place or a bad place. They understand how sentient beings are reborn according to their deeds. When a mendicant has clairvoyance that is purified and superhuman, this is an outcome of faith. </p>
<p data-counter="11" id="an11.14:14.1">Furthermore, a mendicant has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life, and lives having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. When a mendicant has ended the defilements, this is an outcome of faith.” </p>
<p id="an11.14:15.1">When he said this, Venerable Subhūti said to the Buddha: </p>
<p id="an11.14:15.2">“Sir, the outcomes of faith for a faithful person that the Buddha speaks of are found in this mendicant; he does exhibit them. </p>
<p id="an11.14:16.1">This mendicant is ethical … </p>

<p id="an11.16:1.1">At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Vesālī in the little village of Beluva. </p>
<p id="an11.16:1.2">Now at that time the householder Dasama from the city of Aṭṭhaka had arrived at Pāṭaliputta on some business. He went to the Chicken Monastery, approached a certain mendicant, and said to him, “Sir, where is Venerable Ānanda now staying? For I want to see him.” </p>
<p id="an11.16:2.4">“Householder, Venerable Ānanda is staying near Vesālī in the little village of Beluva.” </p>
<p id="an11.16:3.1">Then the householder Dasama, having concluded his business there, went to the little village of Beluva in Vesālī to see Ānanda. He bowed, sat down to one side, and said to Ānanda: </p>
<p id="an11.16:3.2">“Honorable Ānanda, is there one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary from the yoke?” </p>
<p id="an11.16:3.3">“There is, householder.” </p>
<p id="an11.16:4.1">“And what is that one thing?” </p>
<p id="an11.16:4.2">“Householder, it’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. Then they reflect: ‘Even this first absorption is produced by choices and intentions.’ They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements. If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. This is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary from the yoke. </p>
<p id="an11.16:5.1">Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. Then they reflect: ‘Even this fourth absorption is produced by choices and intentions.’ They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements. If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. This too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they arrive at the supreme sanctuary from the yoke. </p>
<p id="an11.16:6.1">Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Then they reflect: ‘Even this heart’s release by love is produced by choices and intentions.’ They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements. If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. This too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One … </p>
<p id="an11.16:7.1">Furthermore, a mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of compassion … They meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing … They meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Then they reflect: ‘Even this heart’s release by equanimity is produced by choices and intentions.’ They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements. If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. This too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One … </p>
<p id="an11.16:8.1">Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. Then they reflect: ‘Even this attainment of the dimension of infinite space is produced by choices and intentions.’ They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements. If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. This too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One … </p>
<p id="an11.16:9.1">Furthermore, a mendicant, going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. … Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. … Then they reflect: ‘Even this attainment of the dimension of nothingness is produced by choices and intentions.’ They understand: ‘But whatever is produced by choices and intentions is impermanent and liable to cessation.’ Abiding in that they attain the ending of defilements. If they don’t attain the ending of defilements, with the ending of the five lower fetters they’re reborn spontaneously, because of their passion and love for that meditation. They are extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. This too is one thing that has been rightly explained by the Blessed One—who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha—practicing which a diligent, keen, and resolute mendicant’s mind is freed, their defilements are ended, and they reach the supreme sanctuary from the yoke.” </p>
<p id="an11.16:10.1">When he said this, the householder Dasama said to Venerable Ānanda: </p>
<p id="an11.16:10.2">“Honorable Ānanda, suppose a person was looking for an entrance to a hidden treasure. And all at once they’d come across eleven entrances! In the same way, I was searching for the door to the deathless. And all at once I got to hear of eleven doors to the deathless. Suppose a person had a house with eleven doors. If the house caught fire they’d be able to flee to safety through any one of those doors. In the same way, I’m able to flee to safety through any one of these eleven doors to the deathless. Sir, those of other religions will seek a fee for the teacher. Why shouldn’t I make an offering to Venerable Ānanda?” </p>
<p id="an11.16:11.1">Then the householder Dasama, having assembled the Saṅgha from Vesālī and Pāṭaliputta, served and satisfied them with his own hands with delicious fresh and cooked foods. He clothed each and every mendicant in a pair of garments, with a set of three robes for Ānanda. And he had a dwelling worth five hundred built for Ānanda. </p>

<p data-counter="4" id="an11.17:6.1">And how does a mendicant not dress wounds? When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they get caught up in the features and details. Since the faculty of sight is left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of covetousness and displeasure become overwhelming.

When they hear a sound with their ears … When they smell an odor with their nose … When they taste a flavor with their tongue … When they feel a touch with their body … When they know a thought with their mind, they get caught up in the features and details.

<p data-counter="7" id="an11.17:9.1">And how does a mendicant not know satisfaction?

It’s when a cowherd doesn’t know form, is unskilled in characteristics, doesn’t pick out flies’ eggs, doesn’t dress wounds, doesn’t smoke out pests, doesn’t know the ford, doesn’t know satisfaction, doesn’t know the trail, is not skilled in pastures, milks dry, and doesn’t show extra respect to the bulls who are fathers and leaders of the herd. A cowherd with these eleven factors can’t maintain and expand a herd of cattle. </p>

<h2>The Translator</h2>
<p><span property="dc:creator">Bhikkhu Sujato</span> was born as Anthony Aidan Best on <span class="dc:date">4/11/1966</span> in Perth, Western Australia. He grew up in the pleasant suburbs of Mt Lawley and Attadale alongside his sister Nicola, who was the good child. His mother, Margaret Lorraine Huntsman née Pinder, said “he’ll either be a priest or a poet”, while his father, Anthony Thomas Best, advised him to “never do anything for money”. He attended Aquinas College, a Catholic school, where he decided to become an atheist. At the University of WA he studied philosophy, aiming to learn what he wanted to do with his life. Finding that what he wanted to do was play guitar, he dropped out. His main band was named Martha’s Vineyard, which achieved modest success in the indie circuit. </p>
<p>A seemingly random encounter with a roadside joey took him to Thailand, where he entered his first meditation retreat at Wat Ram Poeng, Chieng Mai in 1992. Feeling the call to the Buddha’s path, he took full ordination in Wat Pa Nanachat in 1994, where his teachers were Ajahn Pasanno and Ajahn Jayasaro. In 1997 he returned to Perth to study with Ajahn Brahm at Bodhinyana Monastery. </p>
<p>He spent several years practicing in seclusion in Malaysia and Thailand before establishing Santi Forest Monastery in Bundanoon, NSW, in 2003. There he was instrumental in supporting the establishment of the Theravada bhikkhuni order in Australia and advocating for women’s rights. He continues to teach in Australia and globally, with a special concern for the moral implications of climate change and other forms of environmental destruction. He has published a series of books of original and groundbreaking research on early Buddhism. </p>
<p>In 2005 he founded SuttaCentral together with Rod Bucknell and John Kelly. In 2015, seeing the need for a complete, accurate, plain English translation of the Pali texts, he undertook the task, spending nearly three years in isolation on the isle of Qi Mei off the coast of the nation of Taiwan. He completed the four main Nikāyas in 2018, and the early books of the Khuddaka Nikāya were complete by 2021. All this work is dedicated to the public domain and is entirely free of copyright encumbrance. </p>
<p>In 2019 he returned to Sydney where he established Lokanta Vihara (The Monastery at the End of the World). </p>
<h2>Creation Process</h2>
<p>Primary source was the digital Mahāsaṅgīti edition of the Pali Tipiṭaka. Translated from the Pali, with reference to several English translations, especially those of Bhikkhu Bodhi.</p>
<h2>The Translation</h2>
<p>This translation was part of a project to translate the four Pali Nikāyas with the following aims: plain, approachable English; consistent terminology; accurate rendition of the Pali; free of copyright. It was made during 2016–2018 while Bhikkhu Sujato was staying in Qimei, Taiwan.</p>
<h2>About SuttaCentral</h2>
<p>SuttaCentral publishes early Buddhist texts. Since 2005 we have provided root texts in Pali, Chinese, Sanskrit, Tibetan, and other languages, parallels between these texts, and translations in many modern languages. Building on the work of generations of scholars, we offer our contribution freely.</p>
<p>SuttaCentral is driven by volunteer contributions, and in addition we employ professional developers. We offer a sponsorship program for high quality translations from the original languages. Financial support for SuttaCentral is handled by the SuttaCentral Development Trust, a charitable trust registered in Australia.</p>
<h2>About Bilara</h2>
<p>“Bilara” means “cat” in Pali, and it is the name of our Computer Assisted Translation (CAT) software. Bilara is a web app that enables translators to translate early Buddhist texts into their own language. These translations are published on SuttaCentral with the root text and translation side by side.</p>
<h2>About SuttaCentral Editions</h2>
<p>The SuttaCentral Editions project makes high quality books from selected Bilara translations. These are published in formats including HTML, EPUB, PDF, and print.</p>
<p>You are welcome to print any of our Editions.</p>
