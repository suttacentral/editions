\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Vajjis at the village of \textsanskrit{Bhaṇḍa}. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” 

“Venerable\marginnote{1.5} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.1} not understanding and not penetrating four things, both you and I have wandered and transmigrated for such a very long time. What four? Noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom. These noble ethics, immersion, wisdom, and freedom have been understood and comprehended. Craving for continued existence has been cut off; the conduit to rebirth is ended; now there’ll be no more future lives.” 

That\marginnote{3.1} is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: 

\begin{verse}%
“Ethics,\marginnote{4.1} immersion, and wisdom, \\
and the supreme freedom: \\
these things have been understood \\
by Gotama the renowned. 

And\marginnote{5.1} so the Buddha, having insight, \\
explained this teaching to the mendicants. \\
The teacher made an end of suffering, \\
seeing clearly, he is extinguished.”

“These\marginnote{1.1} four people are found in the world. What four? A person who goes with the stream; a person who goes against the stream; a steadfast person; and a brahmin who has crossed over and stands on the far shore. 

And\marginnote{1.4} who is the person who goes with the stream? It’s a person who takes part in sensual pleasures and does bad deeds. This is called a person who goes with the stream. 

And\marginnote{2.1} who is the person who goes against the stream? It’s a person who doesn’t take part in sensual pleasures or do bad deeds. They live the full and pure spiritual life in pain and sadness, weeping, with tearful faces. This is called a person who goes against the stream. 

And\marginnote{3.1} who is the steadfast person? It’s a person who, with the ending of the five lower fetters, is reborn spontaneously. They’re extinguished there, and are not liable to return from that world. This is called a steadfast person. 

And\marginnote{4.1} who is a brahmin who has crossed over and stands on the far shore? It’s a person who realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. This is called a brahmin who has crossed over and stands on the far shore. 

These\marginnote{4.4} are the four people found in the world. 

\begin{verse}%
All\marginnote{5.1} those people with unbridled sensuality, \\
not free of lust, enjoying sensual pleasures in this life: \\
again and again, they return to birth and old age; \\
those who go with the stream are sunk in craving. 

So\marginnote{6.1} a wise one in this life, with mindfulness established, \\
doesn’t take part in sensual pleasures and bad deeds. \\
In pain they’d give up sensual pleasures: \\
they call that person ‘one who goes against the stream’. 

Someone\marginnote{7.1} who’s given up five corruptions, \\
a perfect trainee, not liable to decline, \\
who’s mastered their mind, with faculties immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi}, \\
that’s called ‘a steadfast person’. 

The\marginnote{8.1} sage who has comprehended all things, high and low, \\
cleared them and ended them, so they are no more; \\
they’ve completed the spiritual journey, and gone to the end of the world, \\
they’re called ‘one who has gone beyond’.”

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.1} these four people are found in the world. What four? A person may have: 

\begin{enumerate}%
\item Little learning and not get the point of learning. %
\item Little learning but get the point of learning. %
\item Much learning but not get the point of learning. %
\item Much learning and get the point of learning. %

And\marginnote{1.7} how has a person learned little and not got the point of learning? It’s when a person has learned little of the statements, songs, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and classifications. And with the little they’ve learned, they understand neither the meaning nor the text, nor do they practice in line with the teaching. That’s how a person has learned little and not got the point of learning. 

And\marginnote{2.1} how has a person learned little but has got the point of learning? It’s when a person has learned little of the statements, songs, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and classifications. But with the little they’ve learned, they understand the meaning and the text, and they practice in line with the teaching. That’s how a person has learned little but has got the point of learning. 

And\marginnote{3.1} how has a person learned much but hasn't got the point of learning? It’s when a person has learned much of the statements, songs, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and classifications. But even though they’ve learned much, they understand neither the meaning nor the text, nor do they practice in line with the teaching. That’s how a person has learned much but hasn't got the point of learning. 

And\marginnote{4.1} how has a person learned much and has got the point of learning? It’s when a person has learned much of the statements, songs, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and classifications. And with the large amount they’ve learned, they understand the meaning and the text, and they practice in line with the teaching. That’s how a person has learned much and has got the point of learning.

\begin{verse}%
If\marginnote{5.1} you don’t learn much, \\
and aren’t steady in ethics, \\
they’ll criticize you on both counts, \\
for your ethics and your learning. 

If\marginnote{6.1} you don’t learn much, \\
and you are steady in ethics, \\
they’ll praise your ethical conduct, \\
since your learning has succeeded. 

If\marginnote{7.1} you learn much, \\

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” 

“Venerable\marginnote{1.5} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{2.1} this one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying near \textsanskrit{Uruvelā} at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the \textsanskrit{Nerañjarā} River. As I was in private retreat this thought came to mind: ‘One without respect and reverence lives in suffering. What ascetic or brahmin should I honor and respect and rely on?’ 

Then\marginnote{3.1} it occurred to me: ‘I would honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of ethics, if it were incomplete. But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world—with its gods, \textsanskrit{Māras}, and \textsanskrit{Brahmās}, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—who is more accomplished than myself in ethics, who I should honor and respect and rely on. 

I\marginnote{4.1} would honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of immersion, if it were incomplete. But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin … who is more accomplished than myself in immersion … 

I\marginnote{5.1} would honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entrie spectrum of wisdom, if it were incomplete. But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world … who is more accomplished than myself in wisdom … 

I\marginnote{6.1} would honor and respect and rely on another ascetic or brahmin so as to complete the entire spectrum of freedom, if it were incomplete. But I don’t see any other ascetic or brahmin in this world … who is more accomplished than myself in freedom …’ 

Then\marginnote{7.1} it occurred to me: ‘Why don’t I honor and respect and rely on the same teaching to which I was awakened?’ 

And\marginnote{8.1} then \textsanskrit{Brahmā} Sahampati, knowing what I was thinking, vanished from the \textsanskrit{Brahmā} realm and appeared in front of me, as easily as a strong man would extend or contract his arm. He arranged his robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms toward me, and said: ‘That’s so true, Blessed One! That’s so true, Holy One! All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who lived in the past honored and respected and relied on this same teaching. All the perfected ones, the fully awakened Buddhas who will live in the future will honor and respect and rely on this same teaching. May the Blessed One, who is the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha at present, also honor and respect and rely on this same teaching.’ 

That’s\marginnote{8.7} what \textsanskrit{Brahmā} Sahampati said. Then he went on to say: 

\begin{verse}%
‘All\marginnote{9.1} Buddhas, whether in the past, \\
the Buddhas of the future, \\
and the Buddha at present—\\
destroyer of the sorrows of many—

respecting\marginnote{10.1} the true teaching \\
they did live, they do live, \\
and they also will live. \\
This is the nature of the Buddhas. 

Therefore\marginnote{11.1} someone who cares for their own welfare, \\
and wants to become the very best they can be, \\
should respect the true teaching, \\
remembering the instructions of the Buddhas.’ 

%
\end{verse}

That’s\marginnote{12.1} what \textsanskrit{Brahmā} Sahampati said. Then he bowed and respectfully circled me, keeping me on his right side, before vanishing right there. Then, knowing the request of \textsanskrit{Brahmā} and what was suitable for myself, I honored and respected and relied on the same teaching to which I was awakened. And since the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} has also achieved greatness, I also respect the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}.”

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.1} this one time, when I was first awakened, I was staying near \textsanskrit{Uruvelā} at the goatherd’s banyan tree on the bank of the \textsanskrit{Nerañjarā} River. Then several old brahmins—elderly and senior, who were advanced in years and had reached the final stage of life—came up to me, and exchanged greetings with me. 

When\marginnote{1.3} the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side, and said to me: ‘Master Gotama, we have heard this: 

“The\marginnote{1.5} ascetic Gotama does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat.” And this is indeed the case, for Master Gotama does not bow to old brahmins, elderly and senior, who are advanced in years and have reached the final stage of life; nor does he rise in their presence or offer them a seat. This is not appropriate, Master Gotama.’ 

Then\marginnote{2.1} it occurred to me, ‘These venerables don’t know what a senior is, or what qualities make you a senior.’ 

Mendicants,\marginnote{2.3} suppose you’re eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old. But your speech is untimely, false, meaningless, and against the teaching or training. You say things at the wrong time which are worthless, unreasonable, rambling, and unbeneficial. Then you’ll be considered a ‘childish senior’. 

Now\marginnote{3.1} suppose you’re a youth, young, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life. But your speech is timely, true, meaningful, and in line with the teaching and training. You say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial. Then you’ll be considered an ‘astute senior’. 

There\marginnote{4.1} are these four qualities that make a senior. What four? A mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. 

They’re\marginnote{4.4} very learned, remembering and keeping what they’ve learned. These teachings are good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased, describing a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. They are very learned in such teachings, remembering them, reinforcing them by recitation, mentally scrutinizing them, and comprehending them theoretically. 

They\marginnote{4.5} get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty. 

They\marginnote{4.6} realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. 

These\marginnote{4.7} are the four qualities that make a senior. 

\begin{verse}%
The\marginnote{5.1} creature with a restless mind \\
speaks a lot of nonsense. \\
Their thoughts are unsettled, \\
and they don’t like the true teaching. \\
They’re far from seniority, with their bad views \\
and their lack of regard for others. 

But\marginnote{6.1} one accomplished in ethics, \\
learned and eloquent, that wise one \\
is restrained when experiencing phenomena, \\
discerning the meaning with wisdom. 

Gone\marginnote{7.1} beyond all things, \\
kind, eloquent, \\
they’ve given up birth and death, \\
and have completed the spiritual journey. 

That’s\marginnote{8.1} who I call a senior, \\
who has no defilements. \\
With the ending of defilements, a mendicant \\
is declared a ‘senior’.”

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.1} the world has been understood by the Realized One; and he is detached from the world. The origin of the world has been understood by the Realized One; and he has given up the origin of the world. The cessation of the world has been understood by the Realized One; and he has realized the cessation of the world. The practice that leads to the cessation of the world has been understood by the Realized One; and he has developed the practice that leads to the cessation of the world. 

In\marginnote{2.1} this world—with its gods, \textsanskrit{Māras}, and \textsanskrit{Brahmās}, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, and explored by the mind, all that has been understood by the Realized One. That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’. 

From\marginnote{3.1} the night when the Realized One understands the supreme perfect awakening until the night he becomes fully extinguished—through the element of extinguishment with nothing left over—everything he speaks, says, and expresses is real, not otherwise. That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’. 

The\marginnote{4.1} Realized One does as he says, and says as he does. Since this is so, that’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’. 

In\marginnote{5.1} this world—with its gods, \textsanskrit{Māras} and \textsanskrit{Brahmās}, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—the Realized One is the undefeated, the champion, the universal seer, the wielder of power. That’s why he’s called the ‘Realized One’. 

\begin{verse}%
Directly\marginnote{6.1} knowing the whole world as it is, \\
and everything in it, \\
he is detached from the whole world, \\
disengaged from the whole world. 

That\marginnote{7.1} wise one is the champion \\
who is released from all ties. \\
He has reached ultimate peace: \\
extinguishment, fearing nothing from any quarter. 

He\marginnote{8.1} is the Buddha, with defilements ended, \\
untroubled, with doubts cut off. \\
He has attained the end of all deeds, \\
freed with the end of attachments. 

That\marginnote{9.1} Blessed One is the Buddha, \\
he is the supreme lion, \\
in all the world with its gods, \\
he turns the holy wheel. 

And\marginnote{10.1} so those gods and humans, \\
who have gone to the Buddha for refuge, \\
come together and revere him, \\
great of heart and rid of naivety: 

‘Tamed,\marginnote{11.1} he is the best of tamers, \\
peaceful, he is the hermit among the peaceful, \\
liberated, he is the foremost of liberators, \\
crossed over, he is the most excellent of guides across.’ 

And\marginnote{12.1} so they revere him, \\

In the world with its gods, \\
he has no counterpart.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāketa}, in \textsanskrit{Kāḷaka}’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” 

“Venerable\marginnote{1.4} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“In\marginnote{2.1} this world—with its gods, \textsanskrit{Māras} and \textsanskrit{Brahmās}, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, and explored by the mind: that I know. 

In\marginnote{3.1} this world—with its gods, \textsanskrit{Māras}, and \textsanskrit{Brahmās}, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—whatever is seen, heard, thought, known, attained, sought, and explored by the mind: that I have insight into. That has been known by a Realized One, but a Realized One is not subject to it. 

If\marginnote{4.1} I were to say that ‘I do not know … the world with its gods’, I would be lying. 

If\marginnote{5.1} I were to say that ‘I both know and do not know … the world with its gods’, that would be just the same. 

If\marginnote{6.1} I were to say that ‘I neither know nor do not know … the world with its gods’, that would be my fault. 

So\marginnote{7.1} a Realized One sees what is to be seen, but does not identify with what is seen, does not identify with what is unseen, does not identify with what is to be seen, and does not identify with a seer. He hears what is to be heard, but does not identify with what is heard, does not identify with what is unheard, does not identify with what is to be heard, and does not identify with a hearer. He thinks what is to be thought, but does not identify with what is thought, does not identify with what is not thought, does not identify with what is to be thought, and does not identify with a thinker. He knows what is to be known, but does not identify with what is known, does not identify with what is unknown, does not identify with what is to be known, and does not identify with a knower. 

Since\marginnote{7.5} a Realized One is poised in the midst of things seen, heard, thought, and known, he is the poised one. And I say that there is no better or finer poise than this. 

\begin{verse}%
Such\marginnote{8.1} a one does not take anything \\
seen, heard, or thought to be ultimately true or false. \\
But others get attached, thinking it’s the truth, \\
limited by their preconceptions. 

Since\marginnote{9.1} they’ve seen this dart \\
to which people are attached and cling, \\
saying, ‘I know, I see, that’s how it is’, \\
the Realized Ones have no attachments.”

Firstly,\marginnote{1.3} a mendicant is content with any kind of robe, and praises such contentment. They don’t try to get hold of a robe in an improper way. They don’t get upset if they don’t get a robe. And if they do get a robe, they use it untied, uninfatuated, unattached, seeing the drawback, and understanding the escape. But they don’t glorify themselves or put others down on account of their contentment. A mendicant who is deft, tireless, aware, and mindful in this is said to stand in the ancient, primordial noble tradition. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{2.1} a mendicant is content with any kind of almsfood … 

Furthermore,\marginnote{3.1} a mendicant is content with any kind of lodgings … 

Furthermore,\marginnote{4.1} a mendicant enjoys meditation and loves to meditate. They enjoy giving up and love to give up. But they don’t glorify themselves or put down others on account of their love for meditation and giving up. A mendicant who is deft, tireless, aware, and mindful in this is said to stand in the ancient, primordial noble tradition. 

These\marginnote{4.4} four noble traditions are primordial, long-standing, traditional, and ancient. They are uncorrupted, as they have been since the beginning. They’re not being corrupted now nor will they be. Sensible ascetics and brahmins don’t look down on them. 

When\marginnote{5.1} a mendicant has these four noble traditions, if they live in the east they prevail over discontent, and discontent doesn’t prevail over them. If they live in the west … the north … the south, they prevail over discontent, and discontent doesn’t prevail over them. Why is that? Because a wise one prevails over desire and discontent. 

\begin{verse}%

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. 

Now\marginnote{1.2} at that time several very well-known wanderers were residing in the monastery of the wanderers on the bank of the \textsanskrit{Sappinī} river. They included \textsanskrit{Annabhāra}, Varadhara, \textsanskrit{Sakuludāyī}, and other very well-known wanderers. Then in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the wanderer’s monastery on the banks of the \textsanskrit{Sappinī} river, He sat down on the seat spread out, and said to the wanderers: 

“Wanderers,\marginnote{2.1} these four footprints of the Dhamma are primordial, long-standing, traditional, and ancient. They are uncorrupted, as they have been since the beginning. They’re not being corrupted now nor will they be. Sensible ascetics and brahmins don’t look down on them. What four?

They are uncorrupted, as they have been since the beginning. They’re not being corrupted now nor will they be. Sensible ascetics and brahmins don’t look down on them. 

Wanderers,\marginnote{3.1} if someone should say: ‘I’ll reject this Dhamma footprint of contentment, and describe a true ascetic or brahmin who covets sensual pleasures with acute lust.’ Then I’d say to them: ‘Let them come, speak, and discuss. We’ll see how powerful they are.’ It’s simply impossible to reject this Dhamma footprint of contentment, and point out a true ascetic or brahmin who covets sensual pleasures with acute lust. 

If\marginnote{4.1} someone should say: ‘I’ll reject this Dhamma footprint of good will, and describe a true ascetic or brahmin who has ill will and malicious intent.’ Then I’d say to them: ‘Let them come, speak, and discuss. We’ll see how powerful they are.’ It’s simply impossible to reject this Dhamma footprint of good will, and point out a true ascetic or brahmin who has ill will and malicious intent. 

If\marginnote{5.1} someone should say: ‘I’ll reject this Dhamma footprint of right mindfulness, and describe a true ascetic or brahmin who is unmindful, with no situational awareness.’ Then I’d say to them: ‘Let them come, speak, and discuss. We’ll see how powerful they are.’ It’s simply impossible to reject this Dhamma footprint of right mindfulness, and point out a true ascetic or brahmin who is unmindful, with no situational awareness. 

If\marginnote{6.1} someone should say: ‘I’ll reject this Dhamma footprint of right immersion, and describe a true ascetic or brahmin who is scattered, with straying mind.’ Then I’d say to them: ‘Let them come, speak, and discuss. We’ll see how powerful they are.’ It’s simply impossible to reject this Dhamma footprint of right immersion, and point out a true ascetic or brahmin who is scattered, with straying mind. 

If\marginnote{7.1} anyone imagines they can criticize and reject these four footprints of the Dhamma, they deserve rebuke and criticism on four legitimate grounds in the present life. What four? 

If\marginnote{7.3} you reject the Dhamma footprint of contentment, then you must honor and praise those ascetics and brahmins who covet sensual pleasures with acute lust. 

If\marginnote{7.4} you reject the Dhamma footprint of good will, you must honor and praise those ascetics and brahmins who have ill will and malicious intent. 

If\marginnote{7.5} you reject the Dhamma footprint of right mindfulness, then you must honor and praise those ascetics and brahmins who are unmindful, with no situational awareness. 

If\marginnote{7.6} you reject the Dhamma footprint of right immersion, you must honor and praise those ascetics and brahmins who are scattered, with straying minds. 

If\marginnote{8.1} anyone imagines they can criticize and reject these four footprints of the Dhamma, they deserve rebuke and criticism on four legitimate grounds in the present life. 

Even\marginnote{8.2} those wanderers of the past, Vassa and \textsanskrit{Bhañña} of \textsanskrit{Ukkalā}, who taught the doctrines of no-cause, inaction, and nihilism, didn’t imagine that these four footprints of the Dhamma should be criticized or rejected. Why is that? For fear of being blamed, criticized, and faulted.

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.1} towards evening the lion, king of beasts, emerges from his den, yawns, looks all around the four quarters, and roars his lion’s roar three times. Then he sets out on the hunt. And the animals who hear the roar of the lion, king of beasts, are typically filled with fear, awe, and terror. They return to their lairs, be they in a hole, the water, or a wood; and the birds take to the air. Even the royal elephants, bound with strong harnesses in the villages, towns, and capital cities, break apart their bonds, and urinate and defecate in terror as they flee here and there. That’s how powerful is the lion, king of beasts, among animals, how illustrious and mighty. 

In\marginnote{2.1} the same way, when a Realized One arises in the world—perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed—he teaches the Dhamma: ‘Such is identity, such is the origin of identity, such is the cessation of identity, such is the practice that leads to the cessation of identity.’ 

Now,\marginnote{2.3} there are gods who are long-lived, beautiful, and very happy, lasting long in their divine palaces. When they hear this teaching by the Realized One, they’re typically filled with fear, awe, and terror. ‘Oh no! It turns out we’re impermanent, though we thought we were permanent! It turns out we don’t last, though we thought we were everlasting! It turns out we’re transient, though we thought we were eternal! It turns out that we’re impermanent, not lasting, transient, and included within identity.’ 

That’s\marginnote{2.8} how powerful is the Realized One in the world with its gods, how illustrious and mighty. 

\begin{verse}%
The\marginnote{3.1} Buddha, the teacher without a peer \\
in all the world with its gods, \\
rolls forth the Wheel of Dhamma \\
from his own insight: 

identity,\marginnote{4.1} its cessation, \\
the origin of identity, \\
and the noble eightfold path \\
that leads to the stilling of suffering. 

And\marginnote{5.1} then the long-lived gods, \\
so beautiful and famous, \\
are afraid and full of terror, \\
like the other beasts when they hear a lion. 

‘We\marginnote{6.1} haven’t transcended identity! \\
It turns out we’re impermanent!’ \\
So they say when they hear the word \\
of the perfected one, free and poised.”

Fading\marginnote{3.1} away is said to be the best of all things whether conditioned or unconditioned.

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. Then \textsanskrit{Vassakāra} the brahmin, a chief minister of Magadha, went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: 

“Master\marginnote{2.1} Gotama, when someone has four qualities we describe him as a great man with great wisdom. What four? 

They\marginnote{2.3} are very learned in diverse fields of learning. 

They\marginnote{2.4} understand the meaning of diverse statements, saying: ‘This is what that statement means; that is what this statement means.’ 

They\marginnote{2.5} are mindful, able to remember and recollect what was said and done long ago. 

They\marginnote{2.6} are deft and tireless in household duties, understanding how to go about things in order to complete and organize the work. 

When\marginnote{2.7} someone has these four qualities we describe him as a great man with great wisdom. If Master Gotama agrees with me, please say so. If he disagrees, please say so.” 

“Brahmin,\marginnote{3.1} I neither agree nor disagree with you, but when someone has four qualities I describe him as a great man with great wisdom. What four? 

It’s\marginnote{3.4} when someone practices for the welfare and happiness of the people. They’ve established many people in the noble method, that is, the principles of goodness and skillfulness. 

They\marginnote{3.6} think what they want to think, and don’t think what they don’t want to think. They consider what they want to consider, and don’t consider what they don’t want to consider. Thus they have achieved mental mastery of the paths of thought. 

They\marginnote{3.9} get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty. 

They\marginnote{3.10} realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. 

Brahmin,\marginnote{3.11} I neither agree nor disagree with you, but when someone has these four qualities I describe him as a great man with great wisdom.” 

“It’s\marginnote{4.1} incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing! How well said this was by Master Gotama! And we will remember Master Gotama as someone who has these four qualities. For Master Gotama practices for the welfare and happiness of the people … Master Gotama has achieved mental mastery of the paths of thought. Master Gotama gets the four absorptions … when he wants, without trouble or difficulty. Master Gotama has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. He lives having realized it with his own insight due to the ending of defilements.” 

“Your\marginnote{5.1} words are clearly invasive and intrusive, brahmin. Nevertheless, I will answer you. For I do practice for the welfare and happiness of the people … I have achieved mental mastery of the paths of thought. I do get the four absorptions … when I want, without trouble or difficulty. I have realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. I live having realized it with my own insight due to the ending of defilements.

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was traveling along the road between \textsanskrit{Ukkaṭṭhā} and \textsanskrit{Setavyā}, as was the brahmin \textsanskrit{Doṇa}. 

\textsanskrit{Doṇa}\marginnote{1.3} saw that the Buddha’s footprints had thousand-spoked wheels, with rims and hubs, complete in every detail. It occurred to him, “It’s incredible, it’s amazing! Surely these couldn’t be the footprints of a human being?” 

The\marginnote{1.7} Buddha had left the road and sat at the root of a tree cross-legged, with his body straight and his mindfulness established right there. 

Then\marginnote{1.8} \textsanskrit{Doṇa}, following the Buddha’s footprints, saw him sitting at the tree root—impressive and inspiring, with peaceful faculties and mind, attained to the highest self-control and serenity, like an elephant with tamed, guarded, and controlled faculties. He went up to the Buddha and said to him: 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.1} might you be a god?” 

“I\marginnote{2.2} will not be a god, brahmin.” 

“Might\marginnote{2.3} you be a fairy?” 

“I\marginnote{2.4} will not be a fairy.” 

“Might\marginnote{2.5} you be a native spirit?” 

“I\marginnote{2.6} will not be a native spirit.” 

“Might\marginnote{2.7} you be a human?” 

“I\marginnote{2.8} will not be a human.” 

“When\marginnote{3.1} asked whether you might be a god, fairy, native spirit, or human, you answer that you will not be any of these. What then might you be?” 

“Brahmin,\marginnote{4.1} if I had not given up defilements I might have become a god … a fairy … a native spirit … or a human. But I have given up those defilements, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so they are unable to arise in the future. 

Suppose\marginnote{4.3} there was a blue water lily, or a pink or white lotus. Though it sprouted and grew in the water, it would rise up above the water and stand with no water clinging to it. In the same way, though I was born and grew up in the world, I live having mastered the world, unsullied by the world. 

Remember\marginnote{4.5} me, brahmin, as a Buddha. 

\begin{verse}%
I\marginnote{5.1} could have been reborn as a god, \\
or as a fairy flying through the sky. \\
I could have become a native spirit, \\
or returned as a human. \\
But I’ve ended those defilements, \\
they’re blown away and mown down. 

Like\marginnote{6.1} a graceful lotus, \\
to which water does not cling, \\
the world doesn’t cling to me, \\
and so, brahmin, I am a Buddha.”

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.1} a mendicant who has four qualities can’t decline, and has drawn near to extinguishment. What four? A mendicant is accomplished in ethics, guards the sense doors, eats in moderation, and is dedicated to wakefulness. 

And\marginnote{2.1} how is a mendicant accomplished in ethics? It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the monastic code, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. That’s how a mendicant is accomplished in ethics. 

And\marginnote{3.1} how does a mendicant guard the sense doors? When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving restraint over it. Hearing a sound with their ears … Smelling an odor with their nose … Tasting a flavor with their tongue … Feeling a touch with their body … Knowing a thought with their mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving restraint over it. That’s how a mendicant guards the sense doors. 

And\marginnote{4.1} how does a mendicant eat in moderation? It’s when a mendicant reflects properly on the food that they eat: ‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’ That’s how a mendicant eats in moderation. 

And\marginnote{5.1} how is a mendicant dedicated to wakefulness? It’s when a mendicant practices walking and sitting meditation by day, purifying their mind from obstacles. In the evening, they continue to practice walking and sitting meditation. In the middle of the night, they lie down in the lion’s posture—on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other—mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up. In the last part of the night, they get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation, purifying their mind from obstacles. This is how a mendicant is dedicated to wakefulness. A mendicant who has these four qualities can’t decline, and has drawn near to extinguishment.

And\marginnote{1.2} how has a mendicant eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth? Different ascetics and brahmins have different idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth. For example: the cosmos is eternal, or not eternal, or finite, or infinite; the soul and the body are the same thing, or they are different things; after death, a Realized One exists, or doesn’t exist, or both exists and doesn’t exist, or neither exists nor doesn’t exist. A mendicant has dispelled, eliminated, thrown out, rejected, let go of, given up, and relinquished all these. That’s how a mendicant has eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth. 

And\marginnote{2.1} how has a mendicant totally given up searching? It’s when they’ve given up searching for sensual pleasures, for continued existence, and for a spiritual path. That’s how a mendicant has totally given up searching. 

And\marginnote{3.1} how has a mendicant stilled the physical process? It’s when, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. That’s how a mendicant has stilled the physical process. 

And\marginnote{4.1} how is a mendicant withdrawn? It’s when they’ve given up the conceit ‘I am’, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future. That’s how a mendicant is withdrawn. A mendicant has eliminated idiosyncratic interpretations of the truth, has totally given up searching, has stilled the physical process, and is said to be ‘withdrawn’.

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.1} there are these four ways of developing immersion further. What four? There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to blissful meditation in the present life. There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to gaining knowledge and vision. There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to mindfulness and awareness. There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to the ending of defilements. 

And\marginnote{2.1} what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to blissful meditation in the present life? It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to blissful meditation in the present life. 

And\marginnote{3.1} what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to gaining knowledge and vision? It’s when a mendicant focuses on the perception of light, concentrating on the perception of day, regardless of whether it’s night or day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that’s full of radiance. This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to gaining knowledge and vision. 

And\marginnote{4.1} what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to mindfulness and awareness? It’s when a mendicant knows feelings as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. They know perceptions as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. They know thoughts as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to mindfulness and awareness. 

And\marginnote{5.1} what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to the ending of defilements? It’s when a mendicant meditates observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates. ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling. Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is the ending of perception. Such are choices, such is the origin of choices, such is the ending of choices. Such is consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.’ This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to the ending of defilements.

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. 

Then,\marginnote{1.2} late at night, the glorious god Rohitassa, lighting up the entire Jeta’s Grove, went up to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and said to him: 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.1} is it possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn?” 

“Reverend,\marginnote{2.2} I say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn.” 

“It’s\marginnote{3.1} incredible, sir, it’s amazing, how well said this was by the Buddha. 

Once\marginnote{4.1} upon a time, I was a hermit called Rohitassa, son of Bhoja. I was a sky-walker with psychic powers. I was as fast as a light arrow easily shot across the shadow of a palm tree by a well-trained expert archer with a strong bow. My stride was such that it could span from the eastern ocean to the western ocean. Having such speed and stride, this wish came to me: ‘I will reach the end of the world by traveling.’ I traveled for my whole lifespan of a hundred years—pausing only to eat and drink, go to the toilet, and sleep to dispel weariness—and I passed away along the way, never reaching the end of the world. 

It’s\marginnote{5.1} incredible, sir, it’s amazing, how well said this was by the Buddha.” 

“Reverend,\marginnote{6.1} I say it’s not possible to know or see or reach the end of the world by traveling to a place where there’s no being born, growing old, dying, passing away, or being reborn. But I also say there’s no making an end of suffering without reaching the end of the world. For it is in this fathom-long carcass with its perception and mind that I describe the world, its origin, its cessation, and the practice that leads to its cessation. 

\begin{verse}%
The\marginnote{7.1} end of the world can never \\
be reached by traveling. \\
But without reaching the end of the world, \\
there’s no release from suffering. 

So\marginnote{8.1} a clever person, understanding the world, \\
has completed the spiritual journey, and gone to the end of the world. \\
A peaceful one, knowing the end of the world, \\
does not long for this world or the next.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where they have a town named Pajjanika. 

Then\marginnote{1.2} the Buddha robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the home of \textsanskrit{Suppavāsā} the Koliyan, where he sat on the seat spread out. Then \textsanskrit{Suppavāsā} served and satisfied the Buddha with her own hands with a variety of delicious foods. When the Buddha had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, she sat down to one side. The Buddha said to her: 

“\textsanskrit{Suppavāsā},\marginnote{2.1} when a noble disciple gives food, she gives the recipients four things. What four? Long life, beauty, happiness, and strength. Giving long life, she has long life as a god or human. Giving beauty, she has beauty as a god or human. Giving happiness, she has happiness as a god or human. Giving strength, she has strength as a god or human. When a noble disciple gives food, she gives the recipients these four things. 

\begin{verse}%
When\marginnote{3.1} she gives well-prepared food, \\
pure, fine, and full of flavor, \\
that offering—given to the upright, \\
who have good conduct, and are big-hearted—\\
joins merit to merit. It’s very fruitful, \\
and is praised by those who know the world. 

Those\marginnote{4.1} who recall such sacrifices, \\
live in the world full of inspiration. \\
They’ve driven out the stain of stinginess, root and all, \\
blameless, they go to a heavenly place.”

Then\marginnote{1.1} the householder \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika} went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 

“Householder,\marginnote{2.1} these four things that are likable, desirable, and agreeable are hard to get in the world. What four? The first thing is the wish: ‘May wealth come to me by legitimate means!’ 

The\marginnote{3.1} second thing, having got wealth by legitimate means, is the wish: ‘May fame come to me, together with my family and teachers.’ 

The\marginnote{4.1} third thing, having got wealth and fame, is the wish: ‘May I live long, keeping alive for a long time!’ 

The\marginnote{5.1} fourth thing, having got wealth, fame, and long life, is the wish: ‘When my body breaks up, after death, may I be reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm!’ These are the four things that are likable, desirable, and agreeable, but hard to get in the world. 

These\marginnote{6.1} next four things lead to the getting of those four things. What four? Accomplishment in faith, ethics, generosity, and wisdom. 

And\marginnote{7.1} what is accomplishment in faith? It’s when a noble disciple has faith in the Realized One’s awakening: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ This is called accomplishment in faith. 

And\marginnote{8.1} what is accomplishment in ethics? It’s when a noble disciple doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit sexual misconduct, lie, or take alcoholic drinks that cause negligence. This is called accomplishment in ethics. 

And\marginnote{9.1} what is accomplishment in generosity? It’s when a noble disciple lives at home rid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, loving to let go, committed to charity, loving to give and to share. This is called accomplishment in generosity. 

And\marginnote{10.1} what is accomplishment in wisdom? When your heart is mastered by covetousness and immoral greed, you do what you shouldn’t, and fail to do what you should. Your fame and happiness fall to dust. When your heart is mastered by ill will … dullness and drowsiness … restlessness and remorse … doubt, you do what you shouldn’t, and fail to do what you should. Your fame and happiness fall to dust. 

Knowing\marginnote{11.1} that ‘covetousness and immoral greed are corruptions of the mind’, that noble disciple gives them up. Knowing that ‘ill will …’ … ‘dullness and drowsiness …’ … ‘restlessness and remorse …’ … ‘doubt is a corruption of the mind’, that noble disciple gives it up. 

When\marginnote{12.1} a noble disciple has given up these things, they’re called ‘a noble disciple of great wisdom, of widespread wisdom, who sees what matters, and is accomplished in wisdom’. This is called accomplishment in wisdom. These are the four things that lead to the getting of the four things that are likable, desirable, and agreeable, but hard to get in the world. 

There\marginnote{13.1} are four deeds of substance that a noble disciple does with the legitimate wealth he has earned by his efforts and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow. What four? 

To\marginnote{13.3} start with, with his legitimate wealth he makes himself happy and pleased, keeping himself properly happy. He makes his mother and father happy … He makes his children, partners, bondservants, workers, and staff happy … He makes his friends and colleagues happy … This is his first solid and substantive investment, used in the appropriate sphere. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{14.1} with his legitimate wealth he defends himself against threats from such things as fire, flood, rulers, bandits, or unloved heirs. He keeps himself safe. This is his second solid and substantive investment, used in the appropriate sphere. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{15.1} with his legitimate wealth he makes five spirit-offerings: to relatives, guests, ancestors, king, and deities. This is his third solid and substantive investment, used in the appropriate sphere. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{16.1} with his legitimate wealth he establishes an uplifting religious donation for ascetics and brahmins—those who avoid intoxication and negligence, are settled in patience and gentleness, and who tame, calm, and extinguish themselves—that’s conducive to heaven, ripens in happiness, and leads to heaven. This is his fourth solid and substantive investment, used in the appropriate sphere. 

These\marginnote{17.1} are the four deeds of substance that a noble disciple does with the legitimate wealth he has earned by his efforts and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow. 

Whatever\marginnote{17.2} wealth is spent on something other than these four deeds of substance is said to be not a solid or substantive investment, and not used in the appropriate sphere. But whatever wealth is spent on these four deeds of substance is said to be a solid and substantive investment, used in the appropriate sphere. 

\begin{verse}%
‘I’ve\marginnote{18.1} enjoyed my wealth, supporting those who depend on me; \\
I’ve overcome losses; \\
I’ve given uplifting religious donations; \\
and made the five spirit-offerings. \\
I have served the ethical and \\
disciplined spiritual practitioners. 

I’ve\marginnote{19.1} achieved the purpose \\
for which an astute lay person \\
wishes to gain wealth. \\
I don’t regret what I’ve done.’ 

A\marginnote{20.1} mortal person who recollects this \\
stands firm in the teaching of the noble ones. \\
They’re praised in this life, \\
and they depart to rejoice in heaven.”

Then\marginnote{1.1} the householder \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika} went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: 

“Householder,\marginnote{2.1} these four kinds of happiness can be earned by a layperson who enjoys sensual pleasures, depending on time and occasion. What four? The happiness of ownership, using wealth, debtlessness, and blamelessness. 

And\marginnote{3.1} what is the happiness of ownership? It’s when a gentleman owns legitimate wealth that he has earned by his own efforts and initiative, built up with his own hands, gathered by the sweat of the brow. When he reflects on this, he’s filled with pleasure and happiness. This is called ‘the happiness of ownership’. 

And\marginnote{4.1} what is the happiness of using wealth? It’s when a gentleman uses his legitimate wealth, and makes merit with it. When he reflects on this, he’s filled with pleasure and happiness. This is called ‘the happiness of using wealth’. 

And\marginnote{5.1} what is the happiness of debtlessness? It’s when a gentleman owes no debt, large or small, to anyone. When he reflects on this, he’s filled with pleasure and happiness. This is called ‘the happiness of debtlessness’. 

And\marginnote{6.1} what is the happiness of blamelessness? It’s when a noble disciple has blameless conduct by way of body, speech, and mind. When he reflects on this, he’s filled with pleasure and happiness. This is called ‘the happiness of blamelessness’. 

These\marginnote{6.5} four kinds of happiness can be earned by a layperson who enjoys sensual pleasures, depending on time and occasion. 

\begin{verse}%
Knowing\marginnote{7.1} the happiness of debtlessness, \\
and the extra happiness of possession, \\
a mortal enjoying the happiness of using wealth, \\
then sees clearly with wisdom.

But when led on by questions they speak well of themselves without giving the full details, leaving many things out. That’s how to know that this is a good person. A good person can be known by these four qualities. 

It’s\marginnote{9.1} like a bride on the day or night she’s first brought to her husband’s home. Right away she sets up a keen sense of conscience and prudence for her mother and father in law, her husband, and even the bondservants, workers, and staff. But after some time, because of living together and familiarity, she’ll even say to her mother and father in law, or to her husband: ‘Go away! What would you know?’ In the same way, on the day or night a mendicant first goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, right away they set up a keen sense of conscience and prudence for the monks, nuns, laymen, and laywomen, and even the monastery workers and novices. But after some time, because of living together and familiarity, they’ll even say to their teacher or mentor: ‘Go away! What would you know?’ 

So\marginnote{9.7} you should train like this: ‘We will live with hearts like that of a newly wedded bride.’ That’s how you should train.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying between a pair of sal trees in the sal forest of the Mallas at Upavattana near \textsanskrit{Kusinārā} at the time of his final extinguishment. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants, “Mendicants!” 

“Venerable\marginnote{1.4} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“Perhaps\marginnote{2.1} even a single mendicant has doubt or uncertainty regarding the Buddha, the teaching, the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}, the path, or the practice. So ask, mendicants! Don’t regret it later, thinking: ‘We were in the Teacher’s presence and we weren’t able to ask the Buddha a question.’” When this was said, the mendicants kept silent. 

For\marginnote{3.1} a second time the Buddha addressed the mendicants: … For a second time, the mendicants kept silent. 

For\marginnote{4.1} a third time the Buddha addressed the mendicants: … For a third time, the mendicants kept silent. 

Then\marginnote{5.1} the Buddha said to the mendicants: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{5.2} perhaps you don’t ask out of respect for the Teacher. So let a friend tell a friend.” When this was said, the mendicants kept silent. Then Venerable Ānanda said to the Buddha: 

“It’s\marginnote{5.5} incredible, sir, it’s amazing! I am quite confident that there’s not even a single mendicant in this \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} who has doubt or uncertainty regarding the Buddha, the teaching, the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}, the path, or the practice.” 

“Ānanda,\marginnote{6.1} you speak from faith.

And they’re ugly, unsightly, deformed, chronically ill—one-eyed, crippled, lame, or half-paralyzed.

And\marginnote{5.1} how is a person an exquisite ascetic of ascetics? It’s when a mendicant usually uses only what they’ve been invited to accept—robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick—rarely using them without invitation. When living with other spiritual practitioners, they usually treat them agreeably by way of body, speech, and mind, and rarely disagreeably. And they usually present them with agreeable things, rarely with disagreeable ones. They’re healthy, so the various unpleasant feelings—stemming from disorders of bile, phlegm, wind, or their conjunction; or caused by change in weather, by not taking care of yourself, by overexertion, or as the result of past deeds—usually don’t come up. They get the four absorptions—blissful meditations in the present life that belong to the higher mind—when they want, without trouble or difficulty. And they realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. … That’s how a person is an exquisite ascetic of ascetics. 

And\marginnote{6.1} if anyone should be rightly called an exquisite ascetic of ascetics, it’s me.

Then\marginnote{1.1} the wanderer Potaliya went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side, and the Buddha said to him:

As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}.

\textit{(This\marginnote{1.1} is a ghost sutta: there is no text for it in any available editions. However, the summary verse at the end of  the chapter (AN 4.110) mentions “two on mangoes”. The commentary notes the existence of a discourse here, but merely says that its meaning is clear. A note in the VRI edition says that there is a reading that has \textit{\textsanskrit{obhāsa}} where the previous sutta has \textit{\textsanskrit{vaṇṇa}}.) }

It’s when someone sees that the kings have arrested a bandit, a criminal, and subjected them to various punishments—whipping, caning, and clubbing; cutting off hands or feet, or both; cutting off ears or nose, or both; the ‘porridge pot’, the ‘shell-shave’, the ‘demon’s mouth’, the ‘garland of fire’, the ‘burning hand’, the ‘grass blades’, the ‘bark dress’, the ‘antelope’, the ‘meat hook’, the ‘coins’, the ‘caustic pickle’, the ‘twisting bar’, the ‘straw mat’; being splashed with hot oil, being fed to the dogs, being impaled alive, and being beheaded. 

They\marginnote{5.1} think: ‘If I were to do the same kind of bad deed, the kings would punish me in the same way.’ … Being afraid of punishment, they don’t steal the belongings of others. They give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure. This is called the fear of punishment. 

And\marginnote{6.1} what, mendicants, is the fear of rebirth in a bad place? It’s when someone reflects: ‘Bad conduct of body, speech, or mind has a bad result in the next life. If I were to do such bad things, when my body breaks up, after death, I’d be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.’ Being afraid of rebirth in a bad place, they give up bad conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, and develop good conduct by way of body, speech, and mind, keeping themselves pure. This is called the fear of rebirth in a bad place. 

These\marginnote{6.7} are the four fears.”

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.1} anyone who enters the water should anticipate four dangers. What four? The dangers of waves, marsh crocodiles, whirlpools, and gharials. 

These\marginnote{1.4} are the four dangers that anyone who enters the water should anticipate. In the same way, a gentleman who goes forth from the lay life to homelessness in this teaching and training should anticipate four dangers. What four? The dangers of waves, marsh crocodiles, whirlpools, and gharials. 

And\marginnote{2.1} what, mendicants, is the danger of waves? It’s when a gentleman has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness, thinking: ‘I’m swamped by rebirth, old age, and death; by sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress. I’m swamped by suffering, mired in suffering. Hopefully I can find an end to this entire mass of suffering.’ When they’ve gone forth, their spiritual companions advise and instruct them: ‘You should go out like this, and come back like that. You should look to the front like this, and to the side like that. You should contract your limbs like this, and extend them like that. This is how you should bear your outer robe, bowl, and robes.’ They think: ‘Formerly, as a lay person, I advised and instructed others. And now these mendicants—who you’d think were my children or grandchildren—imagine they can advise and instruct me!’ Angry and upset, they resign the training and return to a lesser life. This is called a mendicant who resigns the training and returns to a lesser life because they’re afraid of the danger of waves. ‘Danger of waves’ is a term for anger and distress. This is called the danger of waves. 

And\marginnote{3.1} what, mendicants, is the danger of marsh crocodiles? It’s when a gentleman has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness … When they’ve gone forth, their spiritual companions advise and instruct them: ‘You may eat, consume, taste, and drink these things, but not those. You may eat what’s allowable, but not what’s unallowable. You may eat at the right time, but not at the wrong time.’ They think: ‘Formerly, as a lay person, I used to eat, consume, taste, and drink what I wanted, not what I didn’t want. I ate and drank both allowable and unallowable things, at the right time and the wrong time. And these faithful householders give us a variety of delicious foods at the wrong time of day. But these mendicants imagine they can gag our mouths!’ Angry and upset, they resign the training and return to a lesser life. This is called a mendicant who resigns the training and returns to a lesser life because they’re afraid of the danger of marsh crocodiles. ‘Danger of marsh crocodiles’ is a term for gluttony. This is called the danger of marsh crocodiles. 

And\marginnote{4.1} what, mendicants, is the danger of whirlpools? It’s when a gentleman has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness … When they’ve gone forth, they robe up in the morning and, taking their bowl and robe, enter a village or town for alms without guarding body, speech, and mind, without establishing mindfulness, and without restraining the sense faculties. There they see a householder or their child amusing themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. They think: ‘Formerly, as a lay person, I amused myself, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. And it’s true that my family is wealthy. I can both enjoy my wealth and make merit. Why don’t I resign the training and return to a lesser life, so I can enjoy my wealth and make merit?’ They resign the training and return to a lesser life. This is called a mendicant who resigns the training and returns to a lesser life because they’re afraid of the danger of whirlpools. ‘Danger of whirlpools’ is a term for the five kinds of sensual stimulation. This is called the danger of whirlpools. 

And\marginnote{5.1} what, mendicants, is the danger of gharials? It’s when a gentleman has gone forth from the lay life to homelessness … When they’ve gone forth, they robe up in the morning and, taking their bowl and robe, enter a village or town for alms without guarding body, speech, and mind, without establishing mindfulness, and without restraining the sense faculties. There they see a female scantily clad, with revealing clothes. Lust infects their mind, so they resign the training and return to a lesser life. This is called a mendicant who resigns the training and returns to a lesser life because they’re afraid of the danger of gharials. ‘Danger of gharials’ is a term for females. This is called the danger of gharials. 

These\marginnote{5.12} are the four dangers that a gentleman who goes forth from the lay life to homelessness in this teaching and training should anticipate.”

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.1} these four people are found in the world. What four? 

Firstly,\marginnote{1.3} a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying. If they abide in that, are committed to it, and meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they’re reborn in the company of the gods of \textsanskrit{Brahmā}’s Host. The lifespan of the gods of Brahma’s Host is one eon. An ordinary person stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent, then they go to hell or the animal realm or the ghost realm. But a disciple of the Buddha stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent, then they’re extinguished in that very life. This is the difference between a learned noble disciple and an unlearned ordinary person, that is, when there is a place of rebirth. 

As\marginnote{2.1} the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying. If they abide in that, are committed to it, and meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they’re reborn in the company of the gods of streaming radiance. The lifespan of the gods of streaming radiance is two eons. An ordinary person stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent, then they go to hell or the animal realm or the ghost realm. But a disciple of the Buddha stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent, then they’re extinguished in that very life. This is the difference between a learned noble disciple and an unlearned ordinary person, that is, when there is a place of rebirth. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{3.1} with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying. If they abide in that, are committed to it, and meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they’re reborn in the company of the gods replete with glory. The lifespan of the gods replete with glory is four eons. An ordinary person stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent, then they go to hell or the animal realm or the ghost realm. But a disciple of the Buddha stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent, then they’re extinguished in that very life. This is the difference between a learned noble disciple and an unlearned ordinary person, that is, when there is a place of rebirth. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{4.1} giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying. If they abide in that, are committed to it, and meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they’re reborn in the company of the gods of abundant fruit. The lifespan of the gods of abundant fruit is five hundred eons. An ordinary person stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent, then they go to hell or the animal realm or the ghost realm. But a disciple of the Buddha stays there until the lifespan of those gods is spent, then they’re extinguished in that very life.

Because\marginnote{2.4} of this, they focus their corrupt wishes on being looked up to, and on getting material possessions, honor, and popularity.

\scevam{So\marginnote{1.1} I have heard. }At one time Venerable Ānanda was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. 

And\marginnote{1.3} then a certain nun addressed a man, “Please, mister, go to Venerable Ānanda, and in my name bow with your head to his feet. Say to him: ‘Sir, the nun named so-and-so is sick, suffering, and gravely ill. She bows with her head to your feet.’ And then say: ‘Sir, please go to the nuns’ quarters to visit that nun out of compassion.’” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.8} ma’am,” that man replied. He did as the nun asked. Ānanda consented in silence. 

Then\marginnote{3.1} Ānanda robed up and went to the nuns’ quarters to visit that nun, taking his bowl and robe. That nun saw Ānanda coming off in the distance. She wrapped herself up from head to foot and laid down on her cot. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to her, and sat down on the seat spread out. Then Ānanda said to the nun: 

“Sister,\marginnote{4.1} this body is produced by food. Relying on food, you should give up food. This body is produced by craving. Relying on craving, you should give up craving. This body is produced by conceit. Relying on conceit, you should give up conceit. This body is produced by sex. The Buddha spoke of breaking off everything to do with sex. 

‘This\marginnote{5.1} body is produced by food. Relying on food, you should give up food.’ This is what I said, but why did I say it? Take a mendicant who reflects properly on the food that they eat: ‘Not for fun, indulgence, adornment, or decoration, but only to sustain this body, to avoid harm, and to support spiritual practice. In this way, I shall put an end to old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort, and I will live blamelessly and at ease.’ After some time, relying on food, they give up food. That’s why I said what I said. 

‘This\marginnote{6.1} body is produced by craving. Relying on craving, you should give up craving.’ This is what I said, but why did I say it? Take a mendicant who hears this: ‘They say that the mendicant named so-and-so has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ They think: ‘Oh, when will I too realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. …’ After some time, relying on craving, they give up craving. That's why I said what I said. 

‘This\marginnote{7.1} body is produced by conceit. Relying on conceit, you should give up conceit.’ This is what I said, but why did I say it? Take a mendicant who hears this: ‘They say that the mendicant named so-and-so has realized the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements.’ They think: ‘Well, that venerable can realize the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. … Why can’t I?’ After some time, relying on conceit, they give up conceit. That’s why I said what I said. 

‘This\marginnote{8.1} body is produced by sex. The Buddha spoke of breaking off everything to do with sex.’” 

Then\marginnote{9.1} that nun rose from her cot, placed her robe over one shoulder, bowed with her head at Ānanda’s feet, and said, “I have made a mistake, sir. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of me to act in that way. Please, sir, accept my mistake for what it is, so I can restrain myself in future.” 

“Indeed,\marginnote{9.4} sister, you made a mistake. It was foolish, stupid, and unskillful of you to act in that way. But since you have recognized your mistake for what it is, and have dealt with it properly, I accept it. For it is growth in the training of the Noble One to recognize a mistake for what it is, deal with it properly, and commit to restraint in the future.”

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.1} a Holy One or a Holy One’s training remain in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans. 

And\marginnote{2.1} who is a Holy One? It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. This is a Holy One. 

And\marginnote{3.1} what is the training of a Holy One? He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. This is the training of a Holy One. This is how a Holy One or a Holy One’s training remain in the world for the welfare and happiness of the people, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans. 

These\marginnote{4.1} four things lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching. What four? 

Firstly,\marginnote{4.3} the mendicants memorize discourses that they learned incorrectly, with misplaced words and phrases. When the words and phrases are misplaced, the meaning is misinterpreted. This is the first thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{5.1} the mendicants are hard to admonish, having qualities that make them hard to admonish. They’re impatient, and don’t take instruction respectfully. This is the second thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{6.1} the mendicants who are very learned—knowledgeable in the scriptures, who have memorized the teachings, the monastic law, and the outlines—don’t carefully make others recite the discourses. When they pass away, the discourses are cut off at the root, with no-one to preserve them. This is the third thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{7.1} the senior mendicants are indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, not rousing energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized. Those who come after them follow their example. They too become indulgent and slack, leaders in backsliding, neglecting seclusion, not rousing energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized. This is the fourth thing that leads to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching. 

These\marginnote{7.5} are four things that lead to the decline and disappearance of the true teaching. 

These\marginnote{8.1} four things lead to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching. What four? 

Firstly,\marginnote{8.3} the mendicants memorize discourses that have been learned correctly, with well placed words and phrases. When the words and phrases are well placed, the meaning is interpreted correctly. This is the first thing that leads to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{9.1} the mendicants are easy to admonish, having qualities that make them easy to admonish. They’re patient, and take instruction respectfully. This is the second thing that leads to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{10.1} the mendicants who are very learned—knowledgeable in the scriptures, who have memorized the teachings, the monastic law, and the outlines—carefully make others recite the discourses. When they pass away, the discourses aren’t cut off at the root, and they have someone to preserve them. This is the third thing that leads to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{11.1} the senior mendicants are not indulgent or slack, nor are they backsliders; instead, they take the lead in seclusion, rousing energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized. Those who come after them follow their example. They too aren’t indulgent or slack … This is the fourth thing that leads to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching. 

These\marginnote{11.5} are four things that lead to the continuation, persistence, and enduring of the true teaching.”

It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. They rely on these five powers of a trainee: faith, conscience, prudence, energy, and wisdom. But these five faculties manifest in them weakly: faith, energy, mindfulness, immersion, and wisdom.

“Reverend,”\marginnote{1.5} they replied. Ānanda said this: 

“Reverends,\marginnote{2.1} all of the monks and nuns who declare in my presence that they have attained perfection, did so by one or other of four paths. 

What\marginnote{3.1} four? 

Take\marginnote{3.2} a mendicant who develops serenity before discernment. As they do so, the path is born in them. They cultivate, develop, and make much of it. By doing so, they give up the fetters and eliminate the underlying tendencies. 

Another\marginnote{4.1} mendicant develops discernment before serenity. As they do so, the path is born in them. They cultivate, develop, and make much of it. By doing so, they give up the fetters and eliminate the underlying tendencies. 

Another\marginnote{5.1} mendicant develops serenity and discernment in conjunction. As they do so, the path is born in them. They cultivate, develop, and make much of it. By doing so, they give up the fetters and eliminate the underlying tendencies. 

Another\marginnote{6.1} mendicant’s mind is seized by restlessness to realize the teaching. But there comes a time when their mind is stilled internally; it settles, unifies, and becomes immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi}. The path is born in them.

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.1} as long as there’s a body, the intention that gives rise to bodily action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself. As long as there’s a voice, the intention that gives rise to verbal action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself. As long as there’s a mind, the intention that gives rise to mental action causes pleasure and pain to arise in oneself. But these only apply when conditioned by ignorance. 

By\marginnote{2.1} oneself one makes the choice that gives rise to bodily, verbal, and mental action, conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself. Or else others make the choice … One consciously makes the choice … Or else one unconsciously makes the choice … 

Ignorance\marginnote{5.1} is included in all these things. But when ignorance fades away and ceases with nothing left over, there is no body and no voice and no mind, conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself. There is no field, no ground, no scope, and no basis, conditioned by which that pleasure and pain arise in oneself. 

Mendicants,\marginnote{6.1} there are four kinds of reincarnation. What four? 

\begin{enumerate}%
\item There is a reincarnation where one’s own intention is effective, not that of others. %

\item There is a reincarnation where neither one’s own nor others’ intentions are effective. %
\end{enumerate}

These\marginnote{6.7} are the four kinds of reincarnation.” 

When\marginnote{7.1} he said this, Venerable \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} said to the Buddha: 

“Sir,\marginnote{7.2} this is how I understand the detailed meaning of the Buddha’s brief statement. Take the case of the reincarnation where one’s own intention is effective, not that of others. Those sentient beings pass away from that realm due to their own intention. Take the case of the reincarnation where the intention of others is effective, not one’s own. Those sentient beings pass away from that realm due to the intention of others. Take the case of the reincarnation where both one’s own and others’ intentions are effective. Those sentient beings pass away from that realm due to both their own and others’ intentions. But sir, in the case of the reincarnation where neither one’s own nor others’ intentions are effective, what kind of gods does this refer to?” 

“\textsanskrit{Sāriputta},\marginnote{7.7} it refers to the gods reborn in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.” 

“What\marginnote{8.1} is the cause, sir, what is the reason why some sentient beings pass away from that realm as returners who come back to this state of existence, while others are non-returners who don’t come back?” 

“\textsanskrit{Sāriputta},\marginnote{8.3} take a person who hasn’t given up the lower fetters. In the present life they enter and abide in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying. If they abide in that, are committed to it, and meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they’re reborn in the company of the gods of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. When they pass away from there, they’re a returner, who comes back to this state of existence. 

\textsanskrit{Sāriputta},\marginnote{9.1} take a person who has given up the lower fetters. In the present life they enter and abide in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. They enjoy it and like it and find it satisfying. If they abide in that, are committed to it, and meditate on it often without losing it, when they die they’re reborn in the company of the gods of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. When they pass away from there, they’re a non-returner, not coming back to this state of existence.

When I depart, I’ll go to the place where people who’ve done such things go.’ They sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion.

When they fall seriously ill, they don’t think: ‘The sensual pleasures that I love so much will leave me, and I’ll leave them.’ They don’t sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. This is someone who’s not frightened of death. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{8.1} it’s someone who is rid of greed, desire, fondness, thirst, passion, and craving for the body. When they fall seriously ill, they don’t think: ‘This body that I love so much will leave me, and I’ll leave it.’ They don’t sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. This, too, is someone who’s not frightened of death. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{9.1} it’s someone who hasn’t done bad, violent, and corrupt deeds, but has done good and skillful deeds that keep them safe. When they fall seriously ill, they think: ‘Well, I haven’t done bad, violent, and depraved things. And I have done good and skillful deeds that keep me safe. When I depart, I’ll go to the place where people who’ve done such things go.’ They don’t sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. This, too, is someone who’s not frightened of death. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{10.1} it’s someone who’s not doubtful, uncertain, or undecided about the true teaching. When they fall seriously ill, they think: ‘I’m not doubtful, uncertain, or undecided about the true teaching.’ They don’t sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. This, too, is someone who’s not frightened of death. 

These\marginnote{10.7} are the four people liable to death who are not frightened and terrified of death.” 

“Excellent,\marginnote{11.1} Master Gotama! … From this day forth, may Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

Once\marginnote{1.1} the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. 

Now\marginnote{1.2} at that time several very well-known wanderers were residing in the monastery of the wanderers on the bank of the \textsanskrit{Sappinī} river. They included \textsanskrit{Annabhāra}, Varadhara, \textsanskrit{Sakuludāyī}, and other very well-known wanderers. 

Then\marginnote{1.3} in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the wanderer’s monastery on the bank of the \textsanskrit{Sappinī} river. 

Now\marginnote{2.1} at that time this discussion came up while those wanderers who follow other paths were sitting together, “The truths of the brahmins are like this; the truths of the brahmins are like that.” 

Then\marginnote{2.3} the Buddha went up to those wanderers, sat down on the seat spread out, and said to them, “Wanderers, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?” 

“Well,\marginnote{3.2} Master Gotama, this discussion came up among us while we were sitting together: ‘The truths of the brahmins are like this; the truths of the brahmins are like that.’” 

“Wanderers,\marginnote{4.1} I declare these four truths of the brahmins, having realized them with my own insight. What four? 

Take\marginnote{4.3} a brahmin who says: ‘No sentient beings should be killed.’ Saying this, a brahmin speaks the truth, not lies. But they don’t think of themselves as an ‘ascetic’ or ‘brahmin’ because of that. Nor do they think ‘I’m better’ or ‘I’m equal’ or ‘I’m worse’. Rather, they simply practice out of kindness and compassion for living creatures, having had insight into the truth of that. 

Take\marginnote{5.1} another brahmin who says: ‘All sensual pleasures are impermanent, suffering, and perishable.’ Saying this, a brahmin speaks the truth, not lies. But they don’t think of themselves as an ‘ascetic’ or ‘brahmin’ because of that. Nor do they think ‘I’m better’ or ‘I’m equal’ or ‘I’m worse’. Rather, they simply practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding sensual pleasures, having had insight into the truth of that. 

Take\marginnote{6.1} another brahmin who says: ‘All states of existence are impermanent, suffering, and perishable.’ … They simply practice for disillusionment, dispassion, and cessation regarding future lives, having had insight into the truth of that. 

Take\marginnote{7.1} another brahmin who says: ‘I don’t belong to anyone anywhere. And nothing belongs to me anywhere.’ Saying this, a brahmin speaks the truth, not lies. But they don’t think of themselves as an ‘ascetic’ or ‘brahmin’ because of that. Nor do they think ‘I’m better’ or ‘I’m equal’ or ‘I’m worse’. Rather, they simply practice the path of nothingness, having had insight into the truth of that. 

These\marginnote{7.6} are the four truths of the brahmins that I declare, having realized them with my own insight.”

Then\marginnote{1.1} one of the mendicants went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 

“Sir,\marginnote{1.2} what leads the world on? What drags it around? What arises and takes control?” 

“Good,\marginnote{2.1} good, mendicant! Your approach and articulation are excellent, and it’s a good question. For you asked: ‘What leads the world on? What drags it around? What arises and takes control?’” 

“Yes,\marginnote{2.5} sir.” 

“Mendicant,\marginnote{2.6} the mind leads the world on. The mind drags it around. When the mind arises, it takes control.” 

Saying\marginnote{3.1} “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question: 

“Sir,\marginnote{3.2} they speak of ‘a learned memorizer of the teaching’. How is a learned memorizer of the teaching defined?” 

“Good,\marginnote{4.1} good, mendicant! Your approach and articulation are excellent, and it’s a good question. … I have taught many teachings: statements, songs, discussions, verses, inspired exclamations, legends, stories of past lives, amazing stories, and classifications. But if anyone understands the meaning and the text of even a four-line verse, and if they practice in line with that teaching, they’re qualified to be called a ‘learned memorizer of the teaching’.” 

Saying\marginnote{5.1} “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question: 

“Sir,\marginnote{5.2} they speak of ‘a learned person with penetrating wisdom’. How is a learned person with penetrating wisdom defined?” 

“Good,\marginnote{6.1} good, mendicant! Your approach and articulation are excellent, and it’s a good question. … Take a mendicant who has heard: ‘This is suffering.’ They see what it means with penetrating wisdom. They’ve heard: ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’ They see what it means with penetrating wisdom. That’s how a person is learned, with penetrating wisdom.” 

Saying\marginnote{7.1} “Good, sir”, that mendicant approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. Then he asked another question: 

“Sir,\marginnote{7.2} they speak of ‘an astute person with great wisdom’. How is an astute person with great wisdom defined?” 

“Good,\marginnote{8.1} good, mendicant! Your approach and articulation are excellent, and it’s a good question. … An astute person with great wisdom is one who has no intention to hurt themselves, or to hurt others, or to hurt both. When they think, they only think of the benefit for themselves, for others, for both, and for the whole world. That’s how a person is astute, with great wisdom.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. 

Then\marginnote{1.2} \textsanskrit{Vassakāra} the brahmin, a chief minister of Magadha, went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha: 

“Master\marginnote{2.1} Gotama, could a bad person know of a bad person: ‘This fellow is a bad person’?” 

“That’s\marginnote{2.3} impossible, brahmin, it can’t happen.” 

“Could\marginnote{2.5} a bad person know of a good person: ‘This fellow is a good person’?” 

“That\marginnote{2.7} too is impossible, it can’t happen.” 

“Master\marginnote{2.9} Gotama, could a good person know of a good person: ‘This fellow is a good person’?” 

“That,\marginnote{2.11} brahmin, is possible.” 

“Could\marginnote{2.13} a good person know of a bad person: ‘This fellow is a bad person’?” 

“That\marginnote{2.15} too is possible.” 

“It’s\marginnote{3.1} incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing, how well said this was by Master Gotama: ‘It’s impossible, it can’t happen, that a bad person could know … But it is possible that a good person could know …’ 

Once,\marginnote{4.1} members of the brahmin Todeyya’s assembly were going on complaining about others: ‘This King \textsanskrit{Eḷeyya} is a fool to be so devoted to \textsanskrit{Rāmaputta}. He even shows him the utmost deference by bowing down to him, rising up for him, greeting him with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for him. And these king’s men are fools too—Yamaka, Moggalla, Ugga, \textsanskrit{Nāvindakī}, Gandhabba, and Aggivessa—for they show the same kind of deference to \textsanskrit{Rāmaputta}.’ Then the brahmin Todeyya reasoned with them like this: ‘What do you think, sirs? When it comes to the various duties and speeches, isn’t King \textsanskrit{Eḷeyya} astute, even better than the experts?’ ‘That’s true, sir.’ 

‘It’s\marginnote{5.1} because \textsanskrit{Rāmaputta} is even more astute and expert than King \textsanskrit{Eḷeyya} that the king is so devoted to him. That’s why he even shows \textsanskrit{Rāmaputta} the utmost deference by bowing down to him, rising up for him, greeting him with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for him. 

What\marginnote{6.1} do you think, sirs? When it comes to the various duties and speeches, aren’t the king’s men—Yamaka, Moggalla, Ugga, \textsanskrit{Nāvindakī}, Gandhabba, and Aggivessa—astute, even better than the experts?’ ‘That’s true, sir.’ 

‘It’s\marginnote{7.1} because \textsanskrit{Rāmaputta} is even more astute and expert than the king’s men that they have such devotion to him. … It’s because \textsanskrit{Rāmaputta} is even more astute and expert than King \textsanskrit{Eḷeyya} that the king is so devoted to him. That’s why he even shows \textsanskrit{Rāmaputta} the utmost deference by bowing down to him, rising up for him, greeting him with joined palms, and observing proper etiquette for him.’ 

It’s\marginnote{8.1} incredible, Master Gotama, it’s amazing, how well said this was by Master Gotama: ‘It’s impossible, it can’t happen, that a bad person could know … But it is possible that a good person could know … Well, now, Master Gotama, I must go. I have many duties, and much to do.” 

“Please,\marginnote{8.13} brahmin, go at your convenience.” 

Then\marginnote{9.1} \textsanskrit{Vassakāra} the brahmin, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, got up from his seat and left.

Once\marginnote{1.1} the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Rājagaha}, on the Vulture’s Peak Mountain. Then Upaka the son of \textsanskrit{Maṇḍikā} went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.1} this is my doctrine and view: ‘Whoever goes on complaining about others without giving any reasons is reprehensible and at fault.’” 

“Upaka,\marginnote{2.4} if someone goes on complaining about others without giving a reason, they’re reprehensible and at fault. But that’s what you do, so you’re reprehensible and at fault!” 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.6} like a fish caught in a big trap just as it rises, so the Buddha caught me in a big trap of words just as I rose up.” 

“Upaka,\marginnote{3.1} I’ve declared: ‘This is unskillful.’ And there are limitless words, phrases, and teachings of the Realized One about that: ‘This is another way of saying that this is unskillful.’ I’ve declared: ‘The unskillful should be given up.’ And there are limitless words, phrases, and teachings of the Realized One about that: ‘This is another way of saying that the unskillful should be given up.’ 

I’ve\marginnote{4.1} declared that: ‘This is skillful.’ And there are limitless words, phrases, and teachings of the Realized One about that: ‘This is another way of saying that this is skillful.’ I’ve declared: ‘The skillful should be developed.’ And there are limitless words, phrases, and teachings of the Realized One about that: ‘This is another way of saying that the skillful should be developed.’” 

And\marginnote{5.1} then Upaka son of \textsanskrit{Maṇḍikā} approved and agreed with what the Buddha said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he went up to King \textsanskrit{Ajātasattu} Vedehiputta of Magadha. He told the King of all they had discussed. 

But\marginnote{5.2} \textsanskrit{Ajātasattu} became angry and upset, and said to Upaka, “How rude of this salt-maker’s boy! How scurrilous and impudent of him to imagine he could attack the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha! Get out, Upaka, go away! Don’t let me see you again.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of \textsanskrit{Migāra}’s mother. 

Now,\marginnote{1.2} at that time it was the sabbath, and the Buddha was sitting surrounded by the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of monks. Then the Buddha looked around the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of monks, who were so very silent. He addressed them: 

“This\marginnote{2.1} assembly has no nonsense, mendicants, it’s free of nonsense. It consists purely of the essential core. Such is this \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} of monks, such is this assembly! An assembly such as this is rarely seen in the world. An assembly such as this is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a religious donation, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world. Even a small gift to an assembly such as this is plentiful, while giving more is even more plentiful. An assembly such as this is worth traveling many leagues to see, even if you have to carry your own provisions in a shoulder bag. 

There\marginnote{3.1} are monks staying in this \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} who have attained to the gods. There are monks staying in this \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} who have attained to \textsanskrit{Brahmā}. There are monks staying in this \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} who have attained to the imperturbable. There are monks staying in this \textsanskrit{Saṅgha} who have attained to nobility. 

And\marginnote{4.1} how has a monk attained to the gods? It’s when a monk, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption … That’s how a monk has attained to the gods. 

And\marginnote{5.1} how has a monk attained to \textsanskrit{Brahmā}? Firstly, a monk meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Furthermore, a monk meditates spreading a heart full of compassion … rejoicing … equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world—abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. That’s how a monk has attained to \textsanskrit{Brahmā}. 

And\marginnote{6.1} how has a monk attained to the imperturbable? It’s when a monk—going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity—aware that ‘space is infinite’, enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite’, he enters and remains in the dimension of infinite consciousness. Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing at all’, he enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness. Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, he enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. That’s how a monk has attained to the imperturbable. 

And\marginnote{7.1} how has a monk attained to nobility? It’s when they truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. That’s how a monk has attained to nobility.”

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.1} these four things can be known in four situations. What four? 

You\marginnote{1.3} can get to know a person’s ethics by living with them. But only after a long time, not casually; only when paying attention, not when inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless. 

You\marginnote{1.4} can get to know a person’s purity by dealing with them. … 

You\marginnote{1.5} can get to know a person’s resilience in times of trouble. … 

You\marginnote{1.6} can get to know a person’s wisdom by discussion. But only after a long time, not casually; only when paying attention, not when inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless. 

‘You\marginnote{2.1} can get to know a person’s ethics by living with them. But only after a long time, not casually; only when paying attention, not when inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? Take a person who’s living with someone else. They come to know: ‘For a long time this venerable’s deeds have been broken, tainted, spotty, and marred. Their deeds and behavior are inconsistent. This venerable is unethical, not ethical.’ 

Take\marginnote{3.1} another person who’s living with someone else. They come to know: ‘For a long time this venerable’s deeds have been unbroken, impeccable, spotless, and unmarred. Their deeds and behavior are consistent. This venerable is ethical, not unethical.’ That’s why I said that you can get to know a person’s ethics by living with them. But only after a long time, not a short time; only when paying attention, not when inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless. 

‘You\marginnote{4.1} can get to know a person’s purity by dealing with them. …’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? Take a person who has dealings with someone else. They come to know: ‘This venerable deals with one person in one way. Then they deal with two, three, or many people each in different ways. They’re not consistent from one deal to the next. This venerable’s dealings are impure, not pure.’ 

Take\marginnote{5.1} another person who has dealings with someone else. They come to know: ‘This venerable deals with one person in one way. Then they deal with two, three, or many people each in the same way. They’re consistent from one deal to the next. This venerable’s dealings are pure, not impure.’ That’s why I said that you can get to know a person’s purity by dealing with them. … 

‘You\marginnote{6.1} can get to know a person’s resilience in times of trouble. …’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? Take a person who experiences loss of family, wealth, or health. But they don’t reflect: ‘The world’s like that. Reincarnation’s like that. That’s why the eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world revolves around the eight worldly conditions: gain and loss, fame and disgrace, blame and praise, pleasure and pain.’ They sorrow and wail and lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. 

Take\marginnote{7.1} another person who experiences loss of family, wealth, or health. But they reflect: ‘The world’s like that. Reincarnation’s like that. That’s why the eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world revolves around the eight worldly conditions: gain and loss, fame and disgrace, blame and praise, pleasure and pain.’ They don’t sorrow or wail or lament, beating their breast and falling into confusion. That’s why I said that you can get to know a person’s resilience in times of trouble. … 

‘You\marginnote{8.1} can get to know a person’s wisdom by discussion. But only after a long time, not casually; only when paying attention, not when inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless.’ That’s what I said, but why did I say it? Take a person who is discussing with someone else. They come to know: ‘Judging by this venerable’s approach, by what they’re getting at, and by how they discuss a question, they’re witless, not wise. Why is that? This venerable does not utter a deep and meaningful saying that is peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute. When this venerable speaks on Dhamma they’re not able to explain the meaning, either briefly or in detail. They can’t teach it, assert it, establish it, clarify it, analyze it, or reveal it. This venerable is witless, not wise.’ 

Suppose\marginnote{9.1} a person with good eyesight was standing on the bank of a lake. They’d see a little fish rising, and think: ‘Judging by this fish’s approach, by the ripples it makes, and by its force, it’s a little fish, not a big one.’ In the same way, a person who is discussing with someone else would come to know: ‘Judging by this venerable’s approach, by what they’re getting at, and by how they discuss a question, they’re witless, not wise. …’ 

Take\marginnote{10.1} another person who is discussing with someone else. They come to know: ‘Judging by this venerable’s approach, by what they’re getting at, and by how they discuss a question, they’re wise, not witless. Why is that? This venerable utters a deep and meaningful saying that is peaceful, sublime, beyond the scope of logic, subtle, comprehensible to the astute. When this venerable speaks on Dhamma they’re able to explain the meaning, either briefly or in detail. They teach it, assert it, establish it, clarify it, analyze it, and reveal it. This venerable is wise, not witless.’ 

Suppose\marginnote{11.1} a man with good eyesight was standing on the bank of a lake. He’d see a big fish rising, and think: ‘Judging by this fish’s approach, by the ripples it makes, and by its force, it’s a big fish, not a little one.’ In the same way, a person who is discussing with someone else would come to know: ‘Judging by this venerable’s approach, by what they’re getting at, and by how they articulate a question, they’re wise, not witless. …’ 

That’s\marginnote{12.1} why I said that you can get to know a person’s wisdom by discussion. But only after a long time, not casually; only when paying attention, not when inattentive; and only by the wise, not the witless. 

These\marginnote{12.2} are the four things that can be known in four situations.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Vesālī}, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then Bhaddiya the Licchavi went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.1} I have heard this: ‘The ascetic Gotama is a magician. He knows a conversion magic, and uses it to convert the disciples of those who follow other paths.’ I trust that those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and do not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?” 

“Please,\marginnote{3.1} Bhaddiya, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But when you know for yourselves: ‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering’, then you should give them up. 

What\marginnote{4.1} do you think, Bhaddiya? Does greed come up in a person for their welfare or harm?” 

“Harm,\marginnote{4.3} sir.” 

“A\marginnote{4.4} greedy individual—overcome by greed—kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{4.5} sir.” 

“What\marginnote{5.1} do you think, Bhaddiya? Does hate … or delusion … or aggression come up in a person for their welfare or harm?” 

“Harm,\marginnote{5.3} sir.” 

“An\marginnote{5.4} aggressive individual kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{5.5} sir.” 

“What\marginnote{6.1} do you think, Bhaddiya, are these things skillful or unskillful?” 

“Unskillful,\marginnote{6.2} sir.” 

“Blameworthy\marginnote{6.3} or blameless?” 

“Blameworthy,\marginnote{6.4} sir.” 

“Criticized\marginnote{6.5} or praised by sensible people?” 

“Criticized\marginnote{6.6} by sensible people, sir.” 

“When\marginnote{6.7} you undertake them, do they lead to harm and suffering, or not? Or how do you see this?” 

“When\marginnote{6.9} you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering. That’s how we see it.” 

“So,\marginnote{7.1} Bhaddiya, when we said: ‘Please, Bhaddiya, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think “The ascetic is our respected teacher.” But when you know for yourselves: “These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering”, then you should give them up.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. 

Please,\marginnote{8.1} Bhaddiya, don’t rely on oral transmission … But when you know for yourselves: ‘These things are skillful, blameless, praised by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness’, then you should acquire them and keep them. 

What\marginnote{9.1} do you think, Bhaddiya? Does contentment … love … understanding … benevolence come up in a person for their welfare or harm?” 

“Welfare,\marginnote{10.2} sir.” 

“An\marginnote{10.3} individual who is benevolent—not overcome by aggression—doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie, or encourage others to do the same. Is that for their lasting welfare and happiness?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{10.4} sir.” 

“What\marginnote{11.1} do you think, Bhaddiya, are these things skillful or unskillful?” 

“Skillful,\marginnote{11.2} sir.” 

“Blameworthy\marginnote{11.3} or blameless?” 

“Blameless,\marginnote{11.4} sir.” 

“Criticized\marginnote{11.5} or praised by sensible people?” 

“Praised\marginnote{11.6} by sensible people, sir.” 

“When\marginnote{11.7} you undertake them, do they lead to welfare and happiness, or not? Or how do you see this?” 

“When\marginnote{11.9} you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness. That’s how we see it.” 

“So,\marginnote{12.1} Bhaddiya, when we said: ‘Please, Bhaddiya, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think “The ascetic is our respected teacher.” But when you know for yourselves: “These things are skillful, blameless, praised by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to welfare and happiness”, then you should acquire them and keep them.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it. 

The\marginnote{13.1} good people in the world encourage their disciples: ‘Please, mister, live rid of greed. Then you won’t act out of greed by way of body, speech, or mind. Live rid of hate … delusion … aggression. Then you won’t act out of hate … delusion … aggression by way of body, speech, or mind.” 

When\marginnote{14.1} he said this, Bhaddiya the Licchavi said to the Buddha, “Excellent, sir! … From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” 

“Well,\marginnote{15.1} Bhaddiya, did I say to you: ‘Please, Bhaddiya, be my disciple, and I will be your teacher’?” 

“No,\marginnote{15.4} sir.” 

“Though\marginnote{15.5} I speak and explain like this, certain ascetics and brahmins misrepresent me with the false, hollow, lying, untruthful claim: ‘The ascetic Gotama is a magician. He knows a conversion magic, and uses it to convert the disciples of those who follow other paths.’” 

“Sir,\marginnote{15.7} this conversion magic is excellent. This conversion magic is lovely! If my loved ones—relatives and kin—were to be converted by this, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness. If all the aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers were to be converted by this, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness.” 

“That’s\marginnote{16.1} so true, Bhaddiya! That’s so true, Bhaddiya! If all the aristocrats, brahmins, merchants, and workers were to be converted by this, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness. If the whole world—with its gods, \textsanskrit{Māras} and \textsanskrit{Brahmās}, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—were to be converted by this, for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness. If these great sal trees were to be converted by this, for giving up unskillful qualities and embracing skillful qualities, it would be for their lasting welfare and happiness—if they were sentient. How much more then a human being!”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time Venerable Ānanda was staying in the land of the Koliyans, where they have a town named \textsanskrit{Sāpūga}. Then several Koliyans from \textsanskrit{Sāpūga} went up to Ānanda, bowed, and sat down to one side. Then Venerable Ānanda said to them: 

“Byagghapajjas,\marginnote{2.1} these four factors of trying to be pure have been rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment. What four? The factors of trying to be pure in ethics, mind, view, and freedom. 

And\marginnote{3.1} what is the factor of trying to be pure in ethics? It’s when a mendicant is ethical, restrained in the code of conduct, conducting themselves well and seeking alms in suitable places. Seeing danger in the slightest fault, they keep the rules they’ve undertaken. This is called purity of ethics. They think: ‘I will fulfill such purity of ethics, or, if it’s already fulfilled, I’ll support it in every situation by wisdom.’ Their enthusiasm for that—their effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness—is called the factor of trying to be pure in ethics. 

And\marginnote{4.1} what is the factor of trying to be pure in mind? It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. This is called purity of mind. They think: ‘I will fulfill such purity of mind, or, if it’s already fulfilled, I’ll support it in every situation by wisdom.’ Their enthusiasm for that—their effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness—is called the factor of trying to be pure in mind. 

And\marginnote{5.1} what is the factor of trying to be pure in view? Take a mendicant who truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. This is called purity of view. They think: ‘I will fulfill such purity of view, or, if it’s already fulfilled, I’ll support it in every situation by wisdom.’ Their enthusiasm for that—their effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness—is called the factor of trying to be pure in view. 

And\marginnote{6.1} what is the factor of trying to be pure in freedom? That noble disciple—who has these factors of trying to be pure in ethics, mind, and view—detaches their mind from things that arouse greed, and frees their mind from things that it should be freed from. Doing so, they experience perfect freedom. This is called purity of freedom. They think: ‘I will fulfill such purity of freedom, or, if it’s already fulfilled, I’ll support it in every situation by wisdom.’ Their enthusiasm for that—their effort, zeal, vigor, perseverance, mindfulness, and situational awareness—is called the factor of trying to be pure in freedom. 

These\marginnote{7.1} four factors of trying to be pure have been rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Sakyans, near Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Monastery. Then Vappa of the Sakyans, a disciple of the Jains, went up to Venerable \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna}, bowed, and sat down to one side. \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna} said to him: 

“Vappa,\marginnote{2.1} take a person who is restrained in body, speech, and mind. When ignorance fades away and knowledge arises, do you see any reason why defilements giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in the next life?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.3} I do see such a case. Take a person who did bad deeds in a past life. But the result of that has not yet ripened. For this reason defilements giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in the next life.” But this conversation between \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna} and Vappa was left unfinished. 

Then\marginnote{3.1} in the late afternoon, the Buddha came out of retreat and went to the assembly hall. He sat down on the seat spread out, and said to \textsanskrit{Mahāmoggallāna}, “\textsanskrit{Moggallāna}, what were you sitting talking about just now? What conversation was left unfinished?” 

\textsanskrit{Moggallāna}\marginnote{4.2} repeated the entire conversation to the Buddha, and concluded: “This was my conversation with Vappa that was unfinished when the Buddha arrived.” 

Then\marginnote{5.1} the Buddha said to Vappa, “Vappa, we can discuss this. But only if you allow what should be allowed, and reject what should be rejected. And if you ask me the meaning of anything you don’t understand, saying: ‘Sir, why is this? What’s the meaning of that?’” 

“Sir,\marginnote{5.4} let us discuss this. I will do as you say.” 

“What\marginnote{6.1} do you think, Vappa? There are distressing and feverish defilements that arise because of instigating bodily activity. These don’t occur in someone who avoids such bodily activity. They don’t perform any new deeds, and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by little. This wearing away is visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves. Do you see any reason why defilements giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in the next life?” 

“No,\marginnote{6.5} sir.” 

“What\marginnote{7.1} do you think, Vappa? There are distressing and feverish defilements that arise because of instigating verbal activity. These don’t occur in someone who avoids such verbal activity. They don’t perform any new deeds, and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by little. This wearing away is visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves. Do you see any reason why defilements giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in the next life?” 

“No,\marginnote{7.6} sir.” 

“What\marginnote{8.1} do you think, Vappa? There are distressing and feverish defilements that arise because of instigating mental activity. These don’t occur in someone who avoids such mental activity. They don’t perform any new deeds, and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by little. This wearing away is visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves. Do you see any reason why defilements giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in the next life?” 

“No,\marginnote{8.6} sir.” 

“What\marginnote{9.1} do you think, Vappa? There are distressing and feverish defilements that arise because of ignorance. These don’t occur when ignorance fades away and knowledge arises. They don’t perform any new deeds, and old deeds are eliminated by experiencing their results little by little. This wearing away is visible in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves. Do you see any reason why defilements giving rise to painful feelings would defile that person in the next life?” 

“No,\marginnote{9.6} sir.” 

“A\marginnote{10.1} mendicant whose mind is rightly freed like this has achieved six consistent responses. Seeing a sight with the eye, they’re neither happy nor sad, but remain equanimous, mindful and aware. Hearing a sound with the ears … Smelling an odor with the nose … Tasting a flavor with the tongue … Feeling a touch with the body … Knowing a thought with the mind, they’re neither happy nor sad, but remain equanimous, mindful and aware. Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’ They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, being no longer relished, will become cool right here.’ 

Suppose\marginnote{11.1} there was a shadow cast by a sacrificial post. Then along comes a person with a spade and basket. They cut down the sacrificial post at its base, dig it up, and pull it out by its roots, right down to the fibers and stems. Then they split it apart, cut up the parts, and chop them into splinters. Next they dry the splinters in the wind and sun, burn them with fire, and reduce them to ashes. Then they sweep away the ashes in a strong wind, or float them away down a swift stream. And so the shadow cast by the post is cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. 

In\marginnote{12.1} the same way, a mendicant whose mind is rightly freed like this has achieved six consistent responses. Seeing a sight with the eye, they’re neither happy nor sad, but remain equanimous, mindful and aware. Hearing a sound with the ears … Smelling an odor with the nose … Tasting a flavor with the tongue … Feeling a touch with the body … Knowing a thought with the mind, they’re neither happy nor sad, but remain equanimous, mindful and aware. Feeling the end of the body approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of the body approaching.’ Feeling the end of life approaching, they understand: ‘I feel the end of life approaching.’ They understand: ‘When my body breaks up and my life has come to an end, everything that’s felt, being no longer relished, will become cool right here.’” 

When\marginnote{13.1} he said this, Vappa the Sakyan, the disciple of the Jains, said to the Buddha: 

“Sir,\marginnote{13.2} suppose there was a man who raised commercial horses for profit. But he never made any profit, and instead just got weary and frustrated. In the same way, I paid homage to those Jain fools for profit. But I never made any profit, and instead just got weary and frustrated. From this day forth, any confidence I had in those Jain fools I sweep away as in a strong wind, or float away as down a swift stream. 

Excellent,\marginnote{13.7} sir! … From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Vesālī}, at the Great Wood, in the hall with the peaked roof. Then \textsanskrit{Sāḷha} and Abhaya the Licchavis went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 

“There\marginnote{2.1} are, sir, some ascetics and brahmins who advocate crossing the flood by means of two things: purification of ethics, and mortification in disgust of sin. What does the Buddha say about this?” 

“\textsanskrit{Sāḷha},\marginnote{3.1} purification of ethics is one of the factors of the ascetic life, I say. But those ascetics and brahmins who teach mortification in disgust of sin—regarding it as essential and clinging to it—are incapable of crossing the flood. And those ascetics and brahmins whose livelihood and behavior by way of body, speech, and mind, is not pure are also incapable of knowing and seeing, of supreme awakening. 

Suppose\marginnote{4.1} a man who wanted to cross a river took a sharp axe into a wood. There he’d see a large green sal tree, straight and young and grown free of defects. He’d cut it down at the base, cut off the top, and completely strip off the branches and foliage. Then he’d trim it with axes and machetes, plane it, and sand it with a rock. Finally, he’d launch out on the river. 

What\marginnote{5.1} do you think, \textsanskrit{Sāḷha}? Is that man capable of crossing the river?” 

“No,\marginnote{5.3} sir. Why not? Because that green sal tree is well worked on the outside, but inside it’s still not cleared out. I’d expect that green sal tree to sink, and the man to come to ruin.” 

“In\marginnote{6.1} the same way, \textsanskrit{Sāḷha}, those ascetics and brahmins who teach mortification in disgust of sin—regarding it as essential and clinging to it—are incapable of crossing the flood. And those ascetics and brahmins whose livelihood and behavior by way of body, speech, and mind is not pure are also incapable of knowing and seeing, of supreme awakening. 

But\marginnote{7.1} those ascetics and brahmins who don’t teach mortification in disgust of sin—not regarding it as essential or clinging to it—are capable of crossing the flood. And those ascetics and brahmins whose behavior by way of body, speech, and mind is pure are also capable of knowing and seeing, of supreme awakening. 

Suppose\marginnote{8.1} a man who wanted to cross a river took a sharp axe into a wood. There he’d see a large green sal tree, straight and young and grown free of defects. He’d cut it down at the base, cut off the top, and completely strip off the branches and foliage. Then he’d trim it with axes and machetes. Then he’d take a chisel and completely clear it out inside. Then he’d plane it, sand it with a rock, and make it into a boat. Finally he’d fix it with oars and rudder, and launch out on the river. 

What\marginnote{9.1} do you think, \textsanskrit{Sāḷha}? Is that man capable of crossing the river?” 

“Yes,\marginnote{9.3} sir. Why is that? Because that green sal tree is well worked on the outside, cleared out on the inside, made into a boat, and fixed with oars and rudder. I’d expect that boat to not sink, and the man to safely make it to the far shore.” 

“In\marginnote{10.1} the same way, \textsanskrit{Sāḷha}, those ascetics and brahmins who don’t teach mortification in disgust of sin—not regarding it as essential or clinging to it—are capable of crossing the flood. And those ascetics and brahmins whose behavior by way of body, speech, and mind is pure are also capable of knowing and seeing, of supreme awakening. Suppose there was a warrior who knew lots of fancy archery tricks. It is only with these three factors that he becomes worthy of a king, fit to serve a king, and is considered a factor of kingship. What three? He’s a long-distance shooter, a marksman, and one who shatters large objects. 

Just\marginnote{11.1} as a warrior is a long-distance shooter, a noble disciple has right immersion. A noble disciple with right immersion truly sees any kind of form at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near: \emph{all} form—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ They truly see any kind of feeling … perception … choices … consciousness at all—past, future, or present; internal or external; coarse or fine; inferior or superior; far or near, \emph{all} consciousness—with right understanding: ‘This is not mine, I am not this, this is not my self.’ 

Just\marginnote{12.1} as a warrior is a marksman, a noble disciple has right view. A noble disciple with right view truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. 

Just\marginnote{13.1} as a warrior shatters large objects, a noble disciple has right freedom. A noble disciple with right freedom shatters the great mass of ignorance.”

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near \textsanskrit{Sāvatthī} in Jeta’s Grove, \textsanskrit{Anāthapiṇḍika}’s monastery. Then Queen \textsanskrit{Mallikā} went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 

“What\marginnote{2.1} is the cause, sir, what is the reason why in this life some females are ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking; and poor, with few assets and possessions; and insignificant? 

And\marginnote{3.1} why are some females ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking; but rich, affluent, wealthy, and illustrious? 

And\marginnote{4.1} why are some females attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty; but poor, with few assets and possessions; and insignificant? 

And\marginnote{5.1} why are some females attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty; and rich, affluent, wealthy, and illustrious?” 

“Take\marginnote{6.1} a female who is irritable and bad-tempered. Even when criticized a little bit she loses her temper, becoming annoyed, hostile, and hard-hearted, and displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness. She doesn’t give to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. And she’s jealous, envying, resenting, and begrudging the possessions, honor, respect, reverence, homage, and veneration given to others. If she comes back to this state of existence after passing away, wherever she is reborn she’s ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking; and poor, with few assets and possessions; and insignificant. 

Take\marginnote{7.1} another female who is irritable and bad-tempered. … But she does give to ascetics or brahmins … And she’s not jealous … If she comes back to this state of existence after passing away, wherever she is reborn she’s ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking; but rich, affluent, wealthy, and illustrious. 

Take\marginnote{8.1} another female who isn’t irritable and bad-tempered. … But she doesn’t give to ascetics or brahmins … And she’s jealous … If she comes back to this state of existence after passing away, wherever she is reborn she’s attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty; but poor, with few assets and possessions; and insignificant. 

Take\marginnote{9.1} another female who isn’t irritable and bad-tempered. … She gives to ascetics and brahmins … And she’s not jealous … If she comes back to this state of existence after passing away, wherever she is reborn she’s attractive, good-looking, lovely, of surpassing beauty; and rich, affluent, wealthy, and illustrious. 

This\marginnote{10.1} is why some females are ugly … and poor … and insignificant. And some females are ugly … but rich … and illustrious. And some females are attractive … but poor … and insignificant. And some females are attractive … and rich … and illustrious.” 

When\marginnote{11.1} this was said, Queen \textsanskrit{Mallikā} said to the Buddha: 

“Sir,\marginnote{11.2} in another life I must have been irritable and bad-tempered. Even when lightly criticized I must have lost my temper, becoming annoyed, hostile, and hard-hearted, and displaying annoyance, hate, and bitterness. For now I am ugly, unattractive, and bad-looking. 

In\marginnote{12.1} another life I must have given to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. For now I am rich, affluent, and wealthy. 

In\marginnote{13.1} another life, I must not have been jealous, envying, resenting, and begrudging the possessions, honor, respect, reverence, homage, and veneration given to others. For now I am illustrious. In this royal court I command maidens of the aristocrats, brahmins, and householders. So, sir, from this day forth I will not be irritable and bad-tempered. Even when heavily criticized I won’t lose my temper, become annoyed, hostile, and hard-hearted, or display annoyance, hate, and bitterness. I will give to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. I will not be jealous, envying, resenting, and begrudging the possessions, honor, respect, reverence, homage, and veneration given to others. 

Excellent,\marginnote{13.7} sir! … From this day forth, may the Buddha remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.”

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.1} these four people are found in the world. What four? 

\begin{enumerate}%
\item One person mortifies themselves, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves. %
\item One person mortifies others, pursuing the practice of mortifying others. %
\item One person mortifies themselves and others, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves and others. %
\item One person neither mortifies themselves nor others, pursuing the practice of not mortifying themselves or others. They live without wishes in the present life, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, having become holy in themselves. %
\end{enumerate}

And\marginnote{2.1} how does one person mortify themselves, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves? It’s when someone goes naked, ignoring conventions. They lick their hands, and don’t come or wait when called. They don’t consent to food brought to them, or food prepared on purpose for them, or an invitation for a meal. They don’t receive anything from a pot or bowl; or from someone who keeps sheep, or who has a weapon or a shovel in their home; or where a couple is eating; or where there is a woman who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or who has a man in her home; or where there’s a dog waiting or flies buzzing. They accept no fish or meat or liquor or wine, and drink no beer. They go to just one house for alms, taking just one mouthful, or two houses and two mouthfuls, up to seven houses and seven mouthfuls. They feed on one saucer a day, two saucers a day, up to seven saucers a day. They eat once a day, once every second day, up to once a week, and so on, even up to once a fortnight. They live pursuing the practice of eating food at set intervals. 

They\marginnote{3.1} eat herbs, millet, wild rice, poor rice, water lettuce, rice bran, scum from boiling rice, sesame flour, grass, or cow dung. They survive on forest roots and fruits, or eating fallen fruit. 

They\marginnote{4.1} wear robes of sunn hemp, mixed hemp, corpse-wrapping cloth, rags, lodh tree bark, antelope hide (whole or in strips), kusa grass, bark, wood-chips, human hair, horse-tail hair, or owls’ wings. They tear out hair and beard, pursuing this practice. They constantly stand, refusing seats. They squat, committed to the endeavor of squatting. They lie on a mat of thorns, making a mat of thorns their bed. They pursue the practice of immersion in water three times a day, including the evening. And so they live pursuing these various ways of mortifying and tormenting the body. That’s how one person mortifies themselves, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves. 

And\marginnote{5.1} how does one person mortify others, pursuing the practice of mortifying others? It’s when a person is a slaughterer of sheep, pigs, poultry, or deer, a hunter or fisher, a bandit, an executioner, a butcher of cattle, a jailer, or has some other cruel livelihood. That’s how one person mortifies others, pursuing the practice of mortifying others. 

And\marginnote{6.1} how does one person mortify themselves and others, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves and others? It’s when a person is an anointed aristocratic king or a well-to-do brahmin. He has a new temple built to the east of the city. He shaves off his hair and beard, dresses in a rough antelope hide, and smears his body with ghee and oil. Scratching his back with antlers, he enters the temple with his chief queen and the brahmin high priest. There he lies on the bare ground strewn with grass. The king feeds on the milk from one teat of a cow that has a calf of the same color. The chief queen feeds on the milk from the second teat. The brahmin high priest feeds on the milk from the third teat. The milk from the fourth teat is served to the sacred flame. The calf feeds on the remainder. He says: ‘Slaughter this many bulls, bullocks, heifers, goats, rams, and horses for the sacrifice! Fell this many trees and reap this much grass for the sacrificial equipment!’ His bondservants, workers, and staff do their jobs under threat of punishment and danger, weeping, with tearful faces. That’s how one person mortifies themselves and others, pursuing the practice of mortifying themselves and others. 

And\marginnote{7.1} how does one person neither mortify themselves nor others, pursuing the practice of not mortifying themselves or others, living without wishes in the present life, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, having become holy in themselves? It’s when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. He has realized with his own insight this world—with its gods, \textsanskrit{Māras} and \textsanskrit{Brahmās}, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans—and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in some good family. They gain faith in the Realized One, and reflect: ‘Living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 

Once\marginnote{8.1} they’ve gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings. They give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving. They give up unchastity. They are celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex. They give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and trustworthy, and don’t trick the world with their words. They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony. They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable, and agreeable to the people. They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial. 

They\marginnote{9.1} refrain from injuring plants and seeds. They eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time. They refrain from dancing, singing, music, and seeing shows. They refrain from beautifying and adorning themselves with garlands, fragrance, and makeup. They refrain from high and luxurious beds. They refrain from receiving gold and money, raw grains, raw meat, women and girls, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants, cows, horses, and mares, and fields and land. They refrain from running errands and messages; buying and selling; falsifying weights, metals, or measures; bribery, fraud, cheating, and duplicity; mutilation, murder, abduction, banditry, plunder, and violence. 

They’re\marginnote{10.1} content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden. In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and almsfood to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves. 

Seeing\marginnote{11.1} a sight with the eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving restraint over it. Hearing a sound with the ears … Smelling an odor with the nose … Tasting a flavor with the tongue … Feeling a touch with the body … Knowing a thought with the mind, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving restraint over it. When they have this noble sense restraint, they experience an unsullied bliss inside themselves. 

They\marginnote{12.1} act with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent. 

When\marginnote{13.1} they have this noble spectrum of ethics, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness, they frequent a secluded lodging—a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw. After the meal, they return from almsround, sit down cross-legged with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there. Giving up desire for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of desire, cleansing the mind of desire. Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will. Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness. Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse. Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt. They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption … second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. 

When\marginnote{14.1} their mind has become immersed in \textsanskrit{samādhi} like this—purified, bright, flawless, rid of corruptions, pliable, workable, steady, and imperturbable—they extend it toward recollection of past lives … knowledge of the death and rebirth of sentient beings … knowledge of the ending of defilements. They truly understand: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’. They truly understand: ‘These are defilements’ … ‘This is the origin of defilements’ … ‘This is the cessation of defilements’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of defilements’. 

Knowing\marginnote{15.1} and seeing like this, their mind is freed from the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, and ignorance. When they’re freed, they know they’re freed. 

They\marginnote{15.3} understand: ‘Rebirth is ended, the spiritual journey has been completed, what had to be done has been done, there is no return to any state of existence.’ That’s how one person neither mortifies themselves nor others, pursuing the practice of not mortifying themselves or others, living without wishes in the present life, extinguished, cooled, experiencing bliss, having become holy in themselves. 

These\marginnote{15.6} are the four people found in the world.”

The\marginnote{1.1} Buddha said this: 

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.2} I will teach you about craving—the weaver, the migrant, the creeping, the clinging. This world is choked by it, engulfed by it. It makes the world tangled like yarn, knotted like a ball of thread, and matted like rushes and reeds, not escaping the places of loss, the bad places, the underworld, transmigration. Listen and pay close attention, I will speak.” 

“Yes,\marginnote{1.4} sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this: 

“And\marginnote{2.1} what is that craving …? There are eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior, and eighteen that derive from the exterior. 

What\marginnote{3.1} are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior? When there is the concept ‘I am’, there are the concepts ‘I am such’, ‘I am thus’, ‘I am otherwise’; ‘I am fleeting’, ‘I am lasting’; ‘mine’, ‘such is mine’, ‘thus is mine’, ‘otherwise is mine’; ‘also mine’, ‘such is also mine’, ‘thus is also mine’, ‘otherwise is also mine’; ‘I will be’, ‘I will be such’, ‘I will be thus’, ‘I will be otherwise’. These are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior. 

What\marginnote{4.1} are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the exterior? When there is the concept ‘I am because of this’, there are the concepts ‘I am such because of this’, ‘I am thus because of this’, ‘I am otherwise because of this’; ‘I am fleeting because of this’, ‘I am lasting because of this’; ‘mine because of this’, ‘such is mine because of this’, ‘thus is mine because of this’, ‘otherwise is mine because of this’; ‘also mine because of this’, ‘such is also mine because of this’, ‘thus is also mine because of this’, ‘otherwise is also mine because of this’; ‘I will be because of this’, ‘I will be such because of this’, ‘I will be thus because of this’, ‘I will be otherwise because of this’. These are the eighteen currents of craving that derive from the exterior. 

So\marginnote{5.1} there are eighteen currents of craving that derive from the interior, and eighteen that derive from the exterior. These are called the thirty-six currents of craving. Each of these pertain to the past, future, and present, making one hundred and eight currents of craving. 

This\marginnote{6.1} is that craving—the weaver, the migrant, the creeping, the clinging. This world is choked by it, engulfed by it. It makes the world tangled like yarn, knotted like a ball of thread, and matted like rushes and reeds, not escaping the places of loss, the bad places, the underworld, transmigration.”

“Mendicants,\marginnote{1.1} these four things are born of love and hate. What four? 

\begin{enumerate}%
\item Love is born of love, %
\item hate is born of love, %
\item love is born of hate, and %
\item hate is born of hate. %
\end{enumerate}

And\marginnote{2.1} how is love born of love? It’s when someone likes, loves, and cares for a person. Others treat that person with liking, love, and care. They think: ‘These others like the person I like.’ And so love for them springs up. That’s how love is born of love. 

And\marginnote{3.1} how is hate born of love? It’s when someone likes, loves, and cares for a person. Others treat that person with disliking, loathing, and detestation. They think: ‘These others dislike the person I like.’ And so hate for them springs up. That’s how hate is born of love. 

And\marginnote{4.1} how is love born of hate? It’s when someone dislikes, loathes, and detests a person. Others treat that person with disliking, loathing, and detestation. They think: ‘These others dislike the person I dislike.’ And so love for them springs up. That’s how love is born of hate. 

And\marginnote{5.1} how is hate born of hate? It’s when someone dislikes, loathes, and detests a person. Others treat that person with liking, love, and care. They think: ‘These others like the person I dislike.’ And so hate for them springs up. That’s how hate is born of hate. 

These\marginnote{5.8} are the four things that are born of love and hate. 

A\marginnote{6.1} time comes when a mendicant … enters and remains in the first absorption. At that time they have no love born of love, hate born of love, love born of hate, or hate born of hate. 

A\marginnote{7.1} time comes when a mendicant … enters and remains in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption. At that time they have no love born of love, hate born of love, love born of hate, or hate born of hate. 

A\marginnote{8.1} time comes when a mendicant realizes the undefiled freedom of heart and freedom by wisdom in this very life. And they live having realized it with their own insight due to the ending of defilements. At that time any love born of love, hate born of love, love born of hate, or hate born of hate is given up, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. This is called a mendicant who doesn’t draw close or push back or fume or ignite or burn up. 

And\marginnote{9.1} how does a mendicant draw close? It’s when a mendicant regards form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They regard feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in self, or self in feeling. They regard perception as self, self as having perception, perception in self, or self in perception. They regard choices as self, self as having choices, choices in self, or self in choices. They regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. That’s how a mendicant draws close. 

And\marginnote{10.1} how does a mendicant not draw close? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They don’t regard feeling as self, self as having feeling, feeling in self, or self in feeling. They don’t regard perception as self, self as having perception, perception in self, or self in perception. They don’t regard choices as self, self as having choices, choices in self, or self in choices. They don’t regard consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. That’s how a mendicant doesn’t draw close. 

And\marginnote{11.1} how does a mendicant push back? It’s when someone abuses, annoys, or argues with a mendicant, and the mendicant abuses, annoys, or argues back at them. That’s how a mendicant pushes back. 

And\marginnote{12.1} how does a mendicant not push back? It’s when someone abuses, annoys, or argues with a mendicant, and the mendicant doesn’t abuse, annoy, or argue back at them. That’s how a mendicant doesn’t push back. 

And\marginnote{13.1} how does a mendicant fume? When there is the concept ‘I am’, there are the concepts ‘I am such’, ‘I am thus’, ‘I am otherwise’; ‘I am fleeting’, ‘I am lasting’; ‘mine’, ‘such is mine’, ‘thus is mine’, ‘otherwise is mine’; ‘also mine’, ‘such is also mine’, ‘thus is also mine’, ‘otherwise is also mine’; ‘I will be’, ‘I will be such’, ‘I will be thus’, ‘I will be otherwise’. That’s how a mendicant fumes. 

And\marginnote{14.1} how does a mendicant not fume? When there is no concept ‘I am’, there are no concepts ‘I am such’, ‘I am thus’, ‘I am otherwise’; ‘I am fleeting’, ‘I am lasting’; ‘mine’, ‘such is mine’, ‘thus is mine’, ‘otherwise is mine’; ‘also mine’, ‘such is also mine’, ‘thus is also mine’, ‘otherwise is also mine’; ‘I will be’, ‘I will be such’, ‘I will be thus’, ‘I will be otherwise’. That’s how a mendicant doesn’t fume. 

And\marginnote{15.1} how is a mendicant ignited? When there is the concept ‘I am because of this’, there are the concepts ‘I am such because of this’, ‘I am thus because of this’, ‘I am otherwise because of this’; ‘I am fleeting because of this’, ‘I am lasting because of this’; ‘mine because of this’, ‘such is mine because of this’, ‘thus is mine because of this’, ‘otherwise is mine because of this’; ‘also mine because of this’, ‘such is also mine because of this’, ‘thus is also mine because of this’, ‘otherwise is also mine because of this’; ‘I will be because of this’, ‘I will be such because of this’, ‘I will be thus because of this’, ‘I will be otherwise because of this’. That’s how a mendicant is ignited. 

And\marginnote{16.1} how is a mendicant not ignited? When there is no concept ‘I am because of this’, there are no concepts ‘I am such because of this’, ‘I am thus because of this’, ‘I am otherwise because of this’; ‘I am fleeting because of this’, ‘I am lasting because of this’; ‘mine because of this’, ‘such is mine because of this’, ‘thus is mine because of this’, ‘otherwise is mine because of this’; ‘also mine because of this’, ‘such is also mine because of this’, ‘thus is also mine because of this’, ‘otherwise is also mine because of this’; ‘I will be because of this’, ‘I will be such because of this’, ‘I will be thus because of this’, ‘I will be otherwise because of this’. That’s how a mendicant is not ignited. 

And\marginnote{17.1} how does a mendicant burn up? It’s when a mendicant hasn’t given up the conceit ‘I am’, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future. That’s how a mendicant is burned up. 

And\marginnote{18.1} how does a mendicant not burn up? It’s when a mendicant has given up the conceit ‘I am’, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it, so it’s unable to arise in the future. That’s how a mendicant is not burned up.”

Having made these choices, they’re reborn in a pleasing world, where pleasing contacts strike them.

Then\marginnote{1.1} \textsanskrit{Sikhāmoggallāna} the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, \textsanskrit{Sikhāmoggallāna} sat down to one side, and said to the Buddha: 

“Master\marginnote{2.1} Gotama, a few days ago the student \textsanskrit{Soṇakāyana} came to me and said: ‘The ascetic Gotama advocates not doing any deeds. So he teaches the annihilation of the world!’ The world exists through deeds, and it remains because deeds are undertaken.” 

“Brahmin,\marginnote{3.1} I can’t recall even seeing the student \textsanskrit{Soṇakāyana}, so how could we possibly have had such a discussion? I declare these four kinds of deeds, having realized them with my own insight. What four?

These are called bright deeds with bright results. 

And\marginnote{6.1} what are dark and bright deeds with dark and bright results? It’s when someone makes both hurtful and pleasing choices by way of body, speech, and mind. … Touched by both hurtful and pleasing contacts, they experience both hurtful and pleasing feelings that are a mixture of pleasure and pain—like humans, some gods, and some beings in the underworld. These are called dark and bright deeds with dark and bright results.

At\marginnote{1.1} one time the Buddha was staying near Kosambi, in Ghosita’s Monastery. Then Venerable Ānanda went up to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him, “Well, Ānanda, has that disciplinary issue been settled yet?” 

“How\marginnote{1.4} could it be, sir? Venerable Anuruddha’s pupil \textsanskrit{Bāhiya} remains entirely committed to creating a schism in the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}. But Anuruddha doesn’t think to say a single word about it.” 

“But\marginnote{2.1} Ānanda, since when has Anuruddha been involved in disciplinary issues in the midst of the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}? Shouldn’t you, together with \textsanskrit{Sāriputta} and \textsanskrit{Moggallāna}, settle all disciplinary issues that come up? 

A\marginnote{3.1} bad monk sees four reasons to relish schism in the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}. What four? Take an unethical monk, of bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual practitioner—though claiming to be one—rotten inside, corrupt, and depraved. He thinks: ‘Suppose the monks know that I’m a bad monk … If they’re in harmony, they’ll expel me, but if they’re divided they won’t.’ A bad monk sees this as the first reason to relish schism in the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{4.1} a bad monk has wrong view, he’s attached to an extremist view. He thinks: ‘Suppose the monks know that I have wrong view … If they’re in harmony they’ll expel me, but if they’re divided they won’t.’ A bad monk sees this as the second reason to relish schism in the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{5.1} a bad monk has wrong livelihood and earns a living by wrong livelihood. He thinks: ‘Suppose the monks know that I have wrong livelihood … If they’re in harmony they’ll expel me, but if they’re divided they won’t.’ A bad monk sees this as the third reason to relish schism in the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}. 

Furthermore,\marginnote{6.1} a bad monk desires material possessions, honor, and admiration. He thinks: ‘Suppose the monks know that I desire material possessions, honor, and admiration. If they’re in harmony they won’t honor, respect, revere, or venerate me, but if they’re divided they will.’ A bad monk sees this as the fourth reason to relish schism in the \textsanskrit{Saṅgha}.

Suppose\marginnote{1.3} they were to arrest a bandit, a criminal and present him to the king, saying: ‘Your Majesty, this is a bandit, a criminal. May Your Majesty punish them!’ The king would say: ‘Go, my men, and tie this man’s arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope. Shave his head and march him from street to street and square to square to the beating of a harsh drum. Then take him out the south gate and there, to the south of the city, chop off his head.’ The king’s men would do as they were told. Then a bystander might think: ‘This man must have done a truly bad and reprehensible deed, a capital offense.

Suppose\marginnote{2.1} a man was to put on a black cloth, mess up his hair, and put a club on his shoulder. Then he approaches a large crowd and says: ‘Sirs, I’ve done a bad and reprehensible deed, deserving of clubbing.

It can be expected that if they haven’t committed a suspension offense they won’t, and if they committed one they will deal with it properly. 

Suppose\marginnote{3.1} a man was to put on a black cloth, mess up his hair, and put a sack of ashes on his shoulder.

It can be expected that if they haven’t committed a confessable offense they won’t, and if they committed one they will deal with it properly. 

Suppose\marginnote{4.1} a man was to put on a black cloth and mess up his hair. Then he approaches a large crowd and says: ‘Sirs, I’ve done a bad and reprehensible deed, deserving of criticism. I submit to your pleasure.’ Then a bystander might think: ‘This man must have done a truly bad and reprehensible deed, deserving of criticism. … There’s no way I’d ever do such a bad and reprehensible deed, deserving of criticism.’ In the same way, take any monk or nun who has set up such an acute perception of peril regarding acknowledgable offenses.

Then\marginnote{1.1} Venerable \textsanskrit{Māluṅkyaputta} went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.1} may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief. When I’ve heard it, I’ll live alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute.” 

“Well\marginnote{2.2} now, \textsanskrit{Māluṅkyaputta}, what are we to say to the young monks, when even an old man like you, elderly and senior, asks the Realized One for brief advice?” 

“Sir,\marginnote{2.4} may the Buddha please teach me Dhamma in brief! May the Holy One teach me the Dhamma in brief! Hopefully I can understand the meaning of what the Buddha says! Hopefully I can be an heir of the Buddha’s teaching!” 

“\textsanskrit{Māluṅkyaputta},\marginnote{3.1} there are four things that give rise to craving in a mendicant. What four? For the sake of robes, almsfood, lodgings, or rebirth in this or that state. These are the four things that give rise to craving in a mendicant. That craving is given up by a mendicant, cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. Then they’re called a mendicant who has cut off craving, untied the fetters, and by rightly comprehending conceit has made an end of suffering.” 

When\marginnote{4.1} \textsanskrit{Māluṅkyaputta} had been given this advice by the Buddha, he got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right, before leaving. Then \textsanskrit{Māluṅkyaputta}, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme culmination of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness. 

He\marginnote{4.3} understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable \textsanskrit{Māluṅkyaputta} became one of the perfected.

\section*{The Translator}

Bhikkhu Sujato was born as Anthony Aidan Best on 4/11/1966 in Perth, Western Australia. He grew up in the pleasant suburbs of Mt Lawley and Attadale alongside his sister Nicola, who was the good child. His mother, Margaret Lorraine Huntsman née Pinder, said “he’ll either be a priest or a poet”, while his father, Anthony Thomas Best, advised him to “never do anything for money”. He attended Aquinas College, a Catholic school, where he decided to become an atheist. At the University of WA he studied philosophy, aiming to learn what he wanted to do with his life. Finding that what he wanted to do was play guitar, he dropped out. His main band was named Martha’s Vineyard, which achieved modest success in the indie circuit. 

A seemingly random encounter with a roadside joey took him to Thailand, where he entered his first meditation retreat at Wat Ram Poeng, Chieng Mai in 1992. Feeling the call to the Buddha’s path, he took full ordination in Wat Pa Nanachat in 1994, where his teachers were Ajahn Pasanno and Ajahn Jayasaro. In 1997 he returned to Perth to study with Ajahn Brahm at Bodhinyana Monastery. 

He spent several years practicing in seclusion in Malaysia and Thailand before establishing Santi Forest Monastery in Bundanoon, NSW, in 2003. There he was instrumental in supporting the establishment of the Theravada bhikkhuni order in Australia and advocating for women’s rights. He continues to teach in Australia and globally, with a special concern for the moral implications of climate change and other forms of environmental destruction. He has published a series of books of original and groundbreaking research on early Buddhism. 

In 2005 he founded SuttaCentral together with Rod Bucknell and John Kelly. In 2015, seeing the need for a complete, accurate, plain English translation of the Pali texts, he undertook the task, spending nearly three years in isolation on the isle of Qi Mei off the coast of the nation of Taiwan. He completed the four main \textsanskrit{Nikāyas} in 2018, and the early books of the Khuddaka \textsanskrit{Nikāya} were complete by 2021. All this work is dedicated to the public domain and is entirely free of copyright encumbrance. 

In 2019 he returned to Sydney where he established Lokanta Vihara (The Monastery at the End of the World). 

\section*{Creation Process}

Primary source was the digital \textsanskrit{Mahāsaṅgīti} edition of the Pali \textsanskrit{Tipiṭaka}. Translated from the Pali, with reference to several English translations, especially those of Bhikkhu Bodhi.

\section*{The Translation}

This translation was part of a project to translate the four Pali \textsanskrit{Nikāyas} with the following aims: plain, approachable English; consistent terminology; accurate rendition of the Pali; free of copyright. It was made during 2016–2018 while Bhikkhu Sujato was staying in Qimei, Taiwan.

SuttaCentral publishes early Buddhist texts. Since 2005 we have provided root texts in Pali, Chinese, Sanskrit, Tibetan, and other languages, parallels between these texts, and translations in many modern languages. We build on the work of generations of scholars, and offer our contribution freely.

SuttaCentral is driven by volunteer contributions, and in addition we employ professional developers. We offer a sponsorship program for high quality translations from the original languages. Financial support for SuttaCentral is handled by the SuttaCentral Development Trust, a charitable trust registered in Australia.

\section*{About Bilara}

“Bilara” means “cat” in Pali, and it is the name of our Computer Assisted Translation (CAT) software. Bilara is a web app that enables translators to translate early Buddhist texts into their own language. These translations are published on SuttaCentral with the root text and translation side by side.

\section*{About SuttaCentral Editions}

The SuttaCentral Editions project makes high quality books from selected Bilara translations. These are published in formats including HTML, EPUB, PDF, and print.

If you want to print any of our Editions, please let us know and we will help prepare a file to your specifications.
